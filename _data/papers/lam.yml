  <p>This paper proposes a theory of relative modality in English pastoral music
  that echoes recent research into rock music’s ambiguous diatonic modes (e.g.,
  between “relative” keys C major and A aeolian). The theory draws from
  contemporaneous sources, including Cecil Sharp’s seminal folk-song theory and
  Sarah Glover’s <i>Tonic Sol-fa </i>system, a <i>la</i>-based minor solfège
  that was popularized and institutionalized by Jon Curwen. Relative modality’s
  two fundamental components are its single diatonic scale and multiple tone
  centers therein. Using the English dorian mode as a case study, this paper
  argues for a “double syntax” (after Cohn 2012) based on centricity and scale.
  Note-relation based on centricity is encoded as the familiar scale degree
  (<i>do</i>-based minor solfège), but note-relation based on scale
  (<i>la</i>-based minor solfège) has little recognition in the field of music
  theory. I call it <i>diatonic position </i>(intervallic positions within a
  scale), and this apparently simple theoretical construct has several
  non-obvious ramifications, among which is the ability to unite multiple
  different centric hearings under one roof and to describe a continuity between
  them that no existing analytical methodology can easily afford. I will examine
  dorian passages from Cecil Sharp’s arrangement of the folk song “Sweet Kitty”
  and Gustav Holst’s First Suite for Military Band in E-flat major, op. 28, both
  of which exemplify a dynamic balance between scale and centricity in English
  pastoral music. </p>
