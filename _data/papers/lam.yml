abstract: |
    <p>This paper proposes <i>modal spelled pitch class</i> (mspc) as an
    extension upon Julian Hook’s spelled heptachords (2011). Mspcs formally
    specify the tonic for the analysis of diatonic, centric music. The
    theory’s utility is similar to that of Steven Rings’s Tonal GIS (2011);
    however, while Rings’s theory is based on mod-12 pitch classes, Hook’s
    system is situated on the line of fifths, and it represents diatonic
    objects more efficiently and elegantly.</p>

    <p>Mspcs take the form of an ordered triple that includes the key
    signature, the generic pitch class (gpc, letter name without accidentals)
    of the note in question, and the tonic’s gpc. The structure of the group
    is <nobr>ℤ × ℤ<sub>7</sub> × ℤ<sub>7</sub>,</nobr> and the group forms an interval
    space (Lewinian GIS).  Although the three components could be transposed
    independently, I will focus on the <i>coordinated transpositions</i> of
    these components.  Coordinated transpositions correspond to familiar
    compositional devices such as diatonic transposition, parallel inflection,
    scale-degree reinterpretation, chromatic modulation, etc., which are all
    abstract transpositions within my framework.</p>

    <p>I will demonstrate analytical usage that intersects with the
    triadic-transformational analyses of nineteenth-century chromatic
    mediants, and burgeoning research in diatonic modality. The paper
    concludes with a few notable mspc T-nets, including Schubert’s Piano
    Sonata in B-flat major and Holst’s First Suite for Military Band.</p>
