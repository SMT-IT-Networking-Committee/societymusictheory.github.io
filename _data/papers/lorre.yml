abstract: |
  <p>Years before Muddy Waters was rebranded a folk singer by a 1964 Chess Records LP, British critics and record labels consistently adhered to a conspicuously rural presentation of him and his brand of Chicago-based electric blues. In 1955, the same year that Waters’s “Mannish Boy” reached number five on the American R&B chart, the late Paul Oliver celebrated the singer for his “adherence to the traditional blues of the Delta.” The following year, “Mannish Boy” was reissued in the UK on a London Records’ EP featuring a sketch of Waters in a straw hat and overalls strumming an acoustic guitar. More than sixty years later, the folkloric tone of a September 2017 Third Man Records’ press release announcing the reissue of “Mannish Boy” on seven-inch vinyl indicates that many of those most interested in celebrating Muddy Waters still insist upon hearing him as a Mississippi-born country bluesman.</p>
  <p>This paper interrogates the potential discursive force of vinyl record album packaging at mid-century. In particular, I discuss how a set of ideological and representational strategies employed by American and British record labels between the initial rise of rock ’n’ roll (1955) and the British Invasion (1964) that worked to recast the professional, urban, popular Muddy Waters as a folk artist. I will demonstrate how notes, album imagery and promotional material used on the Chess Records LPs <i>At Newport 1960</i> and <i>Folk Singer</i> as well as the British EP reissue <i>Mississippi Blues</i> (1956) on the London-American label—records intended for white, middle-class markets—worked to elide Waters’ many commercial successes with African American audiences in order to understand him as the last vestige of a pre-industrial, agrarian tradition.</p>
