  <p>Donald Francis Tovey once stated that, in Schubert’s three-key expositions,
  “the most obviously wrong digressions . . . [press] towards new forms” (Tovey
  1927, 122). In this, he seemed to imply that Schubert’s two-key and three-key
  expositions are examples of separate practices. By all appearances, scholars
  seem to agree. However, what has been left out of this understanding is that
  Schubert’s three-key expositions are not the only examples of sonata-form
  expositions containing large-scale digressions towards unexpected key areas;
  for many of Schubert’s so-called two-key expositions also house such passages
  (e.g., D. 103/I, D. 804/I, and D. 887/I). </p>
  <p>Current scholarship of Schubert’s sonata forms suggests a clear division
  between two- and three-key expositions. However, when one compares Schubert’s
  three-key expositions with two-key expositions containing harmonic
  digressions, a previously unacknowledged link between the two formal types
  begins to emerge, suggesting that the supposed clear line between two- and
  three-key expositions is not as defined within his music as previously
  believed. This paper, therefore, argues for a reconceptualization of
  Schubert’s sonata-form practices in which his two- and three-key expositions
  are not viewed as a binary, but as part of a continuum. In this way, we see a
  composer whose experimental work in adding additional keys to sonata-form
  expositions allowed him to unlock a host of new sonata-form procedures.</p>
