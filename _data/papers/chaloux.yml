    <p>Kofi Agawu (2004) responded to Joseph Kerman's (1980) critique of music analysis by stating that “analysis is most productively understood and practiced as a mode of performance and as a mode of composition” (273). In Agawu's hunt for the meaning of Adorno's "truth content," he comes to the conclusion that “the truth content is not necessarily a literal, empirical truth but rather a dynamic, motivating truth designed partly to anchor listening in specific sociocultural and historical moments even while…releasing the analyst from the dubious responsibility of having to establish the authenticity of the analysis.” In other words, analysts do not engage in empirical truth finding when analyzing music.</p>
    <p>Recent court cases (<em>Williams v. Gaye</em> [2018], <em>Gray v. Perry</em> [2019]) have shown how competing testimony from forensic musicologists creates confusion for the jury tasked with ruling on copyright infringement. As Booth (2016) states: “Chief among the typical problems is that experts [forensic musicologists] will often aggregate their objective findings to arrive at a subjective conclusion that is outside the scope of their duties as an expert” (123–24). While certain aspects of a musical work are objective (such as the key and time signature), most debates about “substantial similarity” inside the courtroom ask forensic musicologists to engage in interpretation of subjective musical elements. But as Booth noted, this is outside the scope of the expert witness within the courtroom. Debates over these subjective musical elements and their impact on "substantial similarity" often leads the judge to declare a “battle of the experts” and let the competing testimony be heard in trial. Such “battles” often confuse the layman jury and offer little help in resolving the case. </p>
    <p>In exposing the paradox between the act of analysis and the role of an expert witness, this paper suggests ethical guidelines for forensic musicologists to consider when testifying in a case. Through neutral language, emphasis on objective musical elements, and clear indication of subjective interpretation, forensic musicologists can navigate the ethical minefield of the paradox between music analysis and expert testimony.</p>
