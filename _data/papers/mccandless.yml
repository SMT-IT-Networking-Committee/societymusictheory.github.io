abstract: |
    <p>Due to an intricate power structure at play during an often lengthy
    composition and revision process, producers of background music for
    television frequently need to take a non-linear, mobile approach to
    writing music that is eventually perceived as being linear. While this
    mobile approach is reminiscent of those by Brown, Boulez, and Stockhausen,
    it correlates most strongly with Pousseur’s method of creating
    <i>Scambi</i> (1957), an avant-garde piece in which the composer discussed
    aiming for “complete continuity” by composing flexible modules with
    beginnings and endings that were “of like quality” that could be combined
    in several ways without transitions between them (Pousseur 1959).</p>
    <p>In this poster presentation, I provide a “harmonic pathing model”
    (following Thomas 2016) that can be used in the composition of rock tracks
    for production libraries in order to ensure harmonic flow between sections
    despite any potential formal reordering, while adhering to principles
    of idiomatic progression in pop/rock genres as theorized by
    Christopher Doll (2017).</p>
    <p>Following the introduction to my harmonic pathing model, I provide a
    meta-analysis of a corpus of 237 rock tracks from the Emmy-nominated RRHOT
    production library (CBS, CBS Sports), in which I discuss the degree to
    which pathing model adherence may play a role in overall track flexibility
    and, ultimately, library acceptance. Lastly, I discuss the broader
    implications of this harmonic pathing model, which provides a helpful
    pedagogical and compositional tool for pop/rock music more generally.</p>
