title: "The Grateful Dead’s ‘Blues for Allah’: Syncretic Composition in Mid-1970s Rock Music"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>The Grateful Dead’s extended composition “Blues for Allah” is a singular,
  syncretic composition, fusing passages of blues- or folk-derived harmony,
  gospel vocal elements, and rock instrumentation with a highly chromatic main
  theme using all twelve pitch-classes, along with a developmental middle
  section made up of a structured post-tonal collective improvisation. We will
  show how unity is preserved both with the consistent use of similar types of
  stepwise descending melodic movement and with motion between the pitch centers
  of F and E—not only between phrases in the main theme but also between and
  across sections. </p>
  <p>Diverse analytical methods are required for the various musical
  vocabularies that we find in this piece. The main theme is most usefully
  analyzed in terms of pitch-class sets, showing its intricate compositional
  unity. In contrast, when considering other sections, modal or functional
  harmonic analysis are more germane. Examining linear counterpoint between the
  bass and lead guitar lines is helpful when analyzing the long improvised
  middle section “Sand Castles and Glass Camels.” It is in the fusion of and
  transitions between these diverse sections that the composition derives its
  unique strength, a characteristic undergirded by its overall formal integrity.
  </p>
  <p>In order to consider how the form evolved, we will compare two different
  versions: first, an early, proto-, twice-performed one; second, its final
  recorded version, which was performed live only once, after which it
  disappeared from the band’s performing repertoire.</p>
