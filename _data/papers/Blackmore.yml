    <p>The <em>Querelle des Bouffons</em>, that vicious dispute between supporters of French and Italian music, occurred simultaneously with a parallel revolution in operatic style, occurring not on the official operatic stages of the Opéra, but at the Théâtre des Petits Cabinets, the private theater of Louis XV’s official mistress, the Marquise de Pompadour—who served as both its patron and prima donna. The Marquise oversaw a number of key musical innovations associated with the Italian style, including a greater degree of topical variety and a new emphasis on melodic simplicity. </p>
    <p>I suggest a new context for the <em>Querelle</em>: the vocalizing body of de Pompadour, a literal <em>corps sonore</em>. De Pompadour’s vocal lines contain an idiosyncratic system of musical notation, suggesting that the works that she commissioned were tailored to the limitations of her voice. I contend that the royal mistress embraced the more melodic Italian <em>buffa</em> style because it better disguised her vocal shortcomings, while also aspiring towards the stylistic prestige of French <em>tragédie lyrique</em>. Thus, the repertoire of the Petits Cabinets embodied the music-theoretical tensions of the <em>Querelle</em>, questioning the assumed dominance of harmony over melody and the incommensurability of French and Italian styles. </p>
    <p>I read this stylistic tension against the writings of the Marquise’s private physician, François Quesnay, who believed that the royal mistress should embrace a life of rustic simplicity to cure her vocal ailments. The body of de Pompadour thus became a gendered battleground in which music-theoretical debate was indexed onto Enlightenment discourses on nature and luxury. </p>
