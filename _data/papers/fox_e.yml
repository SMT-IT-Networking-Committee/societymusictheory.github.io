abstract: |
  <p>The novel tonal scheme in the first movement of Chopin’s Piano Concerto in
  E minor, op. 11 (1830) presents an enigma for the analyst. As is well known,
  the subordinate theme in the solo exposition appears in the parallel mode of E
  major rather than the anticipated secondary key of G major, and the
  subordinate theme in the solo recapitulation unexpectedly arrives in G major
  rather than the tonic or parallel mode. This anomaly has intrigued critics
  since the concerto premiered, but its formal implications remain unclear.</p>
  <p>I propose that the subordinate themes in the solo exposition and solo
  recapitulation each contain locally disruptive digressions that counterbalance
  the inverted tonal scheme at the level of the movement. These interruptions
  exemplify the literary concept of the arabesque as outlined by Friedrich
  Schlegel in <i>Gespräch über die Poesie </i>(1800). John Daverio (1987, 1993)
  modified this idea for Romantic instrumental music, writing that the arabesque
  comprises “humorous, witty, or sentimental digressions that intentionally
  disturb the chronological flow of a narrative.” The function of the arabesque
  is to mask a logical process under the guise of chaos, and to empower
  listeners to decipher the procedure through wit.</p>
  <p>I use William Caplin’s theory of formal functions (1998) and Julian
  Horton’s work on virtuoso concerto form (2017) to demonstrate that Chopin’s
  tonal reversal is a large-scale expression of chaos, and that the lower level
  processes of the arabesque paradoxically reinstate order through disruption.
  The nested levels of conflict thus interrelate to conceal underlying tonal
  logic.</p>
