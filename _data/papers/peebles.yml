    <p>With its post-minimalist diatonicism, strong rhythmic pulse, and melodic repetition throughout all four movements, the surface of Shaw’s <em>Partita for 8 Voices</em> is quite accessible, but I argue that its general public acclaim results from various degrees of mimetic invitation within this composition, a perspective also explored by Fulton 2019. Drawing from Cox’s (2011) mimetic hypothesis, I illustrate how these degrees of mimetic imagery, most notability a work’s “singability” and “dancability,” correspond with the formal structure in the “Allemande” and “Passacaglia.” Further, I map the opposition of mimetic attenuation and invitation onto the ideas of individualism and community. Shaw’s use of intertextual references throughout this piece (Belcher 2019), especially those from American vernacular traditions eliciting communal participation, support this reading. This perspective casts the listener as an active agent in the creation of a musical community. As this represents a subjective, bodily way of knowing this music, it raises the important question: whose voice and body is represented in this analysis (Cusick 1994)? While I can experience a narrative of communal joy in this composition, others may experience a systematic oppression of the voice of the “other,” as sounds that I can’t imagine singing are exploited and exoticized (Davids 2019). Considering degrees of mimetic engagement and the way it shapes musical meaning as situated in the analyst, speaks to the wider concern of inclusivity in our field.</p>
