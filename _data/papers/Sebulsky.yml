    <p>Jambands do not stick to the script. Rather than base their live performances off of fixed studio recordings, they continually reimagine and recompose their songs through live-performance improvisation. Songs with no single version acting as <em>Urtext</em> are problematic for formal analysis; how can we describe a song's form if that form is constantly changing? Current methodologies for analyzing form in popular music treat the studio recording as the song’s basic form. However, this approach proves insufficient for the jamband repertoire, where studio recordings are, at best, snapshots of a particular performance and, at worst, nonexistent. </p>
    <p>In this paper, I offer new perspectives on jamband musical form. Using the music of the Dave Matthews Band as a case study, I analyze the formal fluidity present in their live-performance jamming—the combination of groove and improvisation. This methodology elicits three prototypes: jams that utilize a single groove as the accompaniment for improvisation, jams that contain multiple grooves, and jams that interpolate known pieces as new grooves. The Dave Matthews Band’s April 20, 2002 performance of their song “#41” demonstrates all three types within one, thirty-two-minute-long performance. </p>
    <p>When applied to multiple iterations of the same song, form-jam analyses demonstrate both synchronic (focused on a single performance) and diachronic (how one song has changed throughout multiple performances) perspectives. Concertgoers remember both previous live shows and studio albums. Their pre-conceived expectations will be both confirmed and denied with each new live show, a paradox that galvanizes the jamband sub-cultural community.</p>
