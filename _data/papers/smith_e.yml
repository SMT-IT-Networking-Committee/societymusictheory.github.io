title: "Middleground Prototypes for Mozart's First-Movement Concerto Forms"

abstract: |
    <p>Tonal theorists have neglected the concerto compared to most other
    formal genres. In this paper, I present exposition prototypes for Mozart’s
    major-mode concerto forms, analyzing the opening movements of K. 488 and
    K. 447 as examples. In doing so, I also suggest a solution to potential
    Kopfton contradictions arising from the “double-expositional” structure
    typical of concerto first movements.</p>
    <p>I propose a set of eight middleground exposition prototypes for
    Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) Type 5 sonata. These prototypes account for
    each combination of third- and fifth-progressions for P and one or two S
    themes. Since the opening ritornello (doubling as a first “exposition”)
    typically does not modulate, and since the recapitulation synthesizes
    material in the two expositions, Type 5 sonatas are replete with sites of
    potential conflict between third- and fifth-progressions. Some
    permutations do not cause any inherent problems, as demonstrated in an
    analysis of K. 488.</p>
    <p>However, the challenge of Kopfton contradiction arises in the
    combination of descending from 3^   in P and from 5^   in S. Rather than
    dismissing this possibility, I suggest a middleground “hybrid descent” (5
    ^  –4    ^  –3^  —3^  –2^  –1^  ) that can be interpreted from either
    Kopfton according to context, using K. 447 as an example. The hybrid
    allows for a nuanced interpretation of concerto movements with dialogue
    between  3^   and 5^  , providing a solution to one of many analytical
    challenges posed by the classical concerto and spearheading a new branch
    of scholarship on tonal analysis of concerto forms.</p>
