    <p>The temporalities of tonal and post-tonal music have often been characterized as radically different: notably, Jonathan Kramer (1988) contrasted “linear time” in tonal music with “vertical time” in some post-tonal musics. Whereas tonal (classical) music typically presents the standard paradigm of <em>beginning</em>, <em>middle</em>, and <em>end</em> (Agawu 1991), post-tonal music often presents as an <em>indefinitely extensible middle,</em> without beginning or end. Post-tonal music may also invoke various other temporal meanings such as <em>dilation</em> or <em>contraction</em> (e.g., Grisey’s “time of whales” and “time of birds or insects”; Hervé 2001), or <em>temporal polyphony</em> in which multiple temporalities are presented simultaneously (Rings 2008). These are examples of <em>temporal fictions</em>: emergent temporal meanings expressed by music, which may deviate significantly from the chronological time within which music is structured. </p>
    <p>But as this paper argues, many practices that contribute to the temporalities of post-tonal music are anticipated in earlier tonal practices. The difference is often simply one of degree: devices that tonal composers employ within the bounds of tonal forms may be expanded to entire pieces by post-tonal composers. In both tonality and <em>triadic post-tonality</em>, which employ similar harmonic units, interactions between <em>harmonic structure</em> and <em>temporal organization</em> are often crucial factors in the emergence of temporal fictions. This paper demonstrates how such interactions—manifested in the more specific categories of <em>harmonic direction</em>, <em>harmonic repetition</em>, <em>harmonic process</em>, and <em>harmonic rhythm</em>—contribute to temporal fictions in both tonal and post-tonal repertoires, focusing on Chopin’s Fourth Ballade as a striking example of continuity between tonal and post-tonal temporal fictions. </p>
