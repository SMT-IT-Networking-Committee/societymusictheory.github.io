abstract: |
    <p>In the burgeoning field of geometric music theory, scholars have
    explored ways of spatially representing voice leadings between chords. The
    <i>OPTIC</i> spaces provide a way to examine all “classes” of <i>n</i>-note
    chords formed under various types of equivalence: octave, permutational,
    transpositional, inversional, and cardinality. Although it is possible to map
    diatonic progressions in these spaces, they often appear irregular since the
    spaces are constructed with the fundamental unit of a mod-12 semitone, rather
    than a mod-7 diatonic step. Outside of geometric music theory, the properties
    of diatonic structure have been studied more broadly: Clough has established
    framework for describing diatonic structure analogous to that of Forte’s set
    theory; Hook provides a more generalized, “generic,” version of this work to
    describe any seven-note scale.  This paper employs these theories in order to
    explore the fundamental difference between mod-12 and mod-7 spaces: that is,
    whether the spaces are fundamentally discrete or continuous.</p>

    <p>After reviewing the construction of these voice-leading spaces, this
    paper will present the mod-7 <i>OPTIC-</i>,<i> OPTI</i>-, <i>OPT</i>-, and
    <i>OP</i>-spaces of 2- and 3-note chords. Although these spaces are
    fundamentally discrete, they can be imagined as lattice points within a
    continuous space. This construction reveals that the chromatic (mod-12)
    and generic (mod-7) voice-leading lattices both derive from the same
    topological space. In fact, although the discrete versions of these
    lattices appear to be quite different, the topological space underlying
    each of these graphs depends solely on the number of notes in the chords
    and the particular <i>OPTIC</i> relations applied.</p>
