abstract: |
  <p>Recent approaches in mathematical music theory have provided ways to
  describe voice leadings between various kinds of sonorities. Geometric theory
  has shown that the voice-leading space of seven-note scales within a chromatic
  (mod-12) universe shares the same structure as the voice-leading space of
  three-note chords within a diatonic (mod-7) universe (Tymoczko 2011). In
  transformational theory, the algebraic group of signature transformations
  (Hook 2008) conveys similar information about voice-leading relationships
  between scales; this paper presents the analogous transformational system for
  diatonic triads.</p>
  <p>The transformation group acts on a set of twenty-one objects: the seven
  diatonic triads differentiated by their three closed-position inversions.
  Application of the transformation <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> transforms the triad by ascending,
  single-step motion; repeated application of <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> generates the entire
  group, with cyclic group structure C<sub>21</sub>. The group can alternatively be
  generated by two different transformations: diatonic transposition (<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>)
  and triad rotation (<i>r</i><sub>1</sub>). This transformational system can be used to
  describe the motion of the upper three voices of a diatonic progression.
  Applying these transformations to a progression corresponds to transposing
  and/or changing the voicing of its upper voices.</p>
  <p>The group can be expanded to include open-position triads; however, all
  triads must be complete. Nonetheless, similar information about chord voicing
  in progressions containing incomplete triads and seventh chords can be
  captured by visualizing the progressions as paths through a mod-7
  <i>PT</i>-space. By treating these paths as objects in a transformational
  system, some transformations of the original system can be generalized as
  mathematical rotations and reflections in the geometric space.</p>
