abstract: |
  <p>There exists a mass pop music-making culture in the US, one in which
  millions of ordinary people participate every day.  This talk is not about
  musicians you already know.  It is about the throng of people who play pop
  music in relative anonymity.  It is about singing and playing, not necessarily
  about being heard.  According to a recent Gallup poll, fifty-eight percent of
  American households contain an active musician.  The quantity of sound pouring
  from these homes—the countless bedroom recitals, casual jams, practice
  sessions, picnic hootenannies, laptops remixes, and basement dance parties
  that occur regularly across the land—absolutely floods the trickle of music
  released by the official music industry.  Yet, the vast majority of pop music
  scholarship focuses on the relatively few musicians who have made commercial
  recordings, the musical one percent.</p>
  <p>This talk surveys some of the ways that amateur musicians shaped the sound
  and the business of pop music in the US from the mid-nineteenth century until
  today.  Sounds associated with amateurism repeatedly revitalized popular
  music.  When the profit motive or a fetish for virtuosity infected
  professionals, from Liszt to Styx, amateurs—be they parlor pianists or
  punks—were celebrated for the antidote of their shaggy, heartfelt
  performances.  At the same time, the pop music industry developed strategies
  of monetizing amateur investments of money, time, and labor. The industry sold
  dreams of success through amateur shows from <i>The Major Bowes Original
  Amateur Hour</i> in the thirties to <i>American Idol</i>, even as it saved the
  cost of paying professional wages to its on-air talent.  And the massive
  supply of aspiring amateurs kept the cost of talent for record labels or
  concert venues so low that artists who landed these gigs often did not earn
  enough to transcend amateurism in any economic sense.  </p>
  <p>The history of US pop music appears very different when viewed from the
  perspective of amateurs instead of pros.  It is not about genius, originality,
  virtuosity, or fame.  It is about the cacophony produced by the throng of
  people who play pop music in relative anonymity.  </p>
