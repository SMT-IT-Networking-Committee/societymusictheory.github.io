  <p>At the dramatic fulcrum of Strauss’s 1911 <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i>, the
  young lover, Count Octavian, appears dressed in luminous costume to present a
  silver rose to the ingenue Sophie. The Presentation of the Rose is in many
  respects the emblematic moment of the opera: the central event around which
  the plot revolves, and a musical episode that is sonically presaged and
  recalled in every act. The Presentation is, above all, a timbral moment: more
  distinctive even than its famous oboe theme is its lustrous orchestral
  palette, gilded with high bells and strings. While some music scholars have
  lately turned their attention to the aesthetic, technological, and
  philosophical questions presented by timbre, the timbral effects in
  <i>Rosenkavalier</i> invite reference to related work across the humanities on
  the history of shine and glamour within visual culture, by scholars like Anne
  Cheng, Krista Thompson, and Joseph Roach. These scholars have explored the
  ways in which the aesthetic of shine is historically bound up with racialized
  and gendered imagery of exotic skin and enticing surfaces.</p>
  <p>With this in mind, music scholars might be newly sensitive to several
  ostensibly peripheral details that accompany the striking sonic shimmer of
  <i>Rosenkavalier</i>. The silver rose, carried in a Moroccan case and scented
  with Persian oil, is conveyed by Mohammed, the Marschallin’s silent black
  slave boy, who appears in the drama only once more: at the close of the entire
  opera, accompanied by diminutive bells, a variant on the exoticist trope of
  Turkish triangle. Mohammed, frequently performed in blackface, has presented a
  problem for recent productions of <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> that struggle to
  reconcile love for its conspicuous sonic beauty with an inexcisable political
  taboo. This paper argues that though vocally silent, Mohammed is a timbrally
  overwhelming figure: his little bells are historically the wellspring and
  contraction of the timbral shine which in the Presentation marks romantic
  desire between white characters exchanging an exoticist artifact. He therefore
  points towards a wider racial history of musical timbre, visible in particular
  ways at Stauss’s modernist moment—a history with unsettling implications for
  western conceptions of musical beauty.</p>
