    <p>This paper analyses a particular epistemic injustice focusing on the experience of deaf music knowers. One narrow folk definition of what a deaf person <em>is </em>reinforces common stereotypes about deaf people and our ability to access music. This definition assumes that all deaf persons hear no sound at all and are therefore unable to access, experience, appreciate or develop informed views about music. Academics are not exempt from this kind of thinking, as I recently experienced when giving a paper offering a view of how the field of Deaf Philosophy might approach the topic of music appreciation. My paper aims at the messy middle of signing deaf community reality – deaf people can and do appreciate music, with or without sound. During the discussion portion of my paper, I was dismissed as a knower of music and also as a knower of deafness. Ironically, these two epistemic challenges turned on the same criterion – whether I had the capacity to experience sound. My challenger's reasoning was as follows: to count as a knower of music, one must possess the capacity to hear; to count as a knower of deafness, one must not possess any auditory capacity. Fricker's own descriptions of epistemic injustice refer to the parties in such an interaction as 'speaker' and 'hearer', reinforcing a conception of epistemic injustice that is audist by default. I argue for a Deaf Philosophy approach, which assumes the validity of signing Deaf community testimony as a starting point instead of using an audiogram as gatekeeper.</p>
