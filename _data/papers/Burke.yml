abstract: | 
    <p>This paper analyses a particular epistemic injustice focusing on the experience of deaf music knowers. One narrow folk definition of what a deaf person <em>is </em>reinforces common stereotypes about deaf people and our ability to access music. This definition assumes that all deaf persons hear no sound at all and are therefore unable to access, experience, appreciate or develop informed views about music. Academics are not exempt from this kind of thinking, as I recently experienced when giving a paper offering a view of how the field of Deaf Philosophy might approach the topic of music appreciation. My paper aims at the messy middle of signing deaf community reality – deaf people can and do appreciate music, with or without sound. During the discussion portion of my paper, I was dismissed as a knower of music and also as a knower of deafness. Ironically, these two epistemic challenges turned on the same criterion – whether I had the capacity to experience sound. My challenger's reasoning was as follows: to count as a knower of music, one must possess the capacity to hear; to count as a knower of deafness, one must not possess any auditory capacity. Fricker's own descriptions of epistemic injustice refer to the parties in such an interaction as 'speaker' and 'hearer', reinforcing a conception of epistemic injustice that is audist by default. I argue for a Deaf Philosophy approach, which assumes the validity of signing Deaf community testimony as a starting point instead of using an audiogram as gatekeeper.</p>
    <p>‘<strong>We like no noise, unless we make it ourselves’: Music Theory’s (Insidious) Norms</strong></p>
    <p>Richard Beaudoin (Dartmouth College)</p>
    <p>The field of music theory operates according to countless unwritten, unspoken agreements that quietly regulate its content. These insidious norms have historically funneled scholarly activity towards notated scores by white, male, able-bodied persons. Redirecting these currents, writings by William Cheng, Philip Ewell, Ellie Hisama, and Loren Kajikawa suggest that music departments would be more interesting, healthy, and populated places if all music — and all theorists — counted. This is not simply a platitude: an ongoing curricular transformation will be offered as a case study of the impact that these scholars have had on the creation of new courses and avenues of research.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the proposals set forth in Hisama’s “Getting to Count,” I will raise questions about theory’s entrenched center/periphery binary: Which works are granted ‘citizenship’ at our conferences? Which performers receive analytical attention? Which interpreters are ‘allowed’ to record which repertoire? And within audio recordings, which sounds matter? This last question might seem trivial, but it is teeming with hermeneutic life: our collective appraisal about what ‘counts’ as music — and who does the counting — reinforces an undue sanctity for the composer’s score as determinative of meaningful content while simultaneously marginalizing the sounds made by the bodies of performers. (This includes the common and disturbing practice of suppressing the sound of musicians breathing.) New research that analyzes and celebrates the totality of sounding bodies is offered as a small contribution to the larger epistemic changes occurring within music departments and the SMT.</p>
