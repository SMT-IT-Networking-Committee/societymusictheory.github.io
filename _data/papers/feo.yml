abstract: |
  <p>In Paris during the <i>fin de siècle</i>, on one or two nights of the year,
  approximately 6,000 finely-dressed audience members could be found in
  attendance at a special benefit concert. A chandelier glittered above, and the
  programs often featured famous guest artists. The venue, however, was not one
  of the highly-esteemed musical institutions of the city. It was the Bon
  Marché, Paris’s premiere luxury department store.</p> 
  <p>In Michael B. Miller’s work with the Bon Marché archives, he provides
  an in-depth study of the history of the store. In particular, he
  elucidates how its paternalistic model cultivated a sense of employee
  loyalty to the organization, while also enrolling employees into bourgeois
  values of respectability. In her book <i>Composing the Citizen</i>, Jann
  Pasler introduced the Bon Marché archival materials to musicological
  study. Her work focuses on documents such as concert programs, images,
  handbooks, and more, as she explores the employee instrumental and choral
  program. Pasler examines this program as a function of French national
  edification efforts, which sought to develop the knowledge and tastes of
  the working classes and thereby elevate their social and cultural
  practices to align with middle-class values.</p> 
  <p>In my paper, I bring the Bon Marché music program into the discourse of
  spatial theory by examining the store concert venue as a site of supposed
  social mobility, thereby building upon Miller and Pasler’s work by
  introducing new questions about the social and governmental aims of the
  store and its programs. I draw from Michel de Certeau’s conceptualization
  of the “fragmented” city and Henri Lefebvre’s model of his ideal unified
  city, positing that the store is formulated as belonging to the latter.
  Specifically, I show that de Certeau’s idea of subversive “tactic” versus
  dominant “strategy” is complicated by the Bon Marché’s music program,
  which functions as both. I contrast the store concerts with the cabarets
  of Montmartre, which I demonstrate to be fragmented, tactical sites, even
  as they remain the realm of the lower classes. In doing so, I argue that
  the conception of Paris as a unified city promises social mobility, but
  spaces of performance reveal the more textured reality of cultural
  practice acting as “strategy” cloaked in the guise of opportunity.</p>
