abstract: |
  <p>By the end of the nineteenth century, Paris was established as the
  cosmopolitan center of Europe, boasting a rich musical landscape. Audiences had
  an abundance of concert venues to choose from, ranging in options as diverse as
  the Opéra or the cabarets of Montmartre. Among the most curious of these venues
  was one that has received almost no attention in scholarship: the Bon Marché
  department store. This luxury establishment, founded in the mid-nineteenth
  century, was transformed into the site of a lavish spectacle on winter nights,
  and the featured performers were the very same salespeople who worked at the
  store by day. In the summer, these employees provided musical entertainment in
  outdoor concerts in a nearby square. These indoor and outdoor concerts were the
  result of music lessons provided by an award-winning employee program
  established by the store’s visionary owners, Aristide and Marguerite Boucicaut,
  who believed in the merits of cultivating the tastes and skills of the members
  of their corporate community. Such sentiments reflected the aims of the Third
  Republic’s national project of “creating the citizen,” which sought to educate
  and elevate people across class lines for the benefit of the nation. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I situate the Bon Marché performance series within the
  context of this greater national project. In many ways, the ensemble was
  similar to the working-class <i>harmonies</i> that gathered to perform in the
  tradition of military bands in kiosks across France. The Bon Marché is unique,
  however, in that it also offered an indoor counterpart that catered to élite
  audiences, where store employees sang alongside guest artists from the Opéra.
  Drawing from original research conducted in the archives of the Bon Marché, I
  bring to light a forgotten contribution to the French musical landscape.
  Furthermore, as I examine accounts of the performances, I engage with current
  scholarship on reception practices to elucidate <i>fin-de-siècle</i> rituals of
  outdoor and indoor venues, linking them to issues of space, class, and consumer
  culture in a rapidly shifting Paris. </p>
