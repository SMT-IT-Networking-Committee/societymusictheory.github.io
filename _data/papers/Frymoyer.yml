    <p>This paper, drawn from a larger study of applications of topic theory in modernist music, explores how techniques of partitioning, variants, and combinatoriality support waltz topics in Schoenberg’s twelve-tone music. Interestingly, despite very different row structures across the works examined here (Op. 26, Op. 29, and Op. 30), Schoenberg repeatedly uses partitions that support stock features of the waltz topic such as fourth or fifth relationships for bassline downbeats (“oom”), unordered invariant harmonies for repeated “pah-pah” chords on beats two and three, and half or whole steps for sighing figures. These pitch and harmonic features are not aberrant, but rather conform to invariant relationships and partitioning strategies identified in studies by Haimo (1990), Mead (1985), and Boss (2014). Topical identity therefore emerges from, rather than violates, a work’s established twelve-tone strategies. Moreover, the waltz topic often coincides with important moments in the formal structure or signals the appearance of novel partitioning strategies. Contrary to readings that interpret Schoenberg’s topical gesture through autobiographical or programmatic narratives and/or identify such gestures as ironic or distorted, I conclude that Schoenberg used topics to enhance the clarity and accessibility of twelve-tone procedures. In effect, topics make the work’s twelve-tone structure “audible” and, one might even say, <em>embodied</em> through the use of dance gesture. In this regard, the use of topics aptly fulfills Schoenberg’s own imperative to use the twelve-tone method in service of “the same kind of form or expression, the same themes, melodies, sounds, rhythms as you used before” (Schoenberg 1984, 213).</p>
