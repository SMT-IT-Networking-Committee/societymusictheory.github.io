title: "Can a Leaf Make Music? Techniques and Aesthetics of Plant-Generated CV
in Electronic Music"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Research has revealed that plants are more electrically active than
    previously thought, producing and transmitting both action potential (AP)
    and variation potential (VP) through their tissues. Seeking to harness
    this novel source of electrical activity, composers, improvisers, and
    commercial companies have constructed innovative devices that convert
    biological electrical signaling into MIDI control codes or control voltage
    (CV). In this way, plants can trigger or modify sounds in an electronic
    synthesizer or computer.</p>
    <p>Our project has two branches. First, we investigate the question of how
    and why plants produce and transmit electrical signals, based on a large
    and growing corpus of research in the biological sciences. We provide a
    novel catalog of how various species of common plants generate AP/VP under
    different environmental conditions.</p>
    <p>Second, we interrogate aesthetic questions around human responses to
    plant-structured music. Much of this music shares common stylistic
    characteristics. We situate the practice in a broader cultural landscape.
    What is it, to compose or improvise music with non-human collaborators?
    How does our bias—reflected in plants’ “othering” in taxonomic systems
    dating back to Aristotle and Linnaeus—influence our response? How can
    human communities create music together by interacting with the
    environment?</p>
    <p>Our work on these problems has resulted in several profitable and
    successful collaborations between our team and colleagues in the STEM
    fields at our respective universities. The poster session includes a live
    demonstration of “plant music,” using three modular synthesizers and
    several species of plants. We invite you to come by and interact with the
    greenery!</p>
