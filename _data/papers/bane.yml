  <p>Although recent scholarship in a variety of fields has significantly
  advanced our understanding of early modern civility and music’s role within
  it, the relation between music and civility in France during the first three
  decades of the seventeenth century remains ambiguous. In this paper, I propose
  to survey the relevant sources and show how a new approach to musical civility
  developed in France at this time in response to changing social structures at
  court. Before 1630, theorists of French civility generally repeated the advice
  of earlier, and especially Italian, traditions. Many assimilated the work of
  Baldassare Castiglione, who located the primary function of music in its
  ability to productively relax the mind and body, while others emphasized
  music’s role in exercise and physical discipline. In 1630, however, Nicolas
  Faret articulated a new and influential motivation in his treatise
  <i>L’honneste-homme, ou l’art du plaire à la court</i>, one of the first and
  most important contributions to the French strain of civility known as
  <i>honnêteté</i>. Instead of providing pleasurable leisure or profitable
  exercise, music-making became one piece of a broader “art of pleasing” aimed
  at gratifying social or economic superiors. Faret, I argue, translated the
  humanist ethos of self-betterment described by Castiglione and other Italian
  authors into a bourgeois ethos of social advancement better suited to the
  needs of courtiers and other attendants at the rapidly centralizing court of
  Louis XIII. Faret’s popular work shaped behavior in France for much of the
  century and helped to define the role of the arts in <i>honnêteté</i> in the
  decades preceding the publication of the Chevalier de Méré’s essays in the
  1670s and 80s. As such, this paper will reveal Faret’s treatise to also mark
  an important development in the twinned histories of music and civility in
  late-Renaissance France.</p>
