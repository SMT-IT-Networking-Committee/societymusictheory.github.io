    <p>Augustine-Julie Leduc (née Bernier) lost her husband in 1823 and assumed
    ownership of his Parisian publishing firm. In the first years of Leduc’s
    editorship, the Opéra-Comique was phasing out Grétry’s classic <i>Richard
    Cœur-de-lion.</i> The opera went from ten performances in 1823 and 1824 to
    merely two in 1825, 1826, and 1827. Nevertheless, Leduc published a
    piano-vocal arrangement by Louis Maresse. A decade and regime change later, in
    1840, Marie-Pierre Launer (née Boissière) inherited her late husband’s
    company. Within Launer’s first year, the Opéra-Comique revived <i>Richard
    </i>to an acclaim the work had not received in half a century. Launer released
    the same Maresse arrangement within a month of the Opéra-Comique’s instantly
    popular revival. Against the backdrop of this one score, I explore how Leduc
    and Launer used the technologies of their printing houses to engage with and
    maneuver through their respective musical environments.</p>
    <p>Launer’s 1841 publication of <i>Richard</i> looks almost identical to
    Leduc’s print in 1826. Both editors used lithography and octavo formats.
    Furthermore, Launer had her assistant, Mademoiselle Damours, re-engrave every
    page of Leduc’s plates, matching every system break. Difference emerges not
    from the paper, but in how audiences interacted with the domestic arrangement.
    In 1841, the Opéra-Comique had revived Grétry’s <i>Richard </i>with a
    dramatically re-written orchestration. Thus, Launer’s public-domain version of
    <i>Richard</i> contrasted the contemporary revival. In her catalogue, Launer
    claimed her firm’s small octavo format was “very convenient for following
    along in the theater.” Connoisseurs, who had not heard <i>Richard</i> in full
    since 1827, could develop new knowledge about the Opéra-Comique’s production
    through the past version the piano-vocal arrangement mediated.</p>
    <p>Sociologist Wiebe Bikjer proposes a non-linear model of technological
    development, one which accounts for how social groups’ various interests pull
    an artifact in different directions during the course of its development.
    Bikjer demonstrates this model through the history of the bicycle. I propose
    turning Bikjer’s model inside out. Instead of tracing the various forms a
    material artifact took before its final stabilization, as Bikjer does with the
    bicycle, I trace how nearly the same material artifact was used to reinterpret
    information over time. In 1826, the Opéra-Comique had not advertised their
    revival as something modern, and audiences understood Leduc’s piano-vocal
    arrangement as an artifact directly related to the Opéra-Comique’s current
    production. Yet in 1841, a re-engraving of those same plates became material
    evidence that modern musicians, as well as spectators clamoring for the
    theater’s update, disrespected the “great masters.” Under new musical and
    aesthetic conditions, the same technology, a portable and accessible octavo
    score, equipped a new social group to develop progressive ideas of the
    operatic work concept.</p>
