    <p>Postcolonial critics have noted the homogenizing effect cultural distance can have as intracultural differences are downplayed to emphasize perceived essences. Scholars of non-Western music often assimilate the ideas of various theorists to construct a seemingly impersonal system that can serve as an “emic” analytic tool. For example, modern writers might posit an ancient and unified Chinese tuning system, based on a standard pitch and generated using alternating ratios of 2:3 and 4:3. This is not wrong, but such coherence was hardly the experience of the theorists they draw on, who struggled to situate themselves within a bewildering array of competing systems. For them, such commonalities were too obvious or fundamental to require much comment, and they might have seen only contradictions that resist elision.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I translate and analyze a passage by Northern Song scholar, Chen Yang, from his magisterial <em>Book of Music</em> (1101). In the introduction to a section on tuning, he briefly surveys the work of eleven theorists spanning eight centuries, concentrating on how their approaches cannot be reconciled. Chen omits anyone from the preceding 450 years, implying it is not simply the trope of Tang decadence, but instead that the figures of the distant past themselves did not describe a singular theory, but rather a set of variations on a theme. We collapse these variations at the risk of greatly simplifying the intellectual milieu and decontextualizing the innovations of later theorists, who were not so much stepping beyond classical precedent as participating in a longstanding conversation.</p>
