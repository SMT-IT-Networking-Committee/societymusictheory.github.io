    <p>Most pre-Franconian works deal with semibreves ambiguously despite their stress on longs and breves, although two forms of semibreves, the minor and the major, were proposed by Lambertus (c. 1270) and disseminated by Franco of Cologne (c. 1280). However, this does not mean that pre-Franconian theory ignores semibreves; it instead tends to explain this note value without explicitly using the term “semibreve.” This presentation therefore aims at clarifying concepts and functions of these “connoted” semibreves in pre-Franconian treatises.</p>
    <p>Connoted semibreves are found mainly in two forms: <em>opposita proprietas</em> and the “reduction to a three-note ligature.” Johannes de Garlandia (c. 1260) defines that within a ligature of <em>opposita proprietas,</em> regardless of how many preceding notes are juxtaposed before a long, the whole length of them is equivalent to one breve. Here, the preceding notes imply semibreves. Additionally, several pre-Franconian treatises, including Garlandia and Anonymous VII (c. 1270), observe the rule of the reduction to a three-note ligature. Particularly according to Garlandia, the length of the preceding notes––except the penultimate and ultimate notes––in a more-than-three-note ligature corresponds to the first note in a three-note ligature, namely, a long. Here again, the preceding notes can be breves or semibreves. In both principles, the connoted semibreves have flexibility in that their duration is changeable according to the number of preceding notes within a ligature. I also argue that this flexibility might have been inherited by Petronian notation (after 1280), in which three and more semibreves are placed for one breve.</p>
