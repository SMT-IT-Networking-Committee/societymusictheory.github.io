abstract: |
  <p>Eighteenth-century France is often associated with illumination. This is no
  doubt reflected in the epistemological undercurrent of the time: nearly every
  discipline tried to both understand and legitimize itself through observation
  and examination. Nowhere is this ideation more prominent than in two seemingly
  disparate disciplines—anatomy and music theory. Anatomy experienced a
  veritable explosion of somatic inquiry, dissecting and studying the human body
  in new and exciting ways; likewise, music theory witnessed equally provocative
  developments in the realms of harmony, establishing for the first time a
  reified principle of chordal identity. Perhaps these explorations are
  unrelated; perhaps not. These discrete disciplines followed a common
  epistemological thread. Within this century of discovery, nothing could be
  left concealed for long.</p>
  <p>This paper thus investigates the role of uncovering in contemporaneous
  anatomy and music theory, especially within discussions of nerves and the
  nervous system, “les organes des sensations” according to the
  <i>Encyclopédie</i>. In particular, I examine Michel-Paul Guy de Chabanon’s
  writings on musical phenomenology in relation to Jean-Philippe Rameau’s theory
  of harmony and early modern anatomical thought. As I show, both Chabanon and
  Rameau rely on nervous system metaphors to contextualize their comments on
  auditory perception. But what is important is how these references are not
  strictly analogical; on the contrary, Chabanon and Rameau use such
  physiological conceptions to substantiate their ideas on musical expression. I
  ultimately argue that we can only reconcile such metaphors when they are
  placed within and against early modernity’s preoccupation with listening to
  the hidden, interior body. </p>
