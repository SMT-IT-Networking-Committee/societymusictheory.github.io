    <p>A decisive feature of modernity in the temporal arts—in music in particular—might be seen in the challenge, suspension, or even abolition of conventional temporal functions. Such modernist concepts of suspended temporality (“non-linear time”), however, remain multiply cross-related to conventional concepts and qualities of time (“linear time,” Kramer 1988, 20–65). This is exemplified by Salvatore Sciarrinoʼs creative method which reconciles more conventional elements of discursive organicist design (processes of accumulation, multiplication, and transformation) with strategies of rupture and formal deterioriation (“little bang,” “window form”). This unique mixing of “linear” and “non-linear” strategies is staged in a soundscape of mostly very low dynamics and reduced activity at the edge of silence, sensitizing the listener for minimal changes.</p>
    <p>This paper introduces key strategies in Sciarrino’s temporal form based on analytical investigations into various genres. Based on context- and perception sensitive analytical tools such as morphosyntactic musical analysis (Utz 2016), imprints and prototypes (Deliège 2001), and formal association and categorization (Hanninen 2004), this corpus analysis forms the background of a discussion of relationship between beginnings and endings in relation to constellations of duration and density. While beginnings might be marked by unconventional topoi such as “in <em>medias res</em>,” they frequently establish an almost imperceptible sonic ground. Endings, by contrast, are often marked by irregularities and signify impasses that prevent any further musical development. Such markedness emphasizing difference, open questions, and unresolved conflicts, make these beginnings and endings keys to an understanding of the composer’s unique staging of reflexive musical form.</p>
