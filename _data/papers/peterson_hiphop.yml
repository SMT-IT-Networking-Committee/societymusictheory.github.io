abstract: |
    <p>As a counterpart to academic studies of hip hop, active performance of hip
    hop styles allows students and instructors alike to engage deeply with the
    sounds of hip hop music. In 2016, I founded the University of Oregon Hip Hop
    Ensemble, a for-credit ensemble of MCs, rhythm section, and horns. In
    arranging classic songs for performance by a band, instrumentalists must pay
    close attention to sonic elements of the instrumental track (timbres,
    arrangement), and MCs must give attention to elements of flow like rhythmic
    patterning, styles of emphasis, and pronunciation. Students learn hip hop by
    making hip hop.</p>
