abstract: | 
    <p>Momma Rose, the lead character in <em>Gypsy</em> (Styne and Sondheim 1959), was a manipulative stage mother and a larger-than-life character whose destructive personality could not be constrained by prevailing music-theatrical conventions for foursquare hypermeter and regular sentential phrase lengths. Her songs employ extraordinary and sometimes novel phrase expansions, and the repetitiveness of those extensions often reflect her obsessiveness. My talk will principally focus on Rose’s problems with (musical) boundaries in “Everything’s Coming Up Roses,” and will also explore portions of two of her other songs: “Some People” and “Rose’s Turn.”</p>
