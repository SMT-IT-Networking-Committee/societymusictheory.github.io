abstract: |
    <p>Lusty songs, as opposed to love songs, are relatively rare in musical theater. When they occur, they’re usually metaphorically valanced—and they’re funny. This brief talk examines three songs, ostensibly <em>not</em> about sex, where the music, stage direction, and lyrical double entendres clarify the actual topic: “Sign Here” from <em>Flora, The Red Menace</em> (Kander and Ebb, 1965), “Baptize Me” from <em>Book of Mormon</em> (Stone, Parker, and Lopez, 2011), and “Jerry Likes My Corn” from <em>Grey Gardens</em> (Frankel and Wright, 2006).</p>
    <p>Each song employs a different compositional and lyrical strategy to let us know that signing up for the Communist Party, getting baptized, and the way an old lady “does” her canned corn are not the real matters at hand in these not-so-demure theatrical songs about sex (by any other name).</p>
