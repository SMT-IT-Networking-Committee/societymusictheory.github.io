abstract: |
    <p>Lusty songs, as opposed to love songs, are relatively rare in musical theater. When they occur, they’re usually metaphorically valanced—and they’re funny. This brief talk examines three songs, ostensibly <em>not</em> about sex, where the music, stage direction, and lyrical double entendres clarify the actual topic: “Sign Here” from <em>Flora, The Red Menace</em> (Kander and Ebb, 1965), “Baptize Me” from <em>Book of Mormon</em> (Stone, Parker, and Lopez, 2011), and “Jerry Likes My Corn” from <em>Grey Gardens</em> (Frankel and Wright, 2006).</p>
