    <p>The 19th century was a time for formal innovation. As recent
    scholarship contends, what once would have been deformational quickly
    became normative, pushing composers to experiment further. Though the bulk
    of Hensel’s compositions are songs and short piano pieces, her few larger
    works demonstrate progressive techniques that align with current
    explorations of Romantic-era form studies. In this presentation, I look at
    how the open-ended secondary theme in the first movement of Hensel’s Piano
    Trio affects significant structural moments and how this impacts the
    traditional sonata narrative. In effect, I show how this theme, along with
    its cyclic return in the finale, culminates to provide both thematic and
    structural closure in the Piano Trio’s deployment of sonata form.</p>
    <p>The first movement departs from the second theme, unresolved by moving
    immediately to contrasting material in the parallel minor, leaving the EEC
    and ESC to be achieved by a third theme. The finale’s secondary theme
    likewise struggles to find resolution, recalling the primary theme to
    achieve the EEC. We hear familiar material prior to the recapitulation’s
    structural close: the unresolved secondary theme from the first movement.
    The restatement of this material at the conclusion of the fourth movement
    highlights a cyclic return, and establishes a contrasting narrative to
    Hensel’s other sonata movements.</p>
    <p>Further analysis on Hensel’s works may explore other hallmarks of early
    19th-century formal construction, providing both a path for future
    examination of idiosyncratic formal constructs and an expansion of current
    discussion of Fanny Hensel’s catalogue.</p>
