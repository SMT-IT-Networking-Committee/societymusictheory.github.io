abstract: |
  <p>Tomás Luis de Victoria occupied divergent worlds. Most of his formal
  education and career occurred in Rome, while he spent his later years at the
  Descalzas Reales convent in Madrid. He served as chaplain to the Empress María
  of Austria and became convent organist after her death. While his choice to
  work at a small royal convent might seem peculiar, this position placed him at
  the center of court activity. Early scholars tended to underestimate his
  financial success; however, reexamination of the biographical narrative
  reveals Victoria’s association with the most prominent nobility, clergy, and
  businessmen of the period, relationships that certainly boosted his reputation
  and financial status. The dedicatees of Victoria’s publications are evidence
  of this, as are his long-term associations with the most respected music
  publishing firms of the period.</p>
  <p>Victoria’s first Spanish publication, <i>Missae, Magnificat, Motecta,
  Psalmi, & alia .</i> . . (1600), was dedicated to Philip III and printed by
  the royal press. It includes an unprecedented number of polychoral works with
  organ accompaniment, foreshadowing the “colossal” Baroque style. Some scholars
  interpret this as a stylistic shift intended only to indulge the frivolous
  tastes of a young king, but I posit an alternative view: the repertoire is
  suitable for the most prominent feasts of the church year, and the
  circumstances surrounding its publication offer unique insight into Victoria’s
  business practices and reveal his pragmatic nature. An updated reading of
  sources related to the collection emphasizes Victoria’s prowess at
  self-promotion and his acute ability to recognize the tastes of his intended
  audiences and tailor publications to meet the demand. Letters sent alongside
  his prints demonstrate his careful consideration of potential customers, as
  does the printing contract drawn up between Victoria and the Imprenta
  Real.</p>
