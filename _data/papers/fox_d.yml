title: "Does It Matter Which Room Alvin Lucier Sits in?"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Although Alvin Lucier’s <i>I Am Sitting in a Room</i> (1969) continues to
  be a central point of reference for discussion about the material conditions
  of sound in music, little attention has been given to the changing conditions
  of production of the work. Its recursive process of recording and playing-back
  continues to transform the composer’s speaking voice into a music of
  architectural resonances. But which architectural resonances? The original
  recording was made in the composer’s living room and a “performance” consisted
  of playing-back that spliced magnetic tape in concert halls and galleries.
  Then, in 2005, Lucier began collaborating with James Fei on digitally mediated
  performances that resonate the architecture of the public performance space in
  real time. </p>
  <p>This paper describes the crucial role of the sound-engineer-as-performer in
  emplacing living-room aesthetics into the concert hall. It traces the changing
  material and performative conditions of this work using the Alvin Lucier
  Papers at the New York Public Library and my interviews with sound engineers
  that have performed the work. </p>
  <p><i>I Am Sitting in a Room</i> participates in diverging scholarly projects,
  including investigations of sonic materiality, listening-as-performance, and
  audio-signal compression. But the literature downplays the drastic changes in
  its ontology and the implications for these projects. </p>
  <p>There persists in the literature an overemphasis on non-intervention—of the
  room sounding itself. But closer investigation reveals significant variation
  in performative interventions and the resulting sounds. In a performance at
  Issue Project Room with sound engineer Bob Bellerue (2017), a few stable sine
  tones rapidly overpowered Lucier’s speech and grew to an ear-piercing volume.
  In contrast, in the MoMA recording (2014) the speech dissolves gradually into
  the room resonance and, as Fei describes, there arises “a cluster of tones
  [that] mutate—they still go-away and come-in—and sometimes they start beating
  with another tone.” Revealing subtleties of architectural resonances through a
  gradual process may have been immanent in Lucier’s living room in 1970, but in
  current live performance practice sound engineers often need to continually
  intervene through volume and EQ levels if they want to tether the subtlety of
  living room aesthetics to performance hall acoustics. </p>
