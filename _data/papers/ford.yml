  <p>The late 1960s saw the emergence of jazz fusion, a genre that blended
  elements from not only jazz and rock, but also funk. From this last genre,
  fusion drew rhythmic elements, such as adding an emphasis on the first beat to
  the two-and-four backbeat heard in jazz and rock; riff-like bass lines; and,
  significantly, the addition of synthesizers to the instrumental line-up.
  However, these instruments, sold by Moog, ARP, etc., were still developing in
  terms of sophistication. Two particular issues that hindered streamlined
  performances were the initial lack of capacity to save patch configurations
  and, until the introduction of MIDI in 1981, the inability of synthesizers of
  different brands to be connected efficiently. This led to indeterminate
  settings in which musicians and engineers were forced to create patches on the
  fly, not being sure what the sonic results of their configurations will be
  until the notes were struck. However, despite the indeterminate settings both
  on- and offstage, engaging with technologies such as electric pianos,
  synthesizers, and multi-tracking have often been construed as antithetical to
  improvisation in jazz journalism and scholarship.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that the uncertainty of manipulating, combining, and
  recombining early synthesizers generated a form of improvisational lutherie.
  Understanding improvisation as comprising indeterminacy, analysis of
  conditions, agency, and choice (Lewis 2016), it can be both an “in the moment”
  practice as well as a process that can take place over longer periods of time.
  I demonstrate how Herbie Hancock and his sound engineers Pat Gleeson, Keith
  Lofstrom, and Bryan Bell improvised instrument-building both on-stage and
  off-stage, in their continual acquisition and exploration of electronic
  instruments and the sonic possibilities of their combinations during the
  1970s. </p>
  <p>While these indeterminate conditions of constructing and combining
  electronic instruments have been noted in recent scholarship (Pond, 2005;
  Fellezs 2011; Gluck 2013), such forms of lutherie have not been understood as
  improvisational. This paper adds not only to the slowly growing discourse on
  jazz fusion, a genre that has been historically neglected in jazz scholarship,
  but also to electric organology and the study of the early development of
  synthesizers.</p>
