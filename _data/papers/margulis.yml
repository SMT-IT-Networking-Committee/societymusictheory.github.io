    <p>The description “highly musical” can be applied to entities as various
    as people, analyses, compositions, and performances. But what exactly does
    it mean for one performance or analysis to be more musical than another?
    By systematically interrogating the use of this term in various contexts,
    this paper seeks to reveal covert cultural attitudes and intuitions about
    music.</p>

    <p>First, the paper examines cases where a theorist characterizes an
    analysis as especially “musical.” In analytic contexts, the descriptive
    “musical” is often set in opposition to the descriptive “theoretical,”
    reflecting an awareness of the way music’s most compelling aspects can
    elude capture by prevailing analytic systems, and a continuing effort to
    listen beyond these systems and develop new tools that are responsive to
    the unique aspects of individual works.</p>

    <p>Second, the paper examines cases where performances are described as
    particularly musical. In both characterizations of analysis and in
    characterizations of performance, the term musical is asked to carry the
    residue after existing modes of understanding are exhausted.</p>

    <p>Third, the paper examines a number of studies where people rated the
    musicality of sound sequences, ranging from collections of pitches to
    utterances normally thought of as speech.</p>

    <p>The final section of the paper asks whether the relationship between
    theory and the musical is necessarily one of pursuit and elusiveness, or
    whether other models might exist. For example, is it possible to develop
    theories and analyses that more directly target the musical without
    pushing our notion of the musical further away?</p>
