    <p>Music theory offers multiple accounts of the relationship between sound and
    narrative in instrumental music. We developed and validated a Narrative
    Engagement Scale that measures the extent to which an individual hears an
    excerpt narratively. We administered it to participants at two US sites and a
    rural village in China (Dimen) after listening to each of a set of Western and
    Chinese instrumental excerpts. Participants also provided descriptions of
    imagined stories. Critically, participants at US sites lacked experience with
    Chinese-language media, and participants in Dimen lacked experience with
    English-language media, an important locus for the generation of
    sound-referent associations.</p>
    <p>Participants at all sites narrativized frequently and reported it as
    enjoyable. We compared narrative responses to each of the 128 excerpts.
    Participants at US sites tended to respond narratively to the same excerpts;
    Dimen participants responded narratively to an entirely different set.
    Culturally specific patterns of sound associations shaped narrativity more
    than any structural factors within the music itself.</p> 
    <p>Striking consensus characterized the within-culture free response
    descriptions, with equally striking divergences characterizing between-culture
    responses. For example, an excerpt heard by participants at the US sites to
    depict “murder” and “paranoia” was understood by participants in Dimen to
    depict happy trips into the mountains with friends. Particular structural
    features thus seemed to influence associations within- but not
    cross-culturally. Further studies reinforced this observation by manipulating
    individual structural features, and by using a matching paradigm to probe
    associations. We conclude with the beginnings of a new theory about how
    narrative experiences arise.</p>
