abstract: |
    <p>The standard twelve-bar blues, arguably the most productive resource of the common stock, underwent profound transformations in the transition from prewar to postwar popular music. When large segments of the African American population migrated to cities in the years following the Second World War, traditional blues traveled with themâ€”but the new urban environment engendered alternative approaches to blues that reflected the new circumstances, and rhythm and blues emerged as an urbanized transformation of the earlier, more rural genre. As many scholars have observed, rhythm and blues was emphatically energetic and highly electrified, but what has received less attention are the many new compositional approaches that marked the emerging style. In addition to electrification and livelier tempos, rhythm and blues was characterized by faster textual pacing, greater phrase-rhythmic density, and pervasive elaboration of the twelve-bar idiom, changes that were similarly engendered by the new urban environment. These developments had profound implications for the postwar common stock, because both Black and white musicians forged much of the newly dominant genre of rock and roll from these modern twelve-bar variants. This presentation explores the postwar transformation of the twelve-bar blues through the work of several pivotal rhythm and blues musicians, including Willie Dixon, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles, and Fats Domino.</p>
