  <p>In <i>Classical Form</i>, William Caplin proposes that we enhance our
  understanding of sonata form by recognizing the tour-of-keys model, in which
  the development section explores various development keys and tonicized
  regions. This model contrasts with the characteristic Schenkerian view, the
  tonal-polarity model, in which the keys explored in the development are
  subsumed into a large-scale dominant prolongation. The main goal of this
  presentation is to demonstrate that many development sections run through a
  tour of keys that are independent of dominant prolongation. In pursuit of this
  idea, I explore sonata-form movements by Haydn and Mozart whose development
  sections are particularly resistant to a reading of large-scale dominant
  prolongation—all end on a development-key dominant rather than the home-key
  dominant, and then proceed directly to the home-key tonic in the
  recapitulation. Some of these development sections never even touch upon the
  home-key dominant. The “dominant-ness” of the final development-key dominant
  provides a persuasive goal for the section, and supplies the requisite
  compulsion to move toward the “tonic-ness” of the home-key tonic, even though
  the dominant and tonic belong to different keys. Another object is to achieve
  some reciprocity and balance in the complimentary relationship between the
  tour-of-keys model and the Schenkerian approach to prolongational structure.
  The Schenkerian approach is enhanced by integration with the tour-of-keys
  model, and the tour-of-keys model becomes more refined through a synthesis
  with the Schenkerian concept of dominant prolongation within a development
  key. The combination of both approaches leads to a more balanced
  interpretation of sonata form.</p>
