  <p>Perched thirteen feet above the ground at the rear of a mail coach, the
  <i>guard</i> stands and precariously balances as the carriage jostles across
  the bumpy road. He grips the vehicle with his left hand and, with his right,
  points his unwieldy, fifty-two-inch coach horn away from the headwind and the
  driver’s whip to sound the tune, “Clear the Road,” one of ten standard road
  signals used on European and American postal vehicles, or mail coaches, during
  the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Scholars have traditionally presumed
  that the straight, valveless coach horns served only a utilitarian function,
  and that the instruments faded from use when train transport replaced the
  postal coaches by the 1840s. However, this study introduces new material that
  shows how the coach horns were subsequently adopted into popular use and,
  moreover, became the subject of pedagogical rigor and artistic reflection.
  Engaging questions about utility and aesthetics, this paper offers an expanded
  history of the coach horn, showing how middle- and upper-class circles in
  England, America, and France adopted the mail coach and its signal instruments
  for recreational use at horse races, parades, and other social events. Drawing
  from coach horn treatises and newspaper articles from 1860 to the early 1900s,
  I examine the ways that coach horn enthusiasts experimented with the
  instrument, propelling the composition of coach horn repertory, the
  publication of manuals for amateur players, and the formation of coach horn
  societies. My analysis centers on a collection of coach horn trios and sextets
  published in Passevant and Viney’s little-known treatise <i>Methode de Trompe
  de Mail-Coach</i> (1893); these marches, mazurkas, fantasies, polkas, and
  “<i>morceaux concertants</i>” encapsulate how coach horn circles reconceived
  and reframed the coach horn for sociable use and leisure. This study not only
  presents an enriched portrait of the coach horn tradition, but it also
  addresses cross-continental vernacular practices, introduces new areas of
  inquiry in the study of brass repertory, and identifies ways that the coach
  horn community’s experimentation with timbre and texture ultimately intersects
  with mainstream musical trends in the late nineteenth century.</p>
