    <p>This study focuses on music by the contemporary British singer-songwriter and guitarist, Leanne La Havas. Building upon previous theoretical work on guitar fretboard transformations, the paper examines how La Havas creates a clearly organized gestural strategy in her guitar-based songs through use of chromatic linear progressions and elegantly economical movements on the guitar fretboard. While chord shapes in this music build upon a legacy of R&amp;B and rock guitar playing, their deployment in La Havas’s layered textures enables the projection of extended jazz harmonies and a multilayered approach to tonality and large-scale design.</p>
    <p>The paper also considers the music of Leanne La Havas as <em>mediated</em> expression, in which her vocal and guitar work serves to project the music’s corporeal grounding and expressive interiority, while the collaborative ensemble and studio production elements position the song’s protagonist in a multivalent and complex personic environment. This involves loose or “divorced” counterpoint between the voice and instruments as well as more complex multilayered interactions in divergent textures. This study examines how multilayered textures provide for the staging of musical agency, projecting a protagonist that navigates shifts between temporal modes of groove-based circularity and goal-directed expression while participating in a social discourse in which individual parts may be aligned or creatively misaligned. Dynamic polarities of circularity and linearity provide La Havas with a creative framework for embodied expression grounded in traditions of soul, funk, and jazz.</p>
