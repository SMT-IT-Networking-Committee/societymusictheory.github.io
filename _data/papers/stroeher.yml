abstract: |
  <p>Annabelle Paetsch’s 1998 assertion that Britten’s vocal works are “permeated
  by narrative devices” deserves further scrutiny, particularly in light of more
  recent scholarship on musical narrativity (Almén 2008; Kramer 2013; Reyland,
  2013) and the application of narratological theory to lyric poetry (Hühn and
  Kiefer 2005) and the German lied (Weaver 2014). Although scholars of Britten’s
  compositions have made use of narratology, semiotics, and discourse analysis in
  their work (Rupprecht 2001; Gopinath 2013; Whitesell 2013; Mark 2017; Stroeher
  2018), none have considered Britten’s acknowledgment of mediation events (Hühn,
  2005) in which the speaker, consciously or unconsciously, gives or loses
  control to another mediating entity. The poems of Britten’s Donne cycle are
  particularly rich with such occurrences. Donne often disrupts the speaker’s
  perspective—the lyric “I”—with a shift in focalization or point of view. In
  fact, there are numerous characters in these poems, each of whom vies with the
  speaker for attention. Mistresses, thieves, drunkards, lechers, and even
  personifications of death, sickness and the soul haunt the speaker’s
  contemplations. Donne sometimes underscores the appearances of these external
  agents with subtle and not-so-subtle changes in the speaker’s mode of
  mediation, including variations in temporality and disruptions to syntactical
  patterns. </p>
  <p>A thorough analysis reveals that Britten highlighted many of Donne’s
  external focalizations, and even <i>added</i> a few of his own making, giving
  these characters voice through mimesis, pattern changes, harmonic conflict, and
  use of imagined and diegetic sounds. But, Britten’s additional
  focalizations—those beyond Donne’s—suggest a more complex approach to the
  protagonist in these subjective readings. Composed in 1945 after a tour of
  German concentration camps, the cycle has long been understood as a reaction to
  the horrors of his experience, with much made in the literature about the theme
  of death. Britten’s focalizations of non-diegetic characters—especially those
  of his own choosing—illumine a more nuanced response that allows us to assert
  this cycle as reflecting a more personal, internal conflict about his status as
  a conscientious objector. Considered anew, the cycle sheds new light on
  Britten’s post-war output and his thoughts on societal injustice.</p>
