abstract: |
    <p>This paper considers a recent “ethical turn” in music theory and
    musicology through the following analogy: musical hermeneutics occupies the
    same place in music theory as psychoanalysis does in the human sciences. Both
    deal with desire and interpretation. Both find resistance from positivism and
    metaphysics. These resistances are matched by an autoimmune resistance, a
    denial to analyze themselves as disciplines which results from their
    dependence on a principle of sovereignty, a “mastery drive”
    (<i>Bemächtigungstrieb</i>) (Derrida 2002). Both, finally, assume an ethical
    position: for musical hermeneutics, music is a promise of freedom that
    parallels the psychoanalytic promise of happiness (Lacan 2008). The main wager
    of the ethical turn in musicology is to make musical works “into living things
    towards which we must develop an ethical position” (Abbate 2004). For Abbate,
    we cannot repay the gift of freedom that music offers by “putting the
    gift-giver in a cage,” that is, assigning a determinate meaning to the
    plurality offered by music. Lawrence Kramer (2016) holds that freedom is the
    condition for interpretation, while William Cheng (2016) associates musical
    autonomy and academic freedom as a condition that demands reparative care in
    response. Throughout these diverse cases, freedom depends on a metaphysics of
    sovereignty as autonomy and omnipotence of the (autoimmune) subject: to
    interpret, withhold interpretation, or replace interpretation with care. But,
    if the analogy still holds, as long as musical hermeneutics does not think its
    own mastery drive, its interpretations will remain the source of resistance
    from outside and from within.</p>
