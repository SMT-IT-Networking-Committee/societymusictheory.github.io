    <p>If culture, as cognitive philosopher Dan Sperber states, is the sum of
    communication and cognition (Sperber 1996, 97), the study of musical
    performance should include not only analyses of commonalities across
    performances, but also the artifacts of communicative constraints and
    pressures. A great deal of research has been done on how constraints in
    expressive timing in musical performance tend to be consistent in a number of
    ways: performers decelerate at the ends of phrases as a way of communicating
    grouping structure; they communicate metric structure with patterns of long
    and short durations (Sloboda 1983; see Ohriner). Examining multiple
    performative readings of the same piece can shed a great deal of light on the
    piece (see Dodson 2008; Ohriner 2012; Cook 2013).</p>
    <p>Here, I present a corpus-based approach to examine the shifting trends in
    the performance of functionally-ambiguous phrases, examining multiple
    instances of functional ambiguity in performances of Debussy’s <i>Préludes</i>
    throughout the 20th century. I argue that there is a marked change in how
    aspects of tension and resolution (and therefore harmonic function) are
    interpreted throughout the course of the past century and how these ambiguous
    moments seem to be situated culturally (Byros 2009). Early performances seem
    to exploit ambiguities more, and the treatment of harmonic function is one
    that is more explicit and direct in the later part of the 20th century. This
    paper discusses the ramifications of this, and how cognition and communication
    of musical structure through expressive timing is culturally and temporally
    situated.</p>
