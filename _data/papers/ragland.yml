title: "‘<i>A Mi San Antonio</i> (For My San Antonio)’: Eva Ybarra’s Dissonance in the Hypermasculine World of Tejano Conjunto"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Tejano music history is told through the life and music of its
  accordionists. Manuel Peña’s 1985 book, <i>The</i> <i>Texas-Mexican Conjunto:
    History of a Working-class Music</i>, initiated this precedent by claiming
  that the accordionists he calls “<i>los músicos modernos</i>” (the modern
  musicians) had “forged the final stage of conjunto music’s evolution”
  (mid-1950s to late-1970s). Conspicuously absent is San Antonio’s Eva Ybarra: a
  2017 National Heritage Award Fellow and accordionist with a global following.
  Ybarra’s decades-long exclusion from masculinist scholarly and popular
  representations of Tejano (and Chicano) music history is the backdrop of this
  paper, which examines the dissonance she creates as accordionist <i>and
  </i>bandleader and (quoting Chicano scholar Deborah Vargas) a <i>curiosidad
  </i>(curiosity) or spectacle. Ybarra’s small-frame, female body visibly
  sweats, contorts and squeezes out her own challenging scalar runs and complex
  melodic passages as she both challenges and disrupts the highly conservative,
  insular and heteromasculinist culture of San Antonio’s Tejano conjunto scene.
  It reveals how Ybarra has—at great cost to her personal, economic and social
  life—maintained her innovative take on conjunto music and the San Antonio
  sound in the studio and in live performances, while navigating her paradoxical
  position as a celebrated, though perpetually marginalized, musician.</p>
