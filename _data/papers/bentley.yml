abstract: |
  <p>In the first half of the nineteenth century, Cuba had a thriving operatic
  life; performances of imported Italian and (to a lesser extent) French operas
  came to play an integral role in a linguistically and racially diverse
  cultural sphere. The island itself, meanwhile, served as a focal point in the
  increasingly tangled networks that operated between the newly independent
  nations of Latin America, the United States, and Europe. Cuba remained under
  Spanish colonial control, but it attained an important individual identity
  through its centrality to the global sugar trade.</p>
  <p>Considerations of the island’s operatic history during this period have
  remained confined to a few locally written accounts with limited circulation;
  these have documented aspects of the repertoire and the critical reception of
  certain works staged at Havana’s theaters. Meanwhile, although Cuba’s role in
  more explicitly commercial networks in this period has been well researched,
  there has as yet been little attempt to understand the significance of the
  island’s operatic culture beyond Havana or in an international context.</p>
  <p>In this paper, therefore, I will explore the multiple operatic networks
  within which Cuba operated from the turn of the nineteenth century to c.1860.
  I focus on the various processes that initially brought opera to Santiago de
  Cuba and Havana, before turning to Cuba’s substantial influence on the
  operatic life of cities such as New Orleans and New York in the following
  decades. While I touch on opera’s integration into Cuban identity by various
  groups within the highly stratified local population, I principally
  investigate how our understanding of opera in Cuba changes if it is treated as
  one of the island’s many imports and exports during this period—as a commodity
  to be traded—in particular with its northern neighbor, the United States.
  Shaped by both colonialist and wider capitalist processes, operatic transfer
  did not, I suggest, simply replicate these patterns: instead, its delicate
  position within both the artistic and the commercial spheres allowed opera to
  play a particularly significant (and illuminating) role in cultural
  development across and between the Americas.</p>
