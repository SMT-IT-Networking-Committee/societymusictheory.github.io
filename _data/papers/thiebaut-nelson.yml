abstract: |
    <p>Traditional methods of musical analysis tend to treat chord symmetry as
    a binary property: chords are either symmetrical or they are not. Symmetry is
    thus understood as a static property that inheres in a chord. This paper
    proposes instead a dynamic, transformational approach to chord asymmetry by
    addressing two questions: 1) is it possible to render an asymmetrical chord
    symmetrical by adjusting one of its tones by some distance (cardinality stays
    the same)? And 2) is it possible to render it symmetrical by adjoining one or
    more tones (cardinality increases)? The authors refer to these distinct
    symmetrical potentialities as ‘degrees of near–symmetry.’</p>

    <p>To measure the symmetrical potentiality of a collection, the authors
    draw and extend upon the literature on parsimonious voice-leading
    distances as elucidated in Callender, Tymoczko and Quinn (2008) and
    Douthett and Steinbach (1998), as well as on the atonal voice-leading
    literature by Straus (1997, 2003, 2005, 2011) and transformational theory
    by Lewin (1982, 1987, 1992). Having calculated the near–symmetry degrees
    of all pc-sets from cardinalities 3 through 6, the authors explore
    relationships between pc-sets not generally considered to be closely
    related but that share the same (or similar) symmetrical potentiality and
    examine how these otherwise-disparate sets are deployed in similar manners
    across the work of various composers. The authors also explore the various
    ways in which pc-sets with special degrees of near–symmetry behave in
    certain parsimonious and SUM-class voice-leading spaces.</p>
