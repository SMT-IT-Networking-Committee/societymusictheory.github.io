abstract: |
    <p>Neoliberal forces impinge upon academic research, forcing it towards
    instrumental and ideological adaptation to the existing economic and political
    reality. In this context Lacanian psychoanalysis is pertinent, for its
    analytic acts aim not to enable the patient to adapt to pre-existent reality,
    but rather to acknowledge that the repressed forces of the drive destabilize
    attempts at naturalizing such adaptations. Since ideological interpellation is
    also reliant on such naturalizing maneuvers, psychoanalysis is therefore a
    useful ally for helping music theory resist the forces that increasingly
    pressure it into accepting the ideological coordinates of the present. This
    paper thus proposes that music theorists relate to music in a fashion
    analogous to how psychoanalysts relate to patients: by desiring to illuminate
    how something always exceeds and destabilizes full adaptation to presiding
    discursive contexts. This would necessitate analytic and hermeneutic practice,
    for as in the talking-cure, where the specificity of the patient’s speech
    catches her out in relationship to the impossibility of her identifications,
    here the specificity of each music’s mode of non-alignment can most
    effectively be stumbled upon. Since in the scene of music theory such
    discursive contexts are created by music theorists themselves, analytic and
    hermeneutic practices would therefore also be as much self-reflexive
    interrogation of the music theorist as it would be musically illuminating. And
    through such self-reflection, the specificity of the theorist’s musical
    relations would once more find a route back to her discursive relations to the
    neo-liberal academy.</p>
