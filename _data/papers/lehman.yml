    <p>Brian Eno's famous dictum concerning ambient music, that “it must be as
    ignorable as it is interesting,” presents a curious challenge to analysts.
    To the extent that analysis reflects listener responses to music, then
    interpretations of ambient compositions should reckon with the ebb and
    flow of attention. The ambient style is often framed as non-hierarchical,
    non-teleological, and sometimes even non-intentional. If these qualities
    are true, and ambient music floats in a vaporous “vertical time” with no
    figure/ground distinction, then traditional <i>formal analysis</i>—the
    study of how events and sections are coordinated to shape musical
    wholes—would seem a tenuous prospect.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I present a case for investigating ambient music in terms
    of larger formal structures than normally acknowledged by either fans or
    creators. To ensure I do not neglect the “ignorability” contingency, I invert
    two established analytical paradigms. First, I devise a set of analytical
    <i>un</i>-salience conditions: gestures and attitudes that permit tuning out
    the music. Second, I flip Fink's (2005) notion of recombinant teleology,
    arguing that ambient music often exhibits overlapping strategies for masking
    or subverting goal-directedness.</p>

    <p>Following illustrative examples from various artists, I offer a
    large-scale case-study, <i>The Magnificent Void </i>(1996) by composer
    Steve Roach. Using spectrographic visualizations, I isolate a number of
    structures that give <i>Void</i> a foggy but persistent sense of internal
    memory. My case for “symphonic” architecture is bolstered by a reduction
    that traces timbral and tonal design over the course of the album,
    focusing especially on relative spectral/timbral brightness and
    toneness/noisiness.</p>
