abstract: |
    <p>Can a film score host true thematic transformation, even when the medium's
    musical canvases are short compared to those of art music? Certainly, many
    soundtracks abound with thematic change, especially in leitmotivic franchises.
    Bribitzer-Stull (2015) notes several forms common in Hollywood:
    orchestrational alteration, contrapuntal combination, reharmonization, and
    so on. But what of the more subtle sorts of theme-work—processes like
    teleological genesis, developing variation, harmonic motivicism, concealed
    repetition—what an uncharitable critic like Adorno would not hastily
    dismiss as mere "changes of lighting." This presentation argues that such
    types of thematic transformation do arise in Hollywood, but rarely, and
    always in tension with "anti-transformational" tendencies endemic to film,
    such as musical intermittency, motivic inconsistency, and semantic
    reification.</p>
    <p>With nine leitmotivically-interlinked films and counting, the <i>Star
    Wars</i> saga is the logical franchise in which to weigh the powers and
    limitations of cinematic thematic transformation. Inspired by
    Bribitzer-Stull's categories of thematic development, I propose four
    transformational pathways that work especially effectively in cinematic time:
    apotheosis, assembly, insinuation, and infusion. Each technique is
    illustrated with reference to a single leitmotif: "Across the Stars,"
    "Revelation," "Rey," and "Rebel Fanfare." A longer case-study is offered for
    the "March of the Resistance" in the recent <i>Episode VIII: The Last Jedi
    </i>(2017), whose conversion from melody into a strictly modulatory motif
    bears hallmarks of all four transformational pathways. Throughout this
    presentation, I examine and critique the impulses behind leitmotivic analysis,
    which so easily contorts itself into cryptographic extravagance—not always, I
    conclude, such a bad thing.</p>
