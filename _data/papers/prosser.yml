    <p>I examine compositional evidence of the influence of Sergei Taneev’s
    theory of horizontal-shifting counterpoint on his student, Sergei
    Rachmaninoff, and develop an approach for composing horizontal-shifting
    counterpoint.</p>
    <p>In his 1909 treatise <i>Podvizhnoi kontrapunkt strogogo pis’ma</i>
    (Shifting counterpoint in the strict style), Taneev theorized two broad
    categories of “shifting counterpoint”: vertical-shifting counterpoint, more
    commonly known as invertible counterpoint, in which voices are shifted
    relative to each other in pitch space; and horizontal-shifting
    counterpoint, in which voices are shifted relative to each other in
    temporal space. While Taneev provided a thorough and systematic approach to
    composing vertical-shifting counterpoint, his treatment of
    horizontal-shifting counterpoint only provides a system for labeling the
    direction and time-point interval of the shift. And while the practical
    compositional applications of vertical-shifting (i.e., invertible)
    counterpoint are already well established (and were so long before Taneev),
    it remains to be seen how the more obscure technique of horizontal-shifting
    counterpoint has any relevance to compositional practice.</p>
    <p>I will address both of these issues by first looking at evidence of the
    influence of Taneev’s theories on one of his students, Sergei Rachmaninoff,
    in two compositions: Rachmaninoff’s early choral work <i>Deus meus</i>, and
    one of his mature piano works, the <i>Étude-tableau</i> op. 33, no. 4 in D
    minor. I will then theorize a method for composing horizontal-shifting
    counterpoint in strict species counterpoint, with applications to the
    related techniques of canon and stretto.</p>
