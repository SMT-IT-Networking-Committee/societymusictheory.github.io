    <p>In the mid-1950s, Boulez radically transformed his approach to serialism through the development of new compositional techniques. Although the operation of multiplication was chief amongst these developments, and remained important to his approach for the remainder of his career, rotational arrays also played a significant role. Boulez’s multiplication techniques have recently received renewed scholarly attention, largely due to breakthroughs made possible by the availability of his compositional sketches (Decroupet 2006, Scotto 2014, Losada 2014, 2017, 2019, Salem 2014, 2018). Rotational arrays, which are linked to but distinct from multiplication techniques, have had a tangential role in these discussions. This paper outlines how rotational arrays appeared in varied formats throughout Boulez’s compositional career, as well as structural elements, both linked to and distinct from those underlying multiplication techniques, which are responsible for their important role in Boulez’s output. In this way, it sheds light on Boulez’s application of this technique in relation to Stravinsky’s more publicized usage.</p>
