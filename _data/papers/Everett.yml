abstract: | 
    <p>In her concerto for sheng (Chinese mouth organ) and orchestra (2009), Unsuk Chin deconstructs the traditional concerto form: while the sheng and orchestral instruments participate in a contest where the latter act as the soloist’s shadow and echo to form organically evolving textures, the contraction and expansion of the metric framework based on the formal proportion of 4+3 generate temporal ruptures that resist traditional forms of development. The proposed paper focuses on the role of ritual and rotation in this one-movement concerto for sheng and orchestra. In Egyptian mythology, <em>Šu</em> is a symbol for air, a concept that refers to the sheng’s articulations and extended techniques in accompanying instruments that cover a wide spectrum from pitch to noise. The circular formation of the main notes introduced by the sheng provides its harmonic foundation as well as the rotational principle that articulates the concerto’s main formal junctures. While using the rotational principle in the sheng’s harmony and changing metric framework and textures as the basis of my formal analysis, I will interpret the organic processes the concerto traverses with respect to Shaministic rituals in Korean traditional music—e.g., the rhythms and energy formation of Samulnori drumming figures prominently in the course of this concerto. In closing, I will situate Chin’s compositional aesthetics and her transcultural identity within the globalized terrain of contemporary music of the twenty-first century and, more specifically, in reference to music by other notable composers of East Asian heritage.</p>
