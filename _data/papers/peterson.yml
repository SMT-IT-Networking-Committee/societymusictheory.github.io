abstract: |
  <p>Hip hop producer J Dilla (James Yancey) is widely acclaimed by listeners
  and fellow musicians for his distinct approaches to rhythm in his beats, which
  writers have called “wobbly,” “woozy,” and “tipsy.” Instrumentalists and
  producers alike have been profoundly affected by Dilla’s work. For example,
  jazz pianist Robert Glasper said, “He’s the producer that makes you change the
  way you play.” However, scholars have yet to explain characteristic rhythmic
  features of his work or what makes it so compelling to both hip hop producers
  and instrumentalists.</p>
  <p>Like most hip hop producers of the 1990s and 2000s, Dilla used digital
  samplers to create loops, imparting a strictly mechanical aspect to the
  rhythms of his beats. Nonetheless, as Dilla biographer Jordan Ferguson
  observes, Dilla often let “mistakes” remain in his beats. According to Dilla,
  such irregularities allowed his music “to have that live feel.” Thus, Dilla’s
  approach to sampling foregrounded a human-performative element common to more
  traditional instrumental forms, such as jazz or funk. Proceeding from Ingrid
  Monson’s (1996) ethnographic work with jazz musicians, I propose that the
  peculiar rhythmic combinations in Dilla’s beats appeal to musicians because
  they are perceived as similar to expressive gestures in live performance of
  other Afro-diasporic styles. </p>
  <p>Building on Anne Danielsen’s (2010) work, this paper uses close listening
  and visual renderings of wave forms from recordings to analyze four of Dilla’s
  beats in which microtiming variations figure prominently in the rhythmic
  makeup. I argue that their wobbly character results from the way Dilla wove
  previously undesirable rhythmic inconsistencies into a stable rhythmic
  texture, combining early and late, straight and swung, triple and duple in
  unprecedented ways. Using reception studies, I conclude that two reasons fans
  and fellow musicians often speak of Dilla as an innovator are the particularly
  bold ways his productions navigate the balance between “human” and
  “mechanical” characteristics inherent in sample-based hip hop production, and
  his refusal to accept outside limitations on his processes. </p>
