  <p>The problematic status of sonata form in Mahler’s late symphonies has been
  well documented. Monahan (2015) argues that neither the opening movements of
  the Ninth nor the Tenth “feels much like a sonata” (29). And Utz (2011)
  situates the Ninth Symphony as the culmination of symphonic disintegration:
  “The work takes up an extreme position within the (Un-)Logic of Mahler’s
  symphonic compositions in its worsening of formal discontinuity” (303). While
  the outer movements of the late works all project varying degrees of dialogue
  with sonata procedure, each demands careful consideration of the question:
  What is the virtue of a sonata form reading?</p>
  <p>If, as Hepokoski and Darcy (2006) contend, the “central generic task of the
  [classical] sonata” is “securing the ESC” (17), Monahan has shown this to
  persist in Mahler’s pre-1907 symphonies. In Part 1 of this paper, I argue that
  the later symphonies express a teleological shift amounting to a fundamental
  divergence from Sonata Theory. The contextually glorified <i>re-arrival</i> of
  the primary theme is now the dramatic objective.</p>
  <p>In Part 2, I juxtapose two of Mahler’s late finales. At issue is the extent
  to which elements of sonata form—in particular, reprise—enrich dramatic
  interpretation. I will show that “Der Abschied” from <i>Das Lied</i> exists in
  meaningful dialogue with sonata form. On the other hand, the <i>Adagio</i> of
  the Ninth Symphony shares some characteristics with “Der Abschied” but lacks
  most sonata hallmarks. In the end, much formal energy is transferred to an
  intensified re-introduction.</p>
