abstract: |
    <p>South Indian Carnatic music is built upon an incredibly intricate system of
    rhythm and meter, based on a background metric cycle called the <i>tāḷa</i>
    that performers and listeners track with specialized hand gestures
    (<i>kriyās</i>). Key to Carnatic conceptions of rhythm and meter are
    <i>sarvalaghu</i>, a rhythmic “flow” generated by gestures supporting the
    underlying tala, and <i>kaṇakku</i>, or “calculation,” referring to more
    complex rhythmic phrases that generate tension with the tala. <i>Kanakku</i>
    plays a particularly important role in improvised portions of Carnatic
    performances, for soloists must determine precisely where to begin a rhythmic
    pattern and how many times to iterate it in order to end a solo at a desired
    point in the tala.</p>
    <p>While previous studies have applied formal music theory to analyzing metric
    tension in Carnatic compositions and transcribed performances or have
    suggested <i>kanakku</i>-based improvisational strategies, this paper seeks to
    combine the theoretical and the performative. Namely, this presentation will
    investigate <i>kanakku</i>-based improvisation using Wells’s (2015a; 2017)
    metric generalized interval system, (GIS) Met, which can quantify conflicts
    between the tala and a soloist’s melodic/rhythmic phrasing. Using Met, this
    paper will numerically investigate how special rhythmic cadences called
    <i>mōrās </i>can be strategically implemented within various talas and
    transformed via changing beat subdivisions (<i>naḍais</i>) or
    expanding/contracting pulse units (<i>trikāla</i> technique). Through
    Met-intervallic analysis of such improvisational strategies, this paper will
    suggest new ways of conceptualizing <i>kannaku</i>-based improvisation that do
    not supersede traditional Carnatic methods, but provide a complementary
    perspective that can generate new insights into this sophisticated music.</p>
