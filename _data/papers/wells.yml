    <p>David Lewin’s generalized interval system (GIS) and transformational
    theories have profoundly impacted the music-theoretic discipline since the
    publication of <i>Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations</i>
    (1987), inspiring wide-ranging analytical and theoretical studies. While
    the mathematical underpinnings of Lewin’s theories are well known, Hook
    (2007b) and Hall (2009) have noted Lewin’s frequent departures in <I>GMIT
    </I>from standard mathematical writing, often blurring the boundaries
    between music and mathematics. Tymoczko (2009), too, observes how Lewin’s
    musical assumptions often color his mathematics, while the mathematics
    sometimes limits musical applications.</p>

    <p>To more precisely characterize Lewin’s approach to mathematical
    music-theoretic writing, the current paper will consider how Lewin’s
    framing of the GIS construct early in <I>GMIT</I> demonstrates an
    idiosyncratic bridging of musical and mathematical realms. Specifically,
    the first part of this paper will consider how Lewin’s <i>int</i>
    functions define diverse mappings between musical spaces (involving pitch,
    rhythmic, and harmonic objects) and mathematical ones (generally numerical
    spaces or mathematical groups). The second part of this paper will then
    consider, using Lewin’s “failed” duration GIS as a case study, how Lewin’s
    implicit restrictions on these spaces and their interrelations can be
    unnecessarily limiting. A temporal analysis of a Bach crab canon will
    exemplify how less restrictive boundaries on musical and mathematical
    domains can motivate new avenues of transformational research.</p>
