abstract: |
  <p>In his <i>Young People’s Concerts</i> and elsewhere, Leonard Bernstein
  communicated music analytical observations in a language friendly to the
  general audience. His most ambitious efforts resulted in the lecture series
  entitled <i>The Unanswered Question</i>. Like other examples of his public
  scholarship, these lectures reveal many analytical insights; but here, as in
  no other place in his literary legacy, Bernstein contextualized these insights
  within a theoretical framework to clarify the foundational values guiding his
  analytical decisions. Thus, while these lectures certainly contain examples of
  public music <i>analysis</i>, they also constitute Bernstein’s greatest effort
  to produce public music <i>theory</i>.</p>
  <p>Theoretically, Bernstein relies on an adaptation of Noam Chomsky’s
  universal grammar and transformational-generative grammar, particularly the
  foundational ideas of phonology, syntax, and semantics. The source materials
  also show that initially Bernstein had planned to focus much less on musical
  monogenesis, and more on issues of identity and difference. In this paper, I
  excavate interesting aspects found among the research materials and drafts for
  these lectures at the Library of Congress. Reading these materials in the
  context of the published lectures magnifies the tensions between structure and
  surface, and between the universal and the specific, which lie at the heart of
  many of Bernstein’s analytical assumptions. The paper not only leads to a
  better understanding of Bernstein’s music theoretical orientation, it is also
  instructive for those of us interested in both public music analysis
  <i>and</i> public music theory. </p>
