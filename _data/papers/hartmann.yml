      bio: |
        <p>Pianist Greg Hartmann is currently pursuing his doctoral studies at the Graduate Center, CUNY, as a student of Julian Martin. Greg recently won first prize in the 2018 Memphis International Piano Competition, second prize in the top division of the 2019 Schubert Club Scholarship Competition, third prize in the 2019 Thousand Islands International Piano Competition, third prize in the 2018 High Point University Piano Competition, and received the Jung-Springberg Award for Outstanding Musicianship in the 2018 Kuleshov International Piano Competition. He was also the first prizewinner in the 2016 Walter A. and Dorothy J. Oestreich Concerto Competition, 2016 Rochester Symphony Young Artist Competition, and the 2016 Lakeshore Wind Ensemble Young Artist Competition. Also an accomplished composer, Greg won the 2018 Paula Nelson-Guenther Young Composer Competition with his orchestral work <em>Requiem for a Memory: Nocturne for Orchestra</em>. He has performed concerti with the New Albany Symphony Orchestra, Rochester Symphony, Lakeshore Wind Ensemble, Concord Chamber Orchestra, and Waukesha Area Chamber Orchestra. He also maintains an interest in Music Theory, in which he also holds a Master’s degree. Greg has performed in masterclasses for many renowned artists including Robert McDonald, James Tocco, Daniel Shapiro, Eugene Pridonoff, Roland Krueger, James Giles, and Douglas Humpherys, and has participated in music festivals including the Aspen Music Festival and School, Pianofest in the Hamptons, the Bowdoin International Music Festival, the Sejong International Music Festival, Euro Music Festival and Academy, and the Gijón International Piano Festival. In his free time, Greg enjoys tennis, running, and ping pong.</p>

    <p>Parsimonious voice leading has been well studied for tonal music, but the existing literature defines parsimony in a way that severely limits its application to pitch-class spaces with a cardinality larger than 12. Instead of conceiving of parsimony as a minimal number of the smallest step in a given cardinality, we can consider allowing the equivalent of one standard whole step of voice leading motion (up to <span class="math inline">1/6</span> of an octave or <span class="math inline"><em>c</em>/6</span> steps in any cardinality <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>.) This prevents the motion from becoming imperceptibly small at higher cardinalities and allows for parsimonious trichords analogous to (037) in cardinalities that are not a multiple of three.</p>
    <p><strong>Following Straus’s (2005) similarity measure for set-classes, I also construct a concept of fuzzy set-classes. This allows the comparison of set-classes in higher cardinalities with familiar set-classes (where</strong><span class="math inline"> <em>c</em> = 12)</span> <strong>and allows the analyst to emphasize the similarity of two sets that may not belong to the same set-class.</strong></p>
    <p>The expanded application of these existing tools to this new repertoire not only allows us to more fully understand the voice leading structures in microtonal pieces, but also reveals parallels between techniques of microtonal composition and the more well-studied techniques of tonal composition. For instance, I demonstrate that it uncovers operations in microtonal music analogous to the familiar Neo-Riemannian P, L, and R operations. Overall, I show that an extension in the definition of parsimony reveals structures in microtonal music analogous to structures in tonal music.</p>
