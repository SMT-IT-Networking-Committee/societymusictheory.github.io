    <p>Due to epistemological priority given by the hegemonic musicological discourse to the classical canon and its aesthetic expectations, the prime role that institutionalized harmonic theory has bestowed on the major (triad and mode) and the tonic-dominant axis relegates the minor and the tonic-subdominant axis to a place of lesser prestige and structural importance. However, a large number of works emerging from influential tonal traditions such as the 19th-century European literate music and 20th- and 21st-century popular musics (e.g., Brazilian bossa nova and Latin American rock) conspicuously displays two forms of plagal drive: 1) higher-level tonal trajectories dramatized by a structural subdominant chord and 2) lower-level strategies that emphasize the subdominant. Developing from the premise that <em>harmonic and syntactic functions</em> are manifestations of different properties of tonality, and building upon a renewed interest in harmonic dualism as well as recent works by pop and rock-music scholars, this paper foregrounds the role of the plagal force in tonal music, laying out a system of principles, concepts, and analytical instruments that overflows the pervasive classical modeling of tonal hearing. By developing analytical tools that accommodate the idiosyncrasies of canonic and underrepresented repertoires within a broader tonal continuum, this paper seeks to appeal to analysts willing to embrace the richness of tonal music, thus ultimately contributing to the much-needed task of fostering diversity and inclusivity in current analytical, theoretical, and pedagogical musical practices.</p>
