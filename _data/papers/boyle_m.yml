    <p>Discussions of <i>primo ottocento</i> opera have long understated its
    harmonic qualities. I contend that this persistent attitude is the residue of
    a historic shift in the meanings of harmony. In the decades surrounding 1800,
    and, largely fuelled by the theories of Rameau, harmony began to describe
    primarily the rules governing chordal objects. It subsequently shed its prior
    usage as a descriptor of texture. Before discarding its textural meanings,
    harmony did not stand solely as a prime exemplar of what Leonard Meyer called
    syntactic parameters in music. Harmony instead encompassed both syntactic and
    statistical parameters equally, uniting the spiritual and the material. The
    writings of Sulzer, Burney, Rousseau, Stendhal, FÃ©tis, and the Italian
    pedagogical tradition preserve these antiquated meanings of harmony. Harmony,
    in short, once was used to describe musical syntaxes and musical textures,
    usually in one of five ways: as chordal, as instrumental, as contrapuntal, as
    timbral, and as a measure of euphony. The conservative tradition of
    <i>ottocento </i>opera demands re-expanding the semantic scope of harmony to
    its pre-Ramellian borders. Instead of emphasizing metaphysical chromaticism,
    Italian operas placed aesthetic attention of the material qualities of
    harmony. I examine the harmonic materiality of two sets of conventions: a
    timbrally luxurious <i>messa di voce</i> gesture and the haptic sensualism of
    pizzicato accompaniments. Such an attitude suggests paths of dialogue between
    music theory and recent trends in operatic criticism which prize the material,
    bodily, and drastic components of musical experiences over the compositional,
    technical, and the hermeneutic.</p>
