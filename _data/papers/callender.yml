abstract: |
  <p>In Ligeti’s late works, the composer often partitions the chromatic scale
  into complementary and familiar collections, such as white-note diatonic and
  black-note pentatonic collections, opposing whole-tone scales, and so forth.
  At times it is difficult to attend to the partitions separately, and the
  music seems to hover somewhere between diatonic and pentatonic (or
  whole-tone) collections and the total chromatic. This hovering between tonal
  and non-tonal, familiar and unfamiliar elements is a hallmark of Ligeti’s
  late works, which use complementary collections extensively and
  systematically to achieve what Richard Steinitz terms combinatorial
  tonality, “the illusion of a third or resultant tonality created from the
  combination of the other two.” While there are clear precedents in the use
  of complementary collections, Ligeti’s extensive use of this technique in
  his late works and, in particular, his exploration of the unfamiliar
  harmonic possibilities between collections and the ways in which a
  listener’s attention can be focused on the intervallic relations within and
  between collections (what I term the intra- and inter-harmonies) is unique.
  Indeed, the technique of complementary collections may represent Ligeti’s
  most systematic approach to achieving his goal of creating music that is
  neither tonal nor atonal. This presentation focuses on the theoretical
  properties of complementary collections and Ligeti’s exploration and
  realizations of the corresponding possibilities in several of the late
  works, including many of the Piano Etudes and the Piano and Violin
  Concertos.</p>
