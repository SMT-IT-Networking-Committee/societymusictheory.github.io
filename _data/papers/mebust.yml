abstract: |
  <p>Of all laborers contributing to musical cultures, least attention is paid to
  real-life muses, despite the ubiquity of mythological ones. Norwegian women
  musicians Nina Grieg and Gjendine Slålien acted as muses for the composers
  Edvard Grieg and Julius Röntgen, producing so-called inspiration by freely
  providing creative materials, such as performance collaboration, original
  melodies, and critical musical insight. Drawing critically on Danish singer
  Julius Steenberg’s 1892 text <i>Muser og Sirener</i> [<i>Muses and Sirens</i>],
  which discusses the varying contributions of performers and pedagogues on the
  state of Scandinavian music, I interrogate the role of romance and sexuality in
  creative production; the ethics of musical quotation and corruption; and, most
  importantly, how “feminized labor” contributes to musical production. Labor is
  “feminized” when wages associated with women’s work are suppressed, when there
  is an expectation of freely provided domestic, emotional, and sexual labor
  (sometimes called “care labor”), and when labor markets are subject to
  gender-based discrimination and coercion. The marital and romantic nature of
  the relationship between the Griegs points to one of the primary forms of
  feminized labor, the expectation of labor within a marriage. This same
  expectation of Slålien is evidenced by the marriage proposal she received from
  Julius Röntgen after the death of his wife.</p>
  <p>Both Slålien and Nina Grieg were accomplished musicians, but their labors
  have been eclipsed by the male composers who used them. While the career
  aspirations of either woman outside of their relationships with the composers
  in question are uncertain, the actual benefits they received from their
  creative labors are difficult to quantify. Nina Grieg certainly benefitted
  financially from the broad successes of her husband, but would have been left
  with nothing had he left her (as he nearly did in 1883). Slålien obtained some
  local fame and opportunities to perform at a national level, but remained a
  subsistence farmer for her entire life. In short, these women are readable as
  nineteenth-century muses, idealized as creative spirits without material need
  or the agency to make their creative visions coalesce, despite the realities of
  their human conditions.</p>
