abstract: | 
    <p>Internalized beliefs about how to answer the question “What makes us human?” undergird discourse about what kinds of cultural production are valuable. As Sylvia Wynter has argued, Western epistemology has long centered a White concept of the human that creates and sustains itself in opposition to racialized Others. A revision of the epistemological principles that have been used to determine who is and is not human is necessary to disrupt and unsettle the coloniality of power that prevails in Western society and its institutions, including music theory. </p>
    <p>Although <em>techn</em>ē the kind of practical knowledge that allows an expert to produce contingent things—has received little attention in music theoretical discourse, it has a long history as an alternative, non-racialized answer to the question “What makes us human?” In this paper, I consider the disciplinary affordances of centering <em>techn</em>ē as a model for music and music theoretical knowledge. I understand <em>techn</em>ē through its relation to two related concepts: first, <em>epist</em>ē<em>m</em>ē, the theoretical knowledge produced through the application of technical knowledge; and second, <em>physis</em> (nature), which <em>techn</em>ē supplements. Through these dispositions, I arrive at an account of musical <em>techn</em>ē that is specialist, but also universal: although different individuals possess different technical expertise, <em>technai</em> exist in all societies. If musical activity presupposes <em>techn</em>ē, I argue, then the proper domain of music theory is the <em>epist</em>ē<em>m</em>ē the theoretical knowledge that is produced by the application of musical <em>technai.</em></p>
