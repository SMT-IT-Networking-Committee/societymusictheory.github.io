abstract: |
  <p>The concept of popular music has by now been sufficiently problematized
  that it is used self-consciously within the academy. But the work of tracing
  its historical usage and emergence in the nineteenth century (notwithstanding
  the significant contributions made by Matthew Gelbart, Bernd Sponheuer, Derek
  Scott, and David Gramit) has lagged behind the attention given to “absolute
  music,” “program music,” “virtuosity,” and other key terms used to categorize
  nineteenth-century music and musical life, at the time and since. This has
  partly rested on assumptions that the popular (as a by-word for the
  commercial) only becomes either a reception category <i>or</i> a distinctive
  style around 1850. I will argue, however, that the increasing castigation of
  the “Pöbel” [the mob], of “rohe” [coarse] people, and of “ganzallgemeine”
  [common] opinion by professional music critics around 1800 refers to this
  familiar idea. At the same time, the object of criticism, and reason for
  applying it is often unclear: whether it concerns venue, statistical
  consumption, style, listening mode, or genre.</p>
  <p>In my paper, I argue that the extreme self-consciousness of music and
  theatre critics in Berlin ca. 1800 provides a revealing window into the
  development of the nineteenth-century North German discourse of the popular
  that has been so influential—and divisive—within musicology. Reacting to the
  influx of Parisian “boulevard” and Viennese “suburban” theatre, in particular
  the <i>Singspiele</i> of Wenzel Müller, writers projected considerable anxiety
  about their role in guiding public taste. In Berlin at this point all genres
  appeared at the Nationaltheater, in German: without a system of alternative
  theatres to separate spatially the high and the low, audiences—some
  argued—were not distinguishing sufficiently between the works played to them.
  Probing the motivations and processes driving the rhetorical fashioning of a
  concept of the popular as a response to this problem, I show how one city’s
  music professionals negotiated the threat of commercial art, popular taste,
  and agency in the post-revolutionary period, before returning to the vexed
  question of the popular “style” at the time. </p>
