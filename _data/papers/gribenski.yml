  <p>Shortly after France adopted 435 hertz as a national pitch in 1859, American
  voices were clamoring for the same standard in the US While socialites
  entertained the idea of “Europeanness” and the new scientific and musical
  rationality encapsulated in this norm, concert entrepreneurs dedicated to
  oratorio and, more broadly, “the Classics” were equally approving because the
  low frequency was well suited to vocal and ancient music. Finally, for
  prominent instrument builders such as Steinway, the institutionalization of
  this standard promised new avenues for business as 435 was spreading throughout
  Europe. On the other hand, local actors indifferent to the promise of belonging
  to a so-called “universal community,” such as the myriad brass bands or small
  piano builders, resisted standardization, which they saw as an onerous
  imposition. As transnational histories of time, weights and measures have
  shown, the emergence of technological and scientific standards provided local
  and national communities opportunities to define themselves in relation to the
  growing imaginary of an international order. Far from being mere ideas in a
  disembodied history of international relations, these norms had a strong impact
  on social and material practices.</p>
  <p>Drawing on a broad range of unexplored historical documents (instrument
  builders’ and musical unions’ archives, concert societies meetings’ reports,
  Bureau of Standards’ correspondence), this paper highlights the tight
  entanglement of musical practices, technology and struggles over national
  identity. Up to the end of World War I, despite several musical associations’
  adoption of the French norm, pitches remained unsettled in the US absent an
  organizational capacity to regulate musical practices on a national level. In
  turn, the successful implementation of a new standard in the interwar period
  which triumphed on the international stage in 1939—A 440—resulted from the
  creation of a national musical market that involved a deep transformation of
  instrumentalists’ and listeners’ techniques as well as the emergence of new
  modes of craftsmanship. Through a combination of musicological, Science and
  Technology Studies, and transnational perspectives, this paper offers a renewal
  of the historiography of pitch. In doing so, it highlights the undervalued, yet
  critical role played by sound in the history of international relations.</p>
