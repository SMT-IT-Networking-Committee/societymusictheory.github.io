    <p>Our Diné (Navajo) people have long held song as a source of healing and vitality. The multi-functionality and inherent sacredness of song does not accommodate colonial ideals of music analysis and theory; it is almost unfathomable. There is no word for “music” in our language as our “music” is always sung – thus, it is best translated as “song.” Attempts to analyze and understand Diné song have been conducted through acts of “pinning down” (Robinson 2019) Diné song on staves, reducing their agency in the name of salvage ethnography. This talk thus seeks to provide a Diné perspective of analyzing music that maintains the integrity of Diné epistemology of song. Through first examining our Diné language, this talk begins by revealing the unique relationship Diné listeners have to song and music. Further, by providing a basic understanding of Diné philosophy and worldview Sa’ąh Naagháí Bik’eh Hózhóón (SNBH), this talk ultimately seeks to contribute an Indigenous perspective of “music analysis” guided by the four stages of internalization of knowledge for living one’s life process: Nitsáhákees (thinking), Nahat’á (planning), Iiná (life), and Siihasin (fulfillment and hope). Thus, I posit that Diné people, specifically, can also utilize this framework to analyze song and music of all genres, today. For within Siihasin, we decide for ourselves how a song will affect our personhood - and for many Diné people, this particular “analysis” or reflection is paramount to the continued fulfillment of one’s life process.</p>
