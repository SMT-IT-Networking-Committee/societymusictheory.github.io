abstract: |
  <p>Luigi Dallapiccola once described the period from 1938 to 1948—marked by
  the implementation of the Racial Laws in fascist Italy—as ten years spent “in
  spirit with prisoners” (1953). The centerpiece of his resulting protest
  triptych, <i>Il prigioniero</i> is perhaps best known for the hauntingly
  disillusioned “La libertà?” of the final scene, an ending that contrasts
  sharply with the <i>deus ex machina</i> typical of rescue opera. Largely
  neglected is the opera’s temporality, specifically its evocations of nonlinear
  time.</p>
  <p>Linear time in music has long been associated with “goal-oriented”
  tonality, and nonlinearity with atonality (Kramer 1988; Noller 1994). Drawing
  from the work of Kramer and others (Reyland 2013; Dalhaus 1982; Kern 2003;
  Reiner 2000; Almen and Hatten 2013), as well as Dallapiccola’s own writings, I
  situate the twelve-tone technique of <i>Prigioniero</i> alongside theories of
  musical narrative and nonlinearity.</p>
  <p>Dallapiccola’s use of nonlinear time is owed in part to authors James Joyce
  and Marcel Proust, whose prose strategies he found directly analogous to the
  twelve-tone system. Nonlinearity in <i>Prigioniero</i> is achieved through a
  complex nexus of borrowing and self-quotation, <i>leitmotif</i>, structural
  symmetry (the palindromic structure of the opera) stylistic juxtaposition (the
  “tonal” sound of the Freedom row, or contrapuntal techniques like canon), and
  rhythmic and metrical effects like <i>schwebend</i> (floating) rhythms,
  expansion and compression figures, durational layering, and proportionalism.
  Moreover, plot elements in Dallapiccola’s self-written libretto involve the
  audience in nonlinear development. </p>
  <p>Drawing from the work of Samuel (2005) and others, I demonstrate how the
  opera’s “claustrophobic” quality contributes to its nonlinearity. The relative
  brevity of its one act in four scenes—spanning just one hour in length—is
  juxtaposed with the psychological torment and chronophobia of the Prisoner.
  Ambiguities and multiplicities of time, place, circumstance, and character
  abound, including the uncertain presence of the Mother in the prologue; the
  juxtaposition of the Spanish dungeon and fascist Italy; the association of the
  Inquisition and the World War; and the double persona of the Jailer/Grand
  Inquisitor. The interpolation of the off-stage chorus creates temporal,
  spatial, and social juxtapositions that result in overwhelming simultaneity
  and the expansion of the temporal present. </p>
