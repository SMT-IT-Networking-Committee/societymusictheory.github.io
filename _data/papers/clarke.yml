abstract: |
    <p>Scholars have explored Dallapiccola’s formative use of twelve-tone technique, self-quotation, political subtext, and symbolism in his one-act opera <em>Volo di notte</em> (Earle 2013; Maier and Painter 2004; Fearn 1997; Shackelford 1987). However, the figure of Signora Fabien, wife of a doomed pilot and the sole individual to challenge airline director Rivière, remains largely neglected. This paper offers a new perspective on Simona Fabien as an agentic and redemptive figure. I demonstrate how Simona’s melodic disintegration—from lyrical dodecaphony to repetitive chromaticism—signifies the reclaiming of the feminine body as an act of protest.</p>
    <p>While some scholars view Simona as symbol of domestic love and sacrifice, I show how Simona’s interaction with Rivière in scene four of the opera demonstrates the embodiment and voicing of hysteria as a radical act of redemption. Her evolution from penitence to heroic agency is evidenced by Dallapiccola’s use of material from his <em>Tre laudi,</em> hymns to the Virgin Mary, and references to the <em>Voce interna,</em> the sensual soprano line from the opera’s <em>Movimento di Blues</em>. As the <em>Voce interna</em> encroaches upon and displaces <em>Tre laudi</em> material, Simona’s emotional anguish crescendos, her hysteria an act of defiance.</p>
    <p>At the pinnacle of Simona’s hysteria is the swift disintegration of melodic reprise; motives and phrases are attenuated, and pacing quickens through repetition of short, chromatic segments and unpredictable leaps. But Simona is not lost. Her hysteria leads to power through clairvoyance: she overtly predicts Rivière’s fate and foreshadows her husband’s death. Formidable and modern, Simona Fabien demands to be heard.</p>
