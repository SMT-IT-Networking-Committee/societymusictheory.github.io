  <p>Historians have long observed that radio played a significant role in
  establishing a sense of national culture in the 1930s. Network broadcasting
  gave listeners across the country simultaneous access to homogenized news and
  entertainment, thereby fostering an imagined community of isolated yet
  synchronized citizens. It could be argued that this community was at its most
  tangible in the case of community singing programs, which flourished between
  1935 and 1942. These sing-along hours capitalized on the widespread popularity
  of community singing, an activity that had been conducted in entertainment
  venues of the previous decade by song leaders, theater organists, and films.
  Indeed, some of the radio programs were simply broadcasts of movie theater
  sing-alongs, while others were carefully staged with studio audiences. What
  made these sing-alongs extraordinary, however, was the fact that they inspired
  listeners at home to actively participate in a communal activity. In choosing
  a song repertoire that would speak to and represent America, radio producers
  followed in the footsteps of the pre-World War I community singing activists
  who first sought to institutionalize white, Protestant, middle-class values.
  At the same time, they encouraged nostalgia for an era before the Great
  Depression and international conflict had disrupted middle-class life. The
  proliferation and long life of community singing programs on the air indicates
  that they were successful in constructing a musical vision of America founded
  in the nineteenth-century musical heritage of its white citizens.</p>
  <p>This presentation will focus on the most successful of the radio sing-along
  programs: <i>Gillette Original Community Sing</i>, which broadcast from
  studios in New York City and Philadelphia in 1936 and 1937. This program
  featured a remarkable line-up of celebrity performers, including Milton Berle,
  Wendell Hall, Billy Jones, and Ernie Hare. Although the broadcasts themselves
  were not preserved, the mechanisms and repertoires of the Gillette program
  were recorded in trade press reviews, song books, and visual media. This paper
  examines the Gillette program in the context of community singing practices of
  the previous two decades, with a focus on repertoire. This research relies on
  archival collections at the Library of Congress, the Wisconsin Historical
  Society, and the University of Utah.</p>
