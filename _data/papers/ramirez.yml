title: "‘Make music like a pro’: GarageBand and the Computer as Aspirational Folk Instrument"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>A Steinway on your hard drive, controllable through musical typing. For the
  first time, in 2004, a semi-professional DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) came
  pre-loaded on computers, putting music production tools in the hands of
  unsuspecting users who could now create songs in their leisure time. Apple
  markets the software toward beginners, promising them that they are ready to
  make music “like pros.” This of course assumes that they are not pros.
  Although the software name references rock music, advertisements promise the
  consumer that they can make EDM and Hip-Hop with the program. At the start of
  the century, Renee Lysloff and Leslie Gay called for an ethnomusicology of
  technoculture, “concerned with how technology implicates cultural practices
  involving music.” (2) Meanwhile, Timothy Taylor called digital technology the
  most fundamental change in the history of western music and Attali hoped that
  computers would allow more people to make music for themselves. If computers
  have indeed enabled people to become more musical, what does this musicality
  look and sound like? In what web of meaning are these practices immersed?</p>
  <p>In this paper, I observe the laptop as an aspirational folk instrument; an
  instrument that is readily available to nearly everyone and forms the basis of
  contemporary vernacular forms of music, but which is appealing because of its
  perceived capacity to enable the amateur to <i>sound</i> professional, thus
  transgressing their amateur status. I focus on the case of GarageBand as it is
  the most readily accessible DAW. Building on existing work in technology in
  musicology and ethnomusicology over the past twenty years, I consider how
  GarageBand is used by amateurs and semi-professionals. How does the use of a
  particular computer program inform or relate to a non-musician or musician’s
  view of their own skill and identity as amateurs or aspiring professionals?
  Using a combination of discourse analysis, historical research, and digital
  ethnography, I look at current discourses and narratives about GarageBand as
  they emerge from blogs, instructional videos, tutorials, and forums, and
  consider the degree to which these overlap or conflict with the marketing of
  the program. Through interviews with amateur laptop musicians, producers, and
  DJs who work primarily in GarageBand, I observe how participation in online
  and offline musical communities emerges from the use of the program. </p>
