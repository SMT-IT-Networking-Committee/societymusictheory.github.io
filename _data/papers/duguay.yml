title: "Measuring Physical Balance in Contemporary Piano Works"

abstract: |
    <p>Drawing on Lochhead’s (2016) reconceptualization of structure in
    contemporary music, my paper argues that physical balance works along other
    musical parameters, such as form and pitch, as a mode of structuring
    contemporary works. This approach shifts the analytical focus from the score
    to the pianist’s bodily experience, building on Cusick’s (1994) call for a
    critical engagement with the performing body and on Montague’s (2012) and
    Cizmic’s (2011) emphasis on the pianist’s sensations. To engage with this
    aspect of musical organization, I propose a method for analyzing the sense of
    physical balance—understood as shifts in center of gravity—experienced by a
    pianist. I first outline a methodology that models the way in which recent
    piano repertoire creates tension and resolution for the pianist. This occurs
    through shifts in center of gravity as both hands travel across registers. A
    body experiences a sense of tension when it sits in an unbalanced state,
    leaning, for instance, toward the left of the keyboard. It strives toward
    resolution, which is attained by returning to a balanced center of gravity. I
    then illustrate the methodology through analyses of recent compositions that
    foreground these issues: <i>Dux </i>(2017) by Zosha Di Castri, <i>Garage</i>
    (2007) by Alice Ping Yee Ho, and <i>Klavierstuck II</i> (2004) by Beat
    Furrer.</p>
