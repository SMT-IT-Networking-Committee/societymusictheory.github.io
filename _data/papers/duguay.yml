  <p>From the 1940s to the late 1960s, associations between madness and
  psychedelia—both understood as states of altered consciousness—were common in
  scholarly and popular publications. While the connection between the two
  states has been acknowledged in the field of psychiatry, its implications for
  psychedelic music remain unexplored. For instance, previous studies on Pink
  Floyd have primarily addressed their association with madness, especially
  concerning band member Syd Barrett’s diagnostic history, or the features of
  their music that evoke psychedelia. My paper bridges this gap by exploring how
  sound placement in Pink Floyd’s debut album <i>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
  </i>(1967) testifies to the fluid boundary between madness and
  psychedelia.</p>
  <p>I preface my analysis with an overview of contemporary ideas on madness and
  their interaction with cultural conceptualizations of psychedelia. Proponents
  of the anti-psychiatry movement such as R. D. Laing, well-known in Pink
  Floyd’s entourage, understood madness as an inner journey towards
  self-discovery, a notion that resonated with psychedelic ideals. Pink Floyd’s
  interest in musically projecting an “inner space” is apparent in interviews
  and in the all-encompassing sensory experience of their live performances.
  Using sound-box analyses (Dockwray & Moore 2010) that visually represent
  instrument placement, I show how the stereo version of <i>Piper, </i>through
  its projection of a non-normative space,<i> </i>invites an idiosyncratic
  listening experience marked as both mad and psychedelic. This experience
  occurs through the disruption of the mix’s stability and conflicting musical
  cues emanating from various places in the sound-box.</p>
