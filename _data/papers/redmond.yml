handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In his “Ode to Paul Robeson,” Chilean poet and political icon Pablo Neruda
  developed a theory of time marked by a voice that was “divided from the
  silence.” The repetition of Robeson’s voice in moments marked by danger,
  uncertainty, and violence are signaled by Neruda’s repeated use of “again” to
  open his stanzas. Robeson’s frequency is marked by Neruda as the indomitable
  power by which his presence is sustained with and by people the world over. He
  comes back through this repetition and calling, being presently useful to
  communities from whom he may be many decades removed. This paper will
  investigate frequency as an artscience uniquely enlivened by Black music(ians)
  in order to account for the various ways in which the sounds and voices
  constitutive of it/them return. Robeson is the animating figure in this effort
  due to his practice of antiphonal life, which is built by an archive of
  recordings and performances that dismiss the fiction of dead and gone.</p>
