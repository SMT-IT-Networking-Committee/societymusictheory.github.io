title: "The Battle Coda in Viennese Waltzes of the Napoleonic Era"

abstract: |
  <p>Commentators have frequently noted a tendency in some Viennese dance music
  of the later nineteenth century to bridge the functions of music for dancing
  and music for the concert hall, and of the categories of art music and
  “entertainment” music. Yet several waltzes composed for Viennese ballroom
  during and shortly after the Napoleonic Wars by Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1807
  and 1821) and Friedrich Starke (1815) involve similar crossovers of genre and
  function in their extensive battle codas. Whereas allusions to military topics
  were relatively commonplace in Viennese dance music of the late eighteenth
  century, these battle codas differ in that they cannot be danced to, and
  contain coherent “battle” narratives that demonstrate clear affinity with the
  genre of the characteristic symphony. Hummel’s 1821 coda even suggests a
  particular indebtedness to Beethoven’s <i>Wellingtons Sieg</i> in its overall
  design and narrative, in which French forces are pitted against the British
  and the work culminates with a triumphant extended fugato passage.</p>
  <p>These little-known waltz sets cast light on several aspects of Viennese
  musical culture of the early nineteenth century. They mark a geographical
  shift in musical representations of war from East (with “alla Turca” and
  Hungarian idioms) to West (with depictions of the French and British), thereby
  providing evidence of how awareness of contemporary military events featured
  in everyday cultural life. As “crossover” works they can also inform our
  understanding of contemporary perceptions of musical functions and aesthetics.
  While these works clearly bridge the gap between the dance hall and the
  concert hall, they do not yet demonstrate a strong polarisation between the
  later nineteenth-century categories of entertainment music and serious music.
  As such, they support the notion that Viennese public concert culture was not
  yet dominated by an “absolute-music” aesthetic, regardless of the well-known
  developments in contemporary music criticism.</p>
