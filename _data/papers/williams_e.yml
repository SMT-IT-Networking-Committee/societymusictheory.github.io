  <p>When Denis Diderot posited that the philosopher is a kind of harpsichord—a
  “sensitive instrument” susceptible to sympathetic resonance—he was not
  concerned only with cognition: sexual reproduction was at stake, too. As he
  develops his metaphor of the “human harpsichord” (<i>l’homme clavecin</i>) in
  <i>Le rêve de d’Alembert</i>, Diderot imagines how this sentient harpsichord
  might reproduce: “it would live and breed of itself, or with its female,
  little harpsichords, also living and vibrating.”</p>
  <p>A musical moment within Diderot’s vitalist-materialist project, the human
  harpsichord metaphor has recently garnered attention for its relevance to
  theoretical concerns with instrumentality and the agential capacity of
  material things. But the hypothetical claim that <i>l’homme clavecin</i> might
  reproduce itself has not been taken seriously as a philosophical problem in
  its own right; and the questions of gender, sexual difference, and sensible
  desire it raises have consequently been passed over in silence.</p>
  <p>I argue that the human harpsichord, and conceptions of vital materiality
  more generally, stand in an ambivalent relation with gendered reproductive
  labor: assigning vitality as a general property of matter simultaneously draws
  upon and undermines elisions between materiality, the female, and reproductive
  generativity. To make this argument, I place <i>Le rêve de d’Alembert</i> in
  dialogue with two depictions of harpsichord-playing in Diderot’s oeuvre: the
  fictionalized account of his daughter’s harpsichord lessons in the <i>Leçons
  de Clavecin</i> and the account of a nun’s same-sex seduction by her mother
  superior in <i>La religieuse.</i> The <i>Leçons de clavecin</i> reveals how
  sonic sensibility was constituted in relation to the reproductive labor of
  heterosexual marriage, in preparation for which musical training formed a
  symbolic dowry. <i>La religieuse</i>, on the other hand, locates in the
  homosocial space of a nunnery a queer experience of musical pleasure—the
  possibility of which is latently present in all sensible matter. Ultimately,
  the three texts transform the <i>l’homme clavecin</i> into an ambiguously
  sexed <i>femme clavecin.</i> And, read together with Elizabeth Grosz and Rosi
  Braidotti’s anti-essentialist ontologies of sexual difference, they suggest
  that our own theories of materiality cannot be separated from the ways that
  materiality is gendered and gender is materialized.</p>
