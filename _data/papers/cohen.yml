title: "‘The Source of All Intervals’: Rameau’s Pythagorean Octave and the Basis of Harmonic Analysis"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Rameau’s <i>Traité de l’harmonie</i> of 1722 established two principles
  still foundational to our understanding of tonal harmony: First, that each
  chord has a “fundamental,” a root. Second, that chords are invertible, a
  doctrine Rameau justifies by positing a strong interpretation of “octave
  equivalence.” As I show, the latter entails a flouting of basic facts of tonal
  practice by implying full functional identity between “inverted” chords and
  their “root positions,” while an implicit incompatibility between the two
  principles themselves constitutes a profound and pervasive self-contradiction
  that persists, latent, in harmonic theory down to our own time.</p>
  <p>I then examine Rameau’s arguments in the <i>Traité</i> meant to support his
  strong interpretation of octave equivalence. These rely heavily on ideas
  concerning numbers and ratios that are unmistakably Pythagorean in origin,
  emblematized by a passage that Rameau paraphrases from Zarlino in which the
  octave is celebrated as “the source . . . of all intervals,” which Zarlino
  found in Marsilio Ficino’s fifteenth-century Neoplatonic commentary on the
  <i>Epinomis,</i> a pseudo-Platonic dialogue deeply impregnated by Pythagorean
  beliefs.</p>
  <p>Rameau’s recourse to such atavistic ideas to buttress and justify so
  essential a component of his harmonic theory as chordal inversion poses a
  challenge to the received view of his theorizing as exemplary of Enlightenment
  thought. Coupled with the profound self-contradiction at the very core of
  Rameau’s harmonic theories—and hence of our own—these considerations may serve
  as yet another reminder of the provisional and historically conditioned
  character even of those ideas the “truth” of which we most reflexively
  accept.</p>
