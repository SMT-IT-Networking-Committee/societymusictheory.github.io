        <p>David E. Cohen researches the history of music theory from Greek antiquity through the nineteenth century. He is currently a Senior Research Scientist with the research group, “Histories of Music, Mind, and Body” at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt. He has held professorships at Tufts, Harvard, and Columbia Universities, and visiting professorships at Yale and McGill. His article, “‘The Imperfect Seeks its Perfection’: Harmonic Progression, Directed Motion, and Aristotelian Physics” won the 2001 Best Publication award of the Society for Music Theory. His current principal writing project is a book, <em>Rameau Before the Enlightenment: The</em> Traité de l’harmonie <em>and the Origins of Modern Harmonic Theory.</em></p>

abstract: |
    <p>Descartes’ early <em>Compendium of Music</em> begins by arguing that the senses can take “delight” only in objects which, because they exhibit simple proportional relations, are perceived “distinctly.” Our minds, he holds, are inevitably deceived by proportions of excessive complexity, such as those involving irrational quantities, which “can in no way be perfectly known … to perception.” Thus—as the eminent Descartes scholar Stephen Gaukroger has observed—right from the start we find Descartes treating as foundational a version of what will later, in his most celebrated and influential writings, constitute the epistemological foundation of the <em>Cogito</em>: those mental entities or events that he comes to call “clear and distinct” ideas or perceptions.</p>
    <p>As I go on to show, much the same concern for clarity and simplicity—for immediate, effortless intellectual perspicuity—had for centuries before Descartes played an equally crucial role in precisely <em>this</em> domain of intellectual endeavor, the “Pythagorean,” mathematical theory of music. In discussing these points, I focus on the philosophical reasons why mathematical music theory—<em>unlike</em> geometry—from antiquity through early modernity had always rejected the irrational in favor exclusively of rational quantities, and had moreover sometimes regarded <em>as</em> “irrational” certain proportions that are in fact not so. I thus identify an idiosyncratic “Pythagorean” form of “rationality,” whose lifespan extended from antiquity into at least the seventeenth century, when, transmuted by the alembic of Descartes’ thought, it came to play an unlooked-for role in the foundation of modern philosophy.</p>
