abstract: | 
    <p>Northern Italy between 1482 and 1558 witnessed a music-theoretical revolution reflective of contemporaneous practices in composition and performance: the ancient “Pythagorean” tuning system, in which imperfect consonances sound quite harsh, gave way to what we call “just intonation,” in which those same concords sound “sweet” and harmonious. </p>
    <p>Directly relevant to these developments are ideas expressed by the great Florentine Neoplatonist philosopher and translator of Plato, Marsilio Ficino (1433-99). Ficino’s discussions of music theory have heretofore been studied principally in connection with his commentary on the <em>Timaeus</em>, where it is chiefly the Pythagorean system that is in view. But in a letter of 1484 offering a “rational explanation of music” (<em>De rationibus musicae</em>), the theoretical interest of which has thus far been insufficiently appreciated, Ficino—possibly influenced by Ramos de Pareia—effectively anticipates the advent of just intonation. </p>
    <p>Ficino there also introduces several other innovative music-theoretical ideas, including an image of the scale with its steps plotted against the curve of an ovoid figure as a representation of intra-scalar relations; the latter are conceived in an unprecedented manner that strikingly anticipates theoretical concepts otherwise known only from much later sources. </p>
    <p>This paper examines the innovative theoretical ideas expressed in this letter of Ficino, placing them in the context of contemporaneous theory and compositional practice, and considering, via their indebtedness to Neopythagorean metaphysics, their possible relation to a crucial aspect of Ficino’s philosophical thought, the theme of the soul’s “reversion” (<em>conversio</em>) to itself and (thereby) to its divine source, the Neoplatonic One.</p>
