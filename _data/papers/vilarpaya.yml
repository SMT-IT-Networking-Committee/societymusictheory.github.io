  <p>When Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza arrived in New Spain (Mexico) in
  1640, Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (ca.1590–1664) was already a renowned chapel
  master at the church that then served as Puebla’s cathedral. Palafox came with
  a reformation agenda that faced bitter opposition as it drastically challenged
  the status quo of civil and religious institutions. As <i>Visitador
  General</i> he reported cases of governmental mismanagement to the king of
  Spain; as Bishop he withheld permissions to priests and churches that didn’t
  comply with his strict ordinances. In 1647, Viceroy Sarmiento and high-ranking
  priests of different orders joined forces against Palafox; his closest
  supporters were incarcerated while he and Juan de Merlo—a Canon from the
  cathedral of Puebla—were excommunicated by conservative Novohispanic
  inquisitors. Pope Innocent X and Philip IV rebuked the verdict, but Palafox’s
  adversaries persevered, alleging that his support for creoles, mestizos and
  natives was causing revolts, even suggesting independence. The king abandoned
  his own reformation ideals for fear of losing valuable American assets and
  Palafox was ordered to return to Spain. In a letter to Innocent X, the Bishop
  described his forthcoming journey to Europe as an exile. Nevertheless, just
  before his departure, Palafox organized two weeks of spectacular religious
  celebrations and feasts linked to the consecration of the new cathedral. </p>
  <p>Palafox had reactivated the stalled plans to finish the sumptuous temple
  that we know now as Pueblás cathedral. A detailed contemporary chronicle by
  Antonio Tamariz describes its consecration in 1649.This presentation discusses
  the numerous points of intersection that arise between Tamariz’s chronicle,
  the liturgical calendar, and the repertoire of a set of seventeenth-century
  choral parts containing Padilla’s music and preserved in the cathedral’s
  musical archive. Moreover, I will show how the Bishop’s political conflicts
  explain Padilla’s selection of liturgical texts and text setting: a notable
  emphasis on <i>Tu es sacerdos in aeternum</i> (from the psalm <i>Dixit
  Dominus</i>), and how the somewhat unusual choices for <i>Redime me a
  calumniis hominum</i> and <i>Exitus aquarum deduxerunt oculi mei</i> (from
  <i>Mirabilia testimonia tua</i>) relate to Tamariz’s description of Palafox’s
  farewell mass and sermon.</p>
