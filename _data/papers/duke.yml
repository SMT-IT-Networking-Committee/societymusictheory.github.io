  <p>In Wagner’s music dramas, a fundamental challenge for Schenkerian analysis
  is to reconcile the method’s presumption of closed musical structures with the
  music’s resistance to rigid formal segmentation. This paper addresses that
  challenge by treating the viability of Schenkerian interpretations as an
  analytical focal point. Drawing especially from the work of Anthony Newcomb
  (1981) and Karol Berger (2017), I argue that even the set pieces in Wagner’s
  music dramas frequently resist unification because they are prone to
  directional shifts in service of both musical and dramatic effects. A
  Schenkerian sketch, by convention, bears an implicit claim of unity and
  continuity, but in the case of the <i>Ring</i>, a voice-leading analysis
  becomes more evocative when it communicates the elements of disunity and
  discontinuity underneath the tonal framework.</p>
  <p>This approach thus posits and questions Schenkerian structures by asking
  what musical or affective characteristics those structures represent. Through
  three analytical examples, I explore three issues of interpretation (with some
  overlap): the plausibility and meaning of middleground <i>Stufen</i> when they
  lack the support of higher or lower structural levels, the role of melodic and
  metrical continuity in the analysis of tonal structure, and the possibility of
  a “failed” structure whose very unraveling constitutes an essential part of
  its musical form. The analyses are framed by (and also support) two main
  theoretical points: the viability of a Schenkerian structure is a matter of
  degree, and an unviable interpretation can be just as analytically useful as a
  viable one.</p>
