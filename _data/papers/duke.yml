        <p>Craig Duke is a Doctoral Candidate in Music Theory at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. His main research interest is in the analysis of temporal organization and continuity in music that is combined with other media, and his most recent work studies conventions and innovations in techniques for combining music with dramatic action and dialogue in mid-19<sup>th</sup>-century opera. Currently, he is writing a dissertation on Richard Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> cycle from this multimedia-oriented perspective. In the future, he plans to study similar aspects of modern multimedia genres such as film and television music and video-game music. He has also presented research on Schenkerian analysis in Wagnerian music drama and on English folk-inspired music of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. This paper was previously presented at this year’s virtual conference of the Music Theory Society of New York State and will also be presented at next year’s International Conference on Musical Form in Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.</p>

    <p>There is growing recognition that Richard Wagner’s mature music dramas owed much to earlier 19th-century opera, but many of the analytical implications of this knowledge remain to be explored. This paper examines one specific generic connection: lyric form (AABA or AABC), an Italian model for short, unified, expressive monologues. As I show through three examples, Wagner continues to use lyric form in <em>Das Rheingold</em> in a largely traditional (albeit flexible) way. While many of Wagner’s own writings emphasize his departure from the genre of opera, lyric form is actually compatible with the radical aesthetic of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> because it is, by its very generic identity, a synthesis of musical and rhetorical organization. The novelty of Wagner’s usage comes in part from his vigorous commitment to dramatic verisimilitude: every lyric-form monologue is “realistically” integrated into a conversation (i.e., it is not a soliloquy), in order to maintain a strong sense of dramatic continuity.</p>
    <p>Seen from this perspective, the overarching music-dramatic function of a lyric form lies mainly in the communicative aims of its speaker. In all three of the examples I discuss, the monologue is <em>performative</em> in J. L. Austin’s sense: its communicative purpose extends beyond its verbal content. Drawing from work by Edward Cone and Peter Kivy, I call these situations <em>semidiegetic</em> because the music can be heard as a representation of the performative dimension of a character’s speech, even when that character is not “literally” singing within the story.</p>
