    <p>There is growing recognition that Richard Wagner’s mature music dramas owed much to earlier 19th-century opera, but many of the analytical implications of this knowledge remain to be explored. This paper examines one specific generic connection: lyric form (AABA or AABC), an Italian model for short, unified, expressive monologues. As I show through three examples, Wagner continues to use lyric form in <em>Das Rheingold</em> in a largely traditional (albeit flexible) way. While many of Wagner’s own writings emphasize his departure from the genre of opera, lyric form is actually compatible with the radical aesthetic of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> because it is, by its very generic identity, a synthesis of musical and rhetorical organization. The novelty of Wagner’s usage comes in part from his vigorous commitment to dramatic verisimilitude: every lyric-form monologue is “realistically” integrated into a conversation (i.e., it is not a soliloquy), in order to maintain a strong sense of dramatic continuity.</p>
    <p>Seen from this perspective, the overarching music-dramatic function of a lyric form lies mainly in the communicative aims of its speaker. In all three of the examples I discuss, the monologue is <em>performative</em> in J. L. Austin’s sense: its communicative purpose extends beyond its verbal content. Drawing from work by Edward Cone and Peter Kivy, I call these situations <em>semidiegetic</em> because the music can be heard as a representation of the performative dimension of a character’s speech, even when that character is not “literally” singing within the story.</p>
