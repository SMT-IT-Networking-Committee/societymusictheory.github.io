abstract: |
  <p>In this paper, I examine how Chen Yi (b. 1953) forges a transnational
  compositional voice of her own. From childhood, she was bicultural: immersed
  in Cantonese, a tonal language, and exposed to the Western European musical
  canon, especially major violin repertoire. Before coming to the United States,
  she had already expanded her timbral palette with additional sounds that
  emerge from her ethnic heritage, discovered during her encounter with farmers
  during the Cultural Revolution; while leading the orchestra of a Beijing Opera
  troupe for eight years; and at the Beijing Central Conservatory of Music,
  where she engaged in systematic classroom study of Chinese folk music,
  supplemented by field trips to rural villages. </p>
  <p>Building on ideas in the essay collection <i>Vocal Music and Contemporary
  Identities</i> and especially the work of Frederick Lau (“Voice, Culture, and
  Ethnicity”), I focus on Chen’s compositional strategies related to text and
  voice. Her use of <i>chenci</i>, expressive syllables or vocables without
  specific meaning, frees listeners from linguistic barriers and dismantles
  boundaries between music of China and the West. Chenci occur in folk songs
  across China, are distinct to each ethnic minority, and are unrelated to the
  lyrics of folk songs. In the seven-movement <i>From the Path of Beauty</i>
  (2008), a joint commission by Chanticleer and the Shanghai String Quartet,
  Chen avoids prompting a predisposition toward concrete meanings by exclusively
  using vocables rather than words in any language. Chen’s selection of phonemes
  forms an integral element of timbre, articulation, and texture as syllables
  are associated with specific musical ideas and contribute to the expressive
  content of the music. Her use of extreme ranges is another aspect that
  contributes to Chen’s expressive vocabulary of vocal timbres, which subverts
  dominant Western signification of beautiful bel canto singing and creates a
  counter narrative, linked with a transnational aesthetic.</p>
  <p>Given Chen Yi’s prominence on the US and global stages, an examination of
  her work seeking to understand how she articulates a new transnational vision
  of her Chinese-American identity is crucial.</p>
