abstract: | 
    <p>Willaert’s counterpoint in the <em>Musica Nova</em> has been described as “elusive” because it “eschews” clear-cut imitation, cadences, and contrasts of texture (Fromson 2001; also Feldman 1995). I argue that to articulate structure, Willaert substitutes five contrasting contrapuntal procedures. These are <em>progressively linked soggetti, mixed soggetti, contrapunto fugato, repeating blocks, and quodlibet</em>, which I will illustrate with an analysis of “Io mi rovolgo” from <em>Musica Nova</em> (1559). Unlike most madrigal studies, which begin and end with text-music relations, my discussion is grounded in the notion that music is a semiotic system independent of any sung text (Agawu 1992; Monelle 2010), and that the musical features of Willaert’s madrigal music may fruitfully be discussed before referring to its marriage with the text. The musical examples in Renaissance counterpoint treatises are always given without text, implying that music has its own laws that continue to obtain even as the composer sets a text. They create a world parallel to that of the text. </p>
