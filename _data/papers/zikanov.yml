abstract: |
    <p>Glinka’s significance as a composer of instrumental music is typically
    ascribed to the ostinato-variation technique that he employed in
    <i>Kamarinskaia</i> (1848), where a short melody is repeated while the
    texture around it is varied. This technique was subsequently taken up by
    multiple generations of Russian composers, and has commonly been viewed as
    the antithesis to Germanic ideals of motivic development. Yet
    <i>Kamarinskaia</i> is not the only instrumental composition in which
    Glinka employed this technique; rather it also appears in his two Spanish
    fantasias, <i>Jota Aragonesa</i> (1845) and <i>Souvenir d’une nuit d’été à
    Madrid</i> (1851). Indeed, it was the Spanish fantasias that most strongly
    captured the attention of Russian composers and critics in the late
    nineteenth century. Not only did many Russian musicians privilege the
    Spanish fantasias over <i>Kamarinskaia</i>, but they also went to great
    lengths to interpret all three compositions as paragons of musical
    organicism, relying on decidedly Germanic conceptualizations of what such
    organicism entails.</p>

    <p>In my talk, I investigate the organicist discourse surrounding Glinka’s
    three fantasias in the 1850s, focusing on the writings of Alexander Serov,
    Vladimir Stasov and Felix Draeseke. In particular, I demonstrate that
    these critics interpreted the fantasias through Adolf Bernhard Marx’s
    conception of musical organicism, which emphasizes an epigenetic
    relationship between the motivic material and its temporal development.
    Moreover, they noted that notwithstanding the three fantasias’ shared
    variational tendencies, each composition represents a distinct approach to
    musical form. These observations in turn serve as a foundation for my own
    analytical exploration of Glinka’s formal techniques.</p>
