title: "Young Thug: Vocal Delivery and Musical Expression towards a New Rap Aesthetic"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Young Thug has been established as one of rap’s most contentious and
    polarizing figures—while many dismiss his music as absurd, others argue that
    he is a trailblazing artist. Those who are drawn to him note his unique vocal
    style in relation to expressivity, as his flow is characterized by
    deliberately unclear delivery, a diction consistent with “reduced speech,” and
    meaningless neologisms. In this study, I argue that Young Thug’s expression
    and vocal delivery reflect a departure from traditional notions of
    communication in rap music, where meaning lies with the artist. Young Thug’s
    new musical aesthetic, I contend, transfers the onus of communication and
    creates a new interpretive role for the listener.</p>
