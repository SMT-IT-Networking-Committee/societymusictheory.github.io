  <p>In 1568 Sigmund Feyerabend published the <i>Eygentliche Beschreibung Aller
  Stände auff Erden</i> in Frankfurt. The <i>Ständebuch</i> is a collection of
  114 woodcuts by Jost Amman (1539–91) and his workshop purporting to illustrate
  the full scope of human occupations, each accompanied by a short poem
  attributed to Hans Sachs. Ranging from the Pope to the Fool, the main emphasis
  is on professional trades and artisanal crafts, including various
  instrumentalists and instrument-makers. The book functions as a moral exemplar
  of industry, a depiction of social hierarchies, and a display of the
  woodcutter’s art. More striking than the instrumentalists is <i>Die
  Singer</i>, an idiosyncratic depiction of recreational singers that has
  received little scholarly attention. Sach’s accompanying poem describes a song
  in four parts with a “schön höfflichen Text”—that is, a madrigal or polyphonic
  lied. Yet the woodcut image depicts something rather different: three
  heterosexual couples are seated around a table under an outdoor canopy: the
  men embrace their companions, and each pair shares a single partbook. The
  clearly labeled Bass book and a fifth partbook lie unopened on the table.
  Whatever these figures are doing, they cannot be singing the four-part music
  described in the poem. Lindmayer-Brandl (2011) raises the possibility that
  Sachs knew only the titles of the woodcuts when he wrote the poems, and not
  their specific imagery; yet when the <i>Ständebuch</i> was reissued in a Latin
  edition by Hartmann Schopper later in 1568 the new poem, “Cantores,” again
  describes a four-part song. Nor can the woodcut explained as a simple
  genre-image like others in the <i>Ständebuch</i>: those illustrations conform
  to conventions common in Amman’s broader work, while <i>Die Singer</i> is
  unique in both subject matter and compositional style. The image’s eroticism
  and disregard for musical propriety—and its publication in a book depicting
  “all the professions in the world”—suggest a different kind of occupation
  altogether: that of the sexually available courtesan. This paper
  contextualizes <i>Die Singer</i> within the <i>Ständebuch</i> and Amman’s work
  generally, and proposes ways of approaching the verbal and visual dissonances
  in Sach’s poem and Amman’s image.</p>
