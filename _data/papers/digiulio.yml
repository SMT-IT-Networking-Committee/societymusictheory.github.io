    <p>Whilst research underlines both the importance of music and the role of play in early childhood, little attention has been directed to finding out how to constructively use playing activities to teach complex concepts in music theory. Quite a few studies show that informal, non-structured, elementary musical activities can boost the entire development of a child in early years (Gordon 2003). In addition, recent studies effectively demonstrate that the most successful pedagogical approaches are centered on a play-based methodology in the form of semi-structured and guided activities (Weisberg, Hirsh-Pasek, and Golinkoff 2013).</p>
    <p>Following Bruner’s three modes of conceptual development (Bruner 1957), my presentation will explore ways to integrate structured and unstructured learning of music theory concepts in early childhood music classes. During the enactive learning activities, students will manipulate the sources of sounds. In the iconic phase, sounds are represented through images, pictures and drawings to finally transition then in the symbolic phase, during which abstract symbols are used to identify specific sections and define musical form.</p>
    <p>For years, generations of more or less trained music educators have focused on directly “teaching” music theory to young kids, often referring to music theory as an abstract and difficult science. If we would like to go with the idea that music should just be part of human society and with the idea that music theory is simply the study of music, we should seek new and innovative methods to teach music theory in playful, but also effective ways.</p>
