  <p>“It’s the only music that brings people to their senses” —Joe Cooley,
  1973</p>
  <p>Irish traditional musicians frequently invoke this one-liner from accordion
  player Joe Cooley (1924–73) to explain the attraction of “the music itself.”
  Using Cooley’s statement as inspiration, this paper considers how the sensory
  experience of playing Irish traditional music (“trad”) intersects with
  discourses of “the music itself” in both trad and Western art music. It
  combines theoretical discussions of music and ineffability begun by
  Jankélévich, Abbate, and others with ethnographic interviews to explore the
  relationships between embodied experience and discourses of “the music itself”
  that simultaneously confine and liberate practitioners of Irish traditional
  music. It attends especially to those whose gendered, sexed, and/or raced
  bodies differ from the white, straight, and male majority in the genre.</p>
  <p>I begin by tracing intersections between trad and art music claims about
  the power of musical sound. These similarities—particularly around the concept
  of ineffability—remind us that despite tensions between the two, the playing,
  listening, thinking, reading, and writing public of Irish traditional music
  has shared personnel, texts, and contexts with the Western art music public
  for centuries. I then explore the inseparability of drastic and gnostic modes
  in Irish traditional music performance. Ethnographic interviews demonstrate
  that although trad practitioners usually eschew written notation, they treat
  performance as a legible text to be learned and assessed even as they describe
  their most transcendent encounters with “the music” as beyond
  explanation—illegible by definition and often only obliquely about musical
  sound. Finally, I address the imbalance of power inherent in invoking “the
  music itself” as a way to control discourse, especially around discussions of
  race, gender, and sexuality—thus contributing to ongoing conversations about
  inclusion and equity in music performance and scholarship. By blending
  musicological and ethnomusicological approaches, this paper demonstrates ways
  the two disciplines might productively speak. It also offers insights about
  performance as a set of relationships among musical and extramusical sound,
  bodily sensation, and perceptions of space and time—a complex interaction that
  exceeds simple classification as a “flow state.”</p>
