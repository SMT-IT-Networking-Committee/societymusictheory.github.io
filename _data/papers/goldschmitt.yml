abstract: |
  <p>The political climate in Brazil changed dramatically in 1968 as resentment
  toward the military regime reached a climax; labor and student strikes broke
  out across the country and in response, the military regime imposed the
  extensive and oppressive Fifth Institutional Act. What was supposed to be a
  short-term military takeover of the government had become a dictatorship with
  disappearances and widespread censorship. Brazilian music histories center the
  music of 1968 on the experimental ruptures engendered by the Tropicália
  movement and the eventual forced exile of numerous popular music artists,
  especially Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. However, these changes began when
  bossa nova musicians chose not to return after the 1964 coup while some who
  remained in Brazil incorporated more regional sounds to evoke the protest
  spirit. </p>
  <p>This presentation uncovers how Brazilian music from 1968 was received by
  English-speaking audiences who were largely unaware of the political turbulence
  unfolding in Brazil. That year, pianist and bandleader Sérgio Mendes crossed
  over from jazz to the popular mainstream following an appearance on the
  fortieth Academy Awards telecast. There, he and his band Brasil ’66 performed
  “The Look of Love,” a bossa nova song by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the
  James Bond spoof <i>Casino Royale</i> (1967). Most of Mendes’s subsequent
  success on the pop charts was based on his “latin pop” approach to English
  language pop songs as well as songs by Brazilian artists known to be
  participating in protests against the military dictatorship, such as Edu Lobo
  and Baden Powell. Yet, due to the presentation and arrangement of these songs,
  Mendes’s recordings were largely received as apolitical. Through a detailed
  exploration of the reception of his recorded output in top music periodicals of
  the time, including <i>Billboard</i> and <i>Melody Maker</i>, this presentation
  demonstrates how the political meaning of these songs was transformed in their
  delivery to English-speaking audiences. As we take stock of the widespread
  transformations that occurred in 1968, scholars need to pay heed to how musical
  protest was limited and altered by linguistic and musical markers.</p>
