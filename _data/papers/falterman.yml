    <p>Although our tools for analyzing variation or sonata forms on their own have become increasingly nuanced over the last two decades, methods for studying the interactions between the two have typically relied on customized analytical systems specially designed for specific composers or pieces (Ivanovitch 2010; Martinkus 2017). This paper develops an analytical system potentially applicable to <em>any</em> sonata-variation hybrid by generalizing Vande Moortele’s (2009) “two-dimensional sonata form” and supplementing it with important contributions from Schmalfeldt (2011). I first reframe Vande Moortele’s two dimensions as “sonata form” and “variation form,” enabling me to apply his useful categories of “interpolated” and “double-functional” formal units to this music. In addition, more thoroughly integrating Schmalfeldt’s becoming principle allows the two dimensions to more flexibly permeate one another. I then demonstrate the applicability of this generalized two-dimensional perspective through a detailed analysis of two crucial passages in Chopin’s Fourth Piano Ballade, both of which incorporate techniques of retrospective reinterpretation across the dimensional divide of sonata and variation forms.</p>
    <p>A fully generalized multi-dimensional approach would provide a dedicated analytical framework for studying pieces that combine any two (or more) formal types. Though a full treatment is beyond the scope of this paper, I conclude with some brief speculations about the potential of this approach in analyzing other hybrid formal types, such as sonata-rondo form.</p>
