abstract: |
  <p>The most pervasive example of musical borrowing in the Renaissance is the
  song-mass (e.g., <i>Missa L’homme armé, Missa Se la face ay pale). </i>For
  decades the field has been gripped by questions about how this tradition began
  and what it tells us about religious culture. But one thing is clear: on their
  own terms, songs and masses differ fundamentally from one another. Songs are
  small in scope, they set vernacular lyrics about love, and circulate in sources
  comprised primarily of secular music. Masses are lengthy liturgical works
  divided into discrete sections that circulate mainly in large manuscripts with
  other sacred music.</p>
  <p>In making sense of the generic chasm that is built into the song-mass,
  Michael Long, Jennifer Bloxam, David Rothenberg, and Anne Walters Robertson
  have sought to account for the ways in which the secular meaning of songs could
  coalesce with the sacred world of the mass. In each case, the earthliness of
  vernacular song is raised up into the context of the mass.<i> </i>Whereas the
  song is made sacred through “translation,” “transportation,” or “elevation,”
  the mass is never secularized by the presence of the song. </p>
  <p>But in the realm of circulation the opposite occurred: an extensive
  investigation reveals that in fully forty-five cases, portions of masses were
  subsumed into songbooks. The magnitude and implications of this phenomenon have
  not yet been fully appreciated. Examining these pieces together reveals a
  consistent set of conventions: only masses based on songs (not chant) are
  copied; only certain mass subsections are absorbed; and they are almost never
  identified by their original liturgical text.<i> </i>Masquerading in this
  fashion, these mass sections were clearly<i> not</i> intended for devotional
  use. On the contrary, their textual and material circumstances effectively
  transformed them into secular songs. This phenomenon not only contradicts our
  understanding of generic relationships and hierarchies, but also invites a more
  nuanced perspective on the porousness of vernacular traditions and liturgical
  devotion in the Renaissance. </p>
