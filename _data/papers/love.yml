abstract: |
  <p>During the 1985 Grammy Awards, Pepsi-Cola attempted to secure its edge on
  the market by featuring Lionel Richie in a three-minute barrage of spectacle,
  sentimentality, and product placement. The new campaign touted Richie’s style,
  compassion, and family values with soundtracks that emulated his solo hits.
  The following year, Pepsi took advantage of new developments in computer
  graphics to place Tina Turner in virtual duets with international stars for a
  global campaign that resembled her single and video for “Show Me Some Respect”
  (1984). In 1987, the brand positioned Turner alongside David Bowie to sing a
  reworked version of his “Modern Love” (1983) over scenes of a Pepsi-swigging
  scientist who creates the perfect woman with his computer. As I argue in this
  paper, it was not the mere presence of these musical celebrities that made
  Pepsi’s mid-1980s “The Choice of a New Generation” campaigns extraordinary,
  but the fact that the brand wielded their iconic music and images to
  communicate developing US political agendas—in this case, the representation
  of America’s ideal, late-capitalist consumer. Indeed, these stars modeled the
  qualities that would characterize Pepsi’s “new generation” of customers as
  autonomous, upwardly mobile, family oriented, dazzled by spectacle, globally
  minded, and technologically savvy. </p>
  <p>This paper integrates close analysis, primary sources, and
  interdisciplinary theories of neoliberalism by David Harvey, Timothy Taylor,
  Marianna Ritchey, and others, to demonstrate how Pepsi used pop celebrities to
  market the potential of the new neoliberal individual as defined by President
  Reagan’s economic policies. This essay also reveals the tension between the
  brand’s celebration of market activity and the realities it imposed: Although
  Pepsi’s promises of “freedom” and “choice” should have aligned with neoliberal
  ideologies, the fact that these commercials received only moderate success
  exhibits the complexities of the cultural work necessary for persuading
  audiences at a time when the advertising industry was struggling to navigate
  new technologies and evolving aesthetic tastes in an increasingly competitive
  global marketplace. This paper contributes to recent work on
  twenty-first-century musical branding by showing how Pepsi’s mid-1980s
  pop-themed commercials offer an early sonic blueprint of advertising’s
  integration and negotiation of neoliberal values.</p>
