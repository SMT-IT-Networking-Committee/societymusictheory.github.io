abstract: |
  <p>This paper examines Margaret Glyn’s <i>The Rhythmic Conception of
  Music</i>, published in England in 1907. Although she has been largely
  forgotten today, in her time Glyn was something of a musical polymath: in
  addition to her theoretical writing, she composed numerous solo, chamber, and
  orchestral works, published one of the first scholarly books about sixteenth-
  and seventeenth-century English keyboard music, and completed editions of
  keyboard works by Bull, Gibbons, Weelkes, and others.</p>
  <p>My paper is organized into two parts. The first part provides information
  about the treatise itself. Aside from being a rare example of speculative
  theoretical work written by a woman, the treatise is noteworthy for its
  connections to contemporaneous intellectual trends in Britain (particularly
  the evolutionary theories of Herbert Spencer), its emphasis on emotion as a
  generative force in music, and its comments about Wagner’s compositional
  style. The second section of the paper examines the contextual forces
  surrounding the treatise’s publication. I draw on work on women musicians and
  class by Reich (1993), as well as primary-source materials from archives in
  the British Library, Surrey History Centre, and the Epsom and Ewell Local and
  Family History Centre (Glyn’s family lived in Ewell for many generations) to
  discuss how Glyn’s status as a wealthy woman granted her a degree of privilege
  and access that made it possible for her to write music theory. Glyn’s
  contemporary Virginia Woolf famously described how women need financial
  security and independence (“five hundred a year and a room of one’s own”) in
  order to write; Glyn’s upper-class status afforded her the means and freedom
  to pursue the task of authoring a music theory treatise, even as a woman.</p>
