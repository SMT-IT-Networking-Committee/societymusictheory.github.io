abstract: |
  <p>Recent interpretations of Berlioz cast him as a liberal republican (Barzun
  2003) or as a Bonapartist (Rushton 2003). But determining Berlioz’s position
  on the political spectrum is less important than engaging with the effects of
  his “political” music; he both exemplifies multiple political persuasions
  simultaneously and fulfills equally diverse purposes in his 1830 arrangement
  of <i>La Marseillaise</i>, the 1835 cantata on the death of Napoleon, <i>Le
  Cinq Mai</i>, and the 1855 exaltation of Emperor Napoleon III,
  <i>L’Imperiale</i>. Meanwhile, Berlioz’s “architectural” or “monumental”
  works, described by Macdonald (1982), Cairns (2000), and Locke (2000),
  including the 1837 <i>Grande messe des morts</i>, the 1840 <i>Symphonie
  funèbre et triomphale</i>, the 1849 <i>Te Deum</i>, and <i>L’Imperiale</i>,
  fulfill Bloom’s (1998) description of Berlioz’s reputation “as a patriotic
  composer with a penchant and talent for the musically grandiose.” To these
  architectural works, I apply the term “national monumentalism,” conceived by
  Therborn to classify grand architecture in European capital cities as symbols
  of political power. By technique of orchestration, ensemble size, or
  performance space, national monumentalist music exalts the state, monarch, or
  citizenry in times of war, mourning, or celebration.</p>
  <p>The modern political paradigm of soft power allows us to examine Berlioz’s
  political works without having to classify his ideology. Scholars describe a
  soft power “umbrella,” under which resides the hierarchy of “public,”
  “cultural,” “arts,” and “orchestral” diplomacies. I suggest that national
  monumentalism functions as a lateral extension of arts diplomacy and thus
  argue that Berlioz’s two “monumental” Latin works, the <i>Grande messe des
  morts</i> and the <i>Te Deum</i>, operated as soft power, engaging both
  foreign and domestic publics. The <i>Grande messe des morts</i> represents a
  volcanic fulfillment of Minister Gasparin’s desire to re-elevate French
  ceremonial music to its previous prestige. The <i>Te Deum</i> engages with a
  foreign public in the opening and closing ceremonies at the French Grand
  Exhibition of 1855, which displayed France’s achievements to global
  dignitaries. We can thus interpret these “monumental” works as an exaltation
  of the French nation to its citizens both at home and abroad, using them as a
  barometer for French culture, changes in attitude, and patriotism.</p>
