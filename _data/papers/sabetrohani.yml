title: "Georg Philipp Telemann as Music Theorist"

abstract: |
  <p>While Georg Philipp Telemann is well-known today as one of the most
  influential and prolific composers of the eighteenth century, it is far less
  known that he was also deeply interested in questions of music theory. In my
  paper, I argue that when his theoretical writings are brought together for
  careful evaluation, Telemann emerges as an important—and certainly one of the
  most neglected—musical thinkers of the eighteenth century.</p>
  <p>Telemann’s published writings on music theory range from the most practical
  matters of music pedagogy, such as thoroughbass rules, to more speculative
  matters such as a description of a newly devised “ocular organ.” Other
  theoretical insights might be hidden enigmatically in his musical works,
  waiting to be deciphered. Finally, Telemann’s lively correspondence with
  fellow musicians frequently touches on questions of music theory and analysis.
  In my paper, I draw together these little-known writings, commentary, and
  correspondence to paint a more coherent picture of Telemann’s thoughts related
  to music theory, revealing their implications for his own works.</p>
  <p>Studying theory treatises from the period makes us realize that music
  theory in eighteenth-century Germany could include various issues that do not
  necessarily fall under more traditional notions of music theory we hold today.
  These include not only matters of interval generation, thoroughbass,
  counterpoint, and the like, but also questions of performance practice,
  organology, and the study of composition. In many ways, Telemann’s eclectic
  writings on music theory reflect the same eclectic and multi-stylistic
  qualities we can observe in his vast compositional works. </p>
