title: A Corpus Study of Pitch Polarity in Praise-Singing and Hip-Hop

abstract: |
    <p><i>Tonal counterpoint </i>is a common device in the oral improvisatory
    tradition of Yorùbá <i>oríkì</i> (praise-singing), first documented by
    Ọlátunji (1984). Both <i>tonal</i> and <i>counterpoint</i> are terms familiar
    to musicians, but the meaning here is the linguistic <i>tonal</i>, not the
    harmonic, and the rhetorical <i>counterpoint</i>, not polyphonic. Ọlátunji
    describes couplets in which each phrase is parallel if not identical in terms
    of phonic content and the first sets up a tonal expectancy for the second. The
    contrast might also be between words within a single phrase. There are three
    primary categories of tonal counterpoint in Yorùbá <i>oríkì</i>: parallelism
    of similar words; homophone change; and non-lexical contrast providing
    paralinguistic affect. Through the application of computational analysis to a
    broad corpus, we provide substantial documentation for a phenomenon that may
    be as ubiquitous in Africana (Black) vocal arts as rhyming is in Indo-European
    cultures. Analysis of an American hip-hop subcorpus suggests diachronic change
    in the use and complexity of pitch polarity over the last three decades. Over
    the decades American hip-hop has evolved away from couplets to include
    patterns involving three or more phrases, or even marked contrasts within a
    single phrase. During the same period, pitch polarity has remained more stable
    in examples of traditional vocal arts from Kenya and Nigeria despite varying
    degrees of exposure to emerging global hip-hop. This presentation incorporates
    concepts from music theory and linguistics with signal processing techniques
    to analyze a newly gathered and annotated corpus of recorded music.</p>
