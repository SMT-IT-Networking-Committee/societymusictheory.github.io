abstract: |
  <p>Currently, music theory does not have a standard apparatus for analyzing
  the complex relationship between notated orchestration, performed sound, and
  listener perception—most general studies of orchestration focus instead on
  developments in compositional, cultural, or technological practice. My paper’s
  goal is therefore to construct a two-stage theory of timbre’s effects: first
  addressing how performers produce timbres from orchestral scoring, and then
  addressing how listeners produce meaning from the performed timbres.</p>
  <p>Adapting ideas from affordance theory, I suggest that humans <i>use
  </i>music just as we use physical objects to perform tasks. Performers act
  both as users (of scores) and designers (of performances), while listeners act
  as users (of the performances). What sort of use each human actor chooses
  depends on the affordances<i> </i>of the object.</p>
  <p>In the theoretical first half of the paper, I build a taxonomy of timbre’s
  affordances for listeners. I illustrate these with an excerpt from Fauré’s
  <i>Requiem</i>, contrasting the orchestration in the Rutter and Nectoux
  editions. In the analytical second half, I compare three different recordings
  of a passage from Schubert’s “Great C Major” Symphony to demonstrate: first,
  how performers use the same scoring to generate radically different sound
  structures; second, how each of these performances affords different
  metaphorical conceptualizations of the resultant sound structures. </p>
  <p>I conclude by suggesting that we should reorient the study of orchestration
  away from merely examining the arrangement of notes on the page, to
  considering how human agents (performers and listeners) interact with these
  notes to produce sounds and meanings. </p>
