abstract: |
    <p>Although most songwriting teams in the Great American Songbook wrote
    music first and lyrics second, most studies of music-text interaction in this
    repertoire still evince a lyrics-first mindset, in which the music is viewed
    as “text-setting.” In this paper, I propose the opposite approach: considering
    lyrics as a form of “music-setting,” in which the lyricist’s superimposition
    of a verbal form (the rhyme scheme) upon the composer’s pre-existing musical
    form counts as an act of analysis.</p>

    <p>I examine songs written in the years 1924–1943 by teams who worked in a
    music-first fashion. From these, I generate a list of the standard 8-bar
    phrase forms that the lyricists “set.” These are classified as “open” or
    “closed,” depending on whether the phrase is constructed from motivically
    parallel halves. Each possible rhyme scheme is likewise open (e.g. abbc)
    or closed (e.g. abab).</p>

    <p>My analyses focus on cases in which there is a contrast between open
    lyrics and closed music (or vice versa), and cases in which lyricists set
    the same musical phrase to multiple rhyme schemes across a song. I suggest
    that in the latter, widening or narrowing the space between rhymes
    contributes a sense of verbal “looseness” or “tightness,” affecting a
    sense of rhyme-rhythmic motion.</p>

    <p>My conclusion affirms that lyricists’ rhyme schemes are more than just
    static arrangements of similar-sounding words. We cannot understand the
    forms of these songs without them, because they dynamically impart the
    essential formal properties of closure and motion at or above the musical
    level.</p>
