abstract: |
    <p>Most studies of expressive timing in classical music analyze
    performances in conjunction with scores. But many listeners do not access
    scores. They work from sound alone to ascertain rhythm and rubato
    simultaneously. Conflict arises between with-score and without-score
    perspectives whenever rubato is extreme enough that a listener perceives a
    different rhythm from what is notated. In this paper, I examine instances
    of this conflict in the verismo opera tradition and the challenges they
    pose for theories of rhythm perception.</p>
    <p>I first propose five ontological levels at which rhythm manifests:
    ideal (prototypical norms), notated (what is written), performed (what is
    notated plus the performer’s rubato), sounding (durations without rhythmic
    interpretation), and perceived (what is understood by a listener). I then
    provide multi-level analyses of passages from <i>Cavalleria rusticana</i>,
    <i>Pagliacci</i>, and <i>Tosca</i>. I suggest that in each case, the
    perceived rhythm is different from the notated rhythm at even the level of
    meter and/or hypermeter. I then ask: what might it feel like to be the
    performer here, what might it feel like to be the scoreless listener, and
    why might this performing tradition have been established in the first
    place?</p>
    <p>I conclude by exploring the implications of these examples for rhythm
    theory as a whole. The hard distinction between rhythm and rubato is
    undermined when tempo manipulation is aurally indistinguishable from
    metric manipulation. Instead of defining “expressive timing” as deviation
    from written note values, I suggest that timing is made expressive by the
    ascription of agency.</p>
