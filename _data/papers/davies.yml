abstract: |
  <p>Despite recent inroads into the historical and social study of colonial
  music from New Spain, certain basic issues of performance practice remain
  unclear, including considerations such as pitch, voice types, and the
  composition of continuo ensembles. These questions fall into two broad
  categories: the first is the tradition of contemporary ensembles to perform
  <i>mestizaje</i> by freely mixing folkloric elements and instruments into
  cathedral repertoire, sometimes resulting in exoticism; the second,
  overshadowed by the first, derives from more prosaic issues of notation and
  organology. One significant problem is the notational use of high clefs in the
  villancico, not only in the seventeenth century but, archaically, several
  decades into the eighteenth century as well. In fact, slightly more than half
  of the surviving villancicos at Mexico City Cathedral by Manuel de Sumaya
  (1680–1755) (eighteen out of thirty-four pieces) use high clefs, as do nearly
  half of those (twenty-three out of fifty-two pieces) by his predecessor
  Antonio de Salazar (ca. 1650–1715). The practice disappears with the arrival
  of Italian musicians trained in the galant style.</p>
  <p>This paper intends to weigh evidence concerning both of these strands of
  performance issues, building upon institutional documentary records,
  iconography, and musical repertoire to attempt to find a reasonable range of
  performance practice guidelines for New Spanish cathedral villancicos in the
  decades before and after 1700. It will reevaluate the composition of continuo
  ensembles, advocating an increased use of harps and <i>bajones</i> for groups
  today and suggest that many of the villancicos in high clefs need downward
  transposition of a fifth (especially works with a natural key signature and
  untexted, active bass lines). In so doing, it suggests that period sonorities
  were considerably different from what we tend hear on modern recordings,
  namely lower in pitch, with a more bassoon-dominated sound, and with choirs of
  mixed-age men. Gaining a better understanding of such mechanics will hopefully
  encourage more historically informed experimentation with the repertoire, at
  least as a contemporary option.</p>
