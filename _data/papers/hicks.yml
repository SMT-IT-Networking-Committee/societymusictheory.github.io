      bio: |
        <p>Andrew Hicks’ research focuses on the intellectual history of early musical thought from a cross-disciplinary perspective that embraces philosophical, cosmological, scientific and grammatical discourse in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and spans the linguistic and cultural spheres of Latin, Greek, Persian, and Arabic. His first book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/composing-the-world-9780190658205?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Composing the World: Harmony in the Medieval Platonic Cosmos</em></a> (Oxford University Press, 2017), won the Society for Music Theory's Emerging Scholar book award (2018) and the ASCAP Foundation Deems Taylor/Virgil Thomson book award (2018). He collaborated with Fr. Édouard Jeauneau on John Scottus Eriugena’s <em>Commentary and Homily on the Gospel of John </em>(CCCM 166, Brepols 2008), and he is currently preparing the first edition of William of Conches’ <em>Glosulae super Priscianum </em>(Brepols) and a new translation of Boethius’ <em>De arithmetica</em>. His published essays range across the history of music theory, late ancient and medieval Pythagoreanism, medieval Platonic commentaries, the reception of Martianus Capella, textual criticism, and musical metaphors and modalities in Classical Persian literatures. He won the 2018 Berlin Prize from the American Academy in Berlin for research on his next book titled <em>The Broken Harp: Listening Otherwise in Classical Persian Literature</em>. </p>

    <p>Pythagoras resides at the heart of music theory’s origin myths, from the ubiquity of the sonorous blacksmith’s forge to the purported Pythagoreanism of the <em>Timaeus,</em> which embeds a “state of the art” harmonic system in the soul of its cosmogony. But Pythagoras did not work alone. According to a long tradition of Greek “Orientalism,” Pythagoras conferred with Babylonians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persian magoi, and even—according to a tradition ascribed to “Aristoxenus the musician” (Hippolytus, <em>Elench.</em> 1.2.12–13)—met Zarathustra himself. This paper focuses on the Persianate traditions of Pythagoreanism, reciprocally mapping the imaginary travels and historical translations of Pythagoras, both the translation of Persian wisdom traditions into Greek Pythagoreanism and the retranslation of Pythagoras from Greek sources into medieval Arabo-Persian music theory. Both are puzzling. The Greek appropriation of Zarathustra reorients the legitimization of Platonic philosophizing (Vasunia 2007; Horky 2009); and the re-reorientations of Pythagoras in medieval Arabo-Persian sources reinscribe a motif central to the history of Western philosophy (Guttas 1998; Izdebska 2014). Hence, to locate the origins of music theory with Pythagoras is to locate the global encounter at the very beginnings of music theory. But is this “original global” itself a product of the Western imagination, the conflation (à la Walter Burkert and M. L. West) of “orient” and “origin”? Considering this question reveals the fantasy of Greek philosophy’s “other” (Hartog 2006) and the productive assimilation of this fantasy by its “other,” thereby putting the postcolonial condition at the heart of a global music theory.</p>
