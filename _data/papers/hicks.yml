    <p>Pythagoras resides at the heart of music theory’s origin myths, from the ubiquity of the sonorous blacksmith’s forge to the purported Pythagoreanism of the <em>Timaeus,</em> which embeds a “state of the art” harmonic system in the soul of its cosmogony. But Pythagoras did not work alone. According to a long tradition of Greek “Orientalism,” Pythagoras conferred with Babylonians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persian magoi, and even—according to a tradition ascribed to “Aristoxenus the musician” (Hippolytus, <em>Elench.</em> 1.2.12–13)—met Zarathustra himself. This paper focuses on the Persianate traditions of Pythagoreanism, reciprocally mapping the imaginary travels and historical translations of Pythagoras, both the translation of Persian wisdom traditions into Greek Pythagoreanism and the retranslation of Pythagoras from Greek sources into medieval Arabo-Persian music theory. Both are puzzling. The Greek appropriation of Zarathustra reorients the legitimization of Platonic philosophizing (Vasunia 2007; Horky 2009); and the re-reorientations of Pythagoras in medieval Arabo-Persian sources reinscribe a motif central to the history of Western philosophy (Guttas 1998; Izdebska 2014). Hence, to locate the origins of music theory with Pythagoras is to locate the global encounter at the very beginnings of music theory. But is this “original global” itself a product of the Western imagination, the conflation (à la Walter Burkert and M. L. West) of “orient” and “origin”? Considering this question reveals the fantasy of Greek philosophy’s “other” (Hartog 2006) and the productive assimilation of this fantasy by its “other,” thereby putting the postcolonial condition at the heart of a global music theory.</p>
