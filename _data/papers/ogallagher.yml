abstract: |
    <p>In this paper I shall argue, firstly, that there is strong evidence to
    suggest—contrary to lingering popular belief—that the late-period
    improvisations of the saxophonist John Coltrane are in fact highly
    structured; and secondly, that this structure is often achieved via a
    conceptual organizing principle in which melodic unity and clarity are
    manifest through the use of trichordal pitch collections.  The
    presentation will focus on the track ‘Iris’ from the recording <i>Stellar
    Regions</i> (recorded 1967; posthumous release 1995) and ‘Saturn’ from the
    recording <i>Interstellar Space</i> (recorded 1967; posthumous release
    1974) as exemplars of this improvisational approach.</p>

    <p>Musical set theory will be employed as the main methodology through
    which to present evidence of such trichord pitch-class sets in Coltrane’s
    late work. Three small-scale case studies from ‘Iris’ and ‘Saturn’ will
    illustrate Coltrane’s use of set classes (013), (024) and (025) in support
    of my argument. <i>En route</i>, the potential influence of Nicolas
    Slonimsky’s Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (1947) will be
    examined, showing not only Coltrane’s almost literal duplication of
    specific exercises during these improvisations, but also the larger
    implications of the segmentation of these exercises into trichordal
    subsets.</p>

    <p>While the three examples to be discussed each have unique features,
    together they reveal Coltrane’s larger conceptual design, in which
    interval content is a unifying force and where trichordal pitch
    collections realize this interval content, both with clarity and melodic
    precision.</p>
