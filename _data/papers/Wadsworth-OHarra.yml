    <p>Brent Yorgason’s (2020) model of <em>Urlinie Play</em> extends the Schenkerian analytical project to trace rivalries between structural lines that are not limited to the soprano, a situation typical of 19<sup>th</sup>-century music. Yorgason distinguishes between focal and non-focal (“shadow”) Urlinien, defining categories of Urlinie Play that vary in their degree of structural dependence between rival lines. This elegant typology, however, is not a useful heuristic for questions of musical narrative. To connect Urlinie Play with musical narrative, we examine whether aspects of the Urlinie Play model align with recent theories of musical narrative, particularly Hatten (2004) and Almén (2008). Only Yorgason’s strategy of Competition (a rivalry between two nearly equal lines) suggests the mapping of registral rivalries onto other expressive rivalries, for instance between major and minor modes. We next redefine Urlinie Play as a competition between registers that unfolds throughout a work. In this temporal process, a series of registral objects, each corresponding to a focal line, creates a narrative that can be traced on different levels of abstraction. At the most general level, we propose a new, four-fold set of narrative archetypes that vary mode (major or minor) and direction of focal register (up or down). After tracing these narratives in Chopin’s Preludes, we have found that the archetypes predict stable semantic meanings across different works. In conclusion, reorienting Yorgason’s model around registral competition results in cogent narrative analyses that will interest scholars and performers alike.</p>
