abstract: |
  <p>Viktor Zuckerkandl (1896–1965) is best known for the two-volume <i>Sound
  and Symbol </i>(1956/71)<i>, </i>in which he seeks a philosophy <i>through
  </i>music. His assertions about musical experience—e.g., that meter is best
  described in terms of waves and that time itself is perceivable through
  music—have proven particularly compelling, and they appear in several recent
  studies on rhythm and meter. Yet a central aspect of Zuckerkandl’s output has
  been little discussed: his dissemination of Heinrich Schenker’s ideas. A
  highly regarded student of Schenker, Zuckerkandl emigrated to the United
  States around the time of the Austrian <i>Anschluß</i>. But while many of
  Schenker’s better-known émigré disciples taught aspiring professional
  musicians, Zuckerkandl taught generalists in the humanities and delivered
  lectures to experts in other fields. This paper examines his adaptation of
  specialized scholarship for a broad audience.</p>
  <p>Drawing on unpublished archival materials alongside published sources, I
  first discuss Zuckerkandl’s music analyses for the non-specialist; the first
  movements of Beethoven’s opp. 57 and 26 will be our main focus. Zuckerkandl’s
  analyses are largely consistent with Schenker’s, but they emphasize the
  metaphysical foundations of the theory while downplaying its mechanics.
  Further, as I show in the latter part of the paper, Zuckerkandl promotes
  Schenker’s theory as a tool for perceiving organic structure and for
  distinguishing “genius” from lesser talent. I explore how Zuckerkandl’s
  approach runs counter to the familiar narrative of Schenker’s
  “Americanization.” Indeed, his writings force us to grapple with dogmatic
  aspects of Schenker’s theory that have been traditionally sidelined in the
  American academy.</p>
