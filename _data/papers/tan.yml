    <p>Progressive rock is characterized by scholars and music critics as a
    genre that emphasizes the mind over the body, such that it is “not about
    music for dancing” (Macan 1997), but rather designed for careful
    listening. When groove-based sections do occur, they often feature complex
    rhythms or meters that “[lessen] the music’s bodily appeal, calling for
    thought about rhythm rather than immediate participation in it” (Stone
    2016). Other scholars, however, have argued that prog fans do engage with
    this music bodily, suggesting that the phenomenon of groove in prog
    deserves further exploration.</p>
    <p>While previous scholarship on metrically complex grooves has discussed
    their structural features or their signification of artistic seriousness,
    I focus on how musical elements model the process by which listeners might
    learn how to entrain to these grooves. Prog songs frequently feature
    teleological processes in which “difficult” grooves are repeated until
    they become contextually stable in a sequence that may span multiple
    formal units. Similarly, textural modifications likewise counterbalance
    rhythmic and metric complexity, creating a narrative arc that rewards the
    learning of complex temporal patterns. Through several analytical
    vignettes, I demonstrate how the “groove-learning process” enacted in
    these songs interacts with text and formal structure. Thus, these grooves
    provide insight into how “music for listening” may be rendered
    danceable.</p>
