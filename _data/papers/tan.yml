    <p>This paper examines two lectures delivered by theorist-philosopher Viktor Zuckerkandl (1896–1965) at the Eranos conferences. Established in 1933 under the influence of Carl Jung, Eranos has long been a site of esoteric thinking: scholars of religion and mythology, natural scientists, psychologists, philosophers, and members of the general public gather annually to discuss themes related to mysticism, the occult, and the irrational. I focus on Zuckerkandl’s adaptation of specialist music-theoretical approaches for this multidisciplinary audience.</p>
    <p>In “Die Tongestalt” (1960), Zuckerkandl seeks an understanding of music-as-<em>Gestaltung</em> (creation, design), illustrating how time unfolds at multiple hierarchical levels in Bach’s <em>Well-Tempered Clavier.</em> Drawing on unpublished correspondence between Zuckerkandl and Eranos founder Olga Fröbe-Kapetyn, I show that Zuckerkandl viewed the <em>Tongestalt</em> as the source of human self-awareness (<em>Selbsterkenntnis</em>) and Heinrich Schenker’s theory as the key to unlocking it. The presence of Schenker is surprising given Zuckerkandl’s audience. It also points to an alternative reception of Schenker’s ideas that has received scant attention, one in which problematic aspects are sanitized through a wash of metaphysics.</p>
    <p>In the second lecture, “The Truth of the Dream and the Dream of Truth” (1963), Zuckerkandl suggests that musicians have ready access to a “third space” that resides between physical and mental worlds. Demonstrating with analyses of the <em>WTC</em> again, and with reference to Jung, Zuckerkandl attempts to bring his audience into this realm. I show how this is motivated by Zuckerkandl’s overarching belief in a generally accessible “musical thinking” that exists in a separate realm from “mere logical thinking.”</p>
