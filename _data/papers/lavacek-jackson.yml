abstract: |
    <p>As chromaticism expanded in the long nineteenth century, composers
    sometimes relied upon the expedient of enharmonic spelling at the cost of
    indicating true chord function.  In this foundational study of the rare case
    of <sup>b</sup>IV, we focus on those examples where the voice leading suggests
    that we accept such striking chromaticism at the composer’s word.  From our
    analyses of <sup>b</sup>IV usage, we have derived three voice leading
    paradigms and will present examples ranging from local surface progressions to
    the deepest layer of harmonic organization.  They are:
    1) I-<sup> b</sup>IV-V-I, 2) I-IV-<sup> b</sup>IV-I<sup>6</sup>, and 3)
    <sup>b</sup>IV as the upper third of <sup>b</sup>II.  Chopin was a pioneer
    of all of these usages, often conjuring up <sup>b</sup>IV in relationship
    with the more common lowerings, <sup>b</sup>II and <sup>b</sup>VI, an
    interdependent family of expressive inflections.</p>

    <p>The larger conclusion we draw is that some chromaticism cannot be
    reduced to a diatonic background, but is indeed structurally chromatic.
    This view of irreducible chromaticism resonates with, rather than
    represses, the expanded expressive spectrum achieved in the Romantic
    period.  It is offered as an amendment to Schenker’s claim, still
    reaffirmed by prominent followers, that only diatonic tones can be found
    at the deepest structural level.  We contend that the permeation of
    chromaticism like <sup>b</sup>IV deep into tonal grammar was integral to
    the naturally expanding life of the tone and not merely colorful surface
    adornment.</p>
