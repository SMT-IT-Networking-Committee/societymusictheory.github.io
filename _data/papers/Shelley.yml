    <p>As music departments work to expand course offerings to include a more representative range of genres and styles, the task of immersing students in unfamiliar repertoires grows all the more urgent. While reading, writing, and listening assignments are common fare in many music classrooms, model composition is an underutilized and valuable tool for helping students to grasp the fundaments of an increasingly diverse set of musical traditions. In this presentation, I discuss model composition’s contributions to the historical, theoretical, and analytical skills students develop in my courses on black gospel music. This approach has proved fruitful for undergraduate and graduate students, in-person and on zoom, and for students with a range of backgrounds who entered the course with vastly different forms of musical preparation. After outlining my approach to these assignments and describing both the students’ semester-long creative processes and final products, I will reflect on a few of the lessons I learned in the gospel classroom.</p>
