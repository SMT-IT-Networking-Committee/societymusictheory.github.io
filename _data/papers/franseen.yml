title: "Between ‘Excessive Counterpoint’ and ‘Emotional Mysticism’: Form and Musical Meaning for Vernon Lee and Rosa Newmarch"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In a letter from 1875, Violet Paget (who later adopted the pseudonym
  “Vernon Lee”) feared the potential psychological effects of studying musical
  aesthetics and theory. In outlining a book on Italian Baroque opera, Lee
  dismissively claimed, “most of the people who have written on music had either
  lost all suppleness of mind from excessive study of counterpoint, or, worse,
  had rendered themselves limp, faded, and quasi-hysterical from indulging too
  much in emotional mysticism.” Throughout their musical histories, biographies,
  and hermeneutical work, both Lee and her contemporary Rosa Newmarch spoke of
  balancing what they saw as the facts of analysis with the emotional excess of
  (auto)biographical readings of instrumental music. In this presentation, I
  reread Lee’s music perception studies and Newmarch’s program notes as a kind
  of proto-feminist and queer musical analysis. By considering this body of work
  as a form of music theory and musicology, I ultimately argue for an expansion
  of musicology’s scope to include theorists and musicologists as agents in the
  history of music and a re-examination of music researchers active outside of
  the academy in the early twentieth century.</p>
