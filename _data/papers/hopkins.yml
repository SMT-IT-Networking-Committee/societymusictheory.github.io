abstract: |
  <p>In the European and American postwar tumult of (re)building, expanding, and
  exploring, sound was used to study and depict the natural environment. By the
  onset of the space age, scientists were “listening” out into space and down
  into the oceanic abyss, while musical conventions in the increasingly popular
  genre of nature documentary helped convey the dramatic pursuit of Science to
  the public. Yet the imbalances manifested between humans and their environment
  as a result of what is often referred to as the Great Acceleration of the
  Anthropocene were paralleled by the ongoing entanglement of facts and values
  expressed in these documentaries and their reception. </p>
  <p>This paper examines the relationships between sonic worlds—natural,
  (Western) social, real, and imagined—by way of two oceanographic
  documentaries: Jacques Cousteau and Louis Malle’s 1956 <i>Le Monde du
  silence</i> (The Silent World), with music by Yves Baudrier, and Jean Painlevé
  and Geneviève Hamon’s 1965 film, <i>Les amours de la pieuvre</i> (The Love
  Life of the Octopus) with a <i>musique concrète</i> score by Pierre Henry.
  Baudrier’s deep-sea musical depictions serve as part interspecies voice-over,
  part underwater ballet, romanticizing the work of Cousteau’s swashbuckling
  scientists even as they lay waste to reefs and ocean creatures. By comparison,
  Henry’s recorded sound manipulations express a seemingly elastic relationship
  to reality—a suitable aesthetic for an inscrutable cephalopod. While Cousteau
  was praised for authentic representation, Painlevé and Hamon were criticized
  by the scientific community for their surrealistic, otherworldly film.</p>
  <p>Highlighting the bricolage of historical and geographical spaces implied by
  sound and music in these documentaries, I question their implied
  scientific-political discrepancy between facts and values, conservation and
  fetishization. As Susan Lepselter has argued, exploration potentially arouses
  an uncanny feeling—a sort of blurring between the possible and the impossible.
  Following Donna Haraway, I ask whether sound—that “uneasy ocean of air”—might
  provide a way of understanding the “(s)cenes” in which we find ourselves:
  Cousteau’s “Capitalocene,” the single-player (Western) story of world
  relations against Painlevé’s “Chthulucene,” a way of understanding our
  historical epoch through “multispecies stories and practices of
  becoming-with.”</p>
