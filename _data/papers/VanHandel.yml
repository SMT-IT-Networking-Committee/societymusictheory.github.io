    <p>This presentation considers what it means to be a graduate student in music theory in the 21st century. Discussion of curricular reform at the undergraduate level is well underway, but there has been much less discussion of the graduate-level curriculum and requirements. The discipline is evolving and changing, so how have graduate programs adapted, and how can a graduate program best prepare students for academic or non-academic positions?</p>
