abstract: |
  <p>During the height of the so-called “sitar explosion” of 1966–67, one
  reviewer declared breathlessly that sitarist Ravi Shankar dazzled audiences
  with “demonic virtuosity that virtually toppled the senses.” Such statements of
  admiration are remarkable when we consider that barely a decade earlier,
  violinist Yehudi Menuhin warned viewers of the first performance of Hindustani
  music on American television that they had to temper their expectations and
  “not expect unbridled passion or flame as in Spanish or Hungarian Music.” Both
  scholarly and first-hand accounts have generally attributed this shift in
  reception to Shankar’s association with the Beatles. Such a narrative accounts
  for the change in scope, but it bypasses the complexities of cross-cultural
  reception and fails to explain how music that was once widely described as
  strange could become a suitable vehicle for the display of remarkable skill.

  <p>In this paper, I argue that those things taken as musically given at the
  height of Shankar’s popularity were constructed through performance, discourse,
  and media in the preceding decade. An analysis of broadcast and recorded media
  as well as newspapers, letters, and advertisements from the pre-Beatles
  reception of Hindustani music in the U.S demonstrates how even Shankar’s lauded
  musical skill was not an obvious fact for early audiences. Instead, Shankar and
  his many collaborators—especially Yehudi Menuhin—worked to establish Shankar as
  a musician whose skill was intelligible to Americans despite their lack of
  background knowledge. This unfamiliar music displayed human virtue that could
  map onto identities valued by American audiences: those of the productive
  laborer and the cosmopolitan subject. Shankar was in some ways an example of
  this cosmopolitan subjectivity, though he was also portrayed as a curator of
  his own exotic culture—bringing the “best of India” to his Western listeners.
  Contrary to the assumption that Shankar’s virtuosity was a pre-existing quality
  waiting to be “discovered,” treating virtuosity as a socially constructed
  phenomenon reframes the issue. Rather than an objective measure or purely
  subjective opinion, virtuosity arises as the result of intersubjective
  experience and value. </p>
