    <p>Thoughtful musicological discussions are common among Phish fans despite a general lack of formal musical training. Discussions typically involve the band's live improvisations, which fans divide into two types: “Type 1” and “Type 2.” These categories were first introduced in a 1997 online forum by fan John Flynn, who described Type 1 as “jamming that is based around a fixed chord progression,” and Type 2 as “jamming that improvises chord progressions, rhythms, and the whole structure of the music.” For over two decades, fans have widely accepted and freely referred to these categories when discussing live versions of the band's songs, but this terminology is far too simplistic to accurately describe Phish's wide range of improvisational strategies.</p>
    <p>Since Type 1 jams are essentially standard rock solo episodes, this paper focuses on Type 2 jams, which are divided into several sub-categories. While a Type 1 jam may simply circle around a basic two-chord progression (common examples are I – ęVII or I – IV), a Type 2 jam might use the same progression but deviate from it in the following ways:</p>
    <p>1) Consensual Dissonant Jamming (CDJ). Here, individual performers may stray from a song's harmonic progressions, typically leading other members to deviate as well.</p>
    <p>2) Resistant Dissonant Jamming (RDJ). In this sub-type, an individual band member resists the basic progression, playing dissonant melodies or chords against their fellow musicians who adhere to the progression.</p>
    <p>3) Mayhem Jamming (MHJ). In this rarest of sub-types, all players deviate from the progression using individual dissonant musical ideas.</p>
    <p>Replacing the two basic jam-types with these three broad categories not only accurately describes the complexity of rock improvisation, it also reveals that jamming styles are at least in part determined by each member's reaction to dissonance as a way to venture into new harmonic spaces. Audio examples from across Phish's career demonstrate each type. By examining the improvisations of a single rock band, we can create a framework in which to hear other band's jam styles, serving as a springboard for further studies of other improvisational rock music.</p>
