    <p>There is an iconic passage near the end of Balanchine’s <em>Concerto Barocco</em> (1941), set to J. S. Bach’s Concerto in D Minor for Two Violins (BWV 1043), in which ten female dancers hop on pointe, first in unison and then in two groups, creating an exciting pattern of visual accents syncopated against the music. This is the climax of a “plotless” ballet that is, nonetheless, about music and movement. To date, the relationship between dance and music in Balanchine’s choreography has been studied primarily through the phenomenological lens used in dance studies, wherein dance is understood to be the communication of feeling through symbolic forms. However, in Balanchine’s plotless ballet, dance communicates musical ideas rather than feelings.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I analyze Balanchine’s choreography as patterns of rhythms and shapes. Using annotated videos and choreomusical notation, I show how the choreography features motivic development and funky rhythms, reflecting both Bach’s compositional strategy of <em>inventio</em> and 1920s–30s jazz musicians’ practice of “swingin’ the classics.” Starting with a close look at the climax, where a cross-modal echo intensifies the audiovisual effect, I widen the lens to trace choreographic and musical elements of that climax in inter-movement motivic connections. In <em>Barocco,</em> Balanchine interacts with Bach’s score and jazz-music practice not through drama or narrative but through patterns of time and space. This paper contributes to research in music embodiment and multimedia perception, offering a case study that moves beyond binary determinations of cross-modal congruence or incongruence to analyses of interactions in documented patterns.</p>
