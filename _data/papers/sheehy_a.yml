abstract: |
  <p>In 2017, the Twitter hashtag #thanksfortyping pointedly exposed the degree
  to which women have long served as stenographers, transcribers, and
  proofreaders for their academic partners. Several citations also highlighted
  women’s work well beyond mechanics: vetting ideas, carrying out research, and
  executing domestic labor (both physical and emotional). In other cases, women
  have worked to protect and preserve their partners’ legacies as widows. This
  talk aims to open up a discussion about these forms of labor in the history of
  music theory via two case studies, Therese Marx (1820–after 1869) and Jeanette
  Schenker (1874–1945).</p>
  <p>Marx and Schenker’s “behind-the-scenes” work not only made possible but
  also, I propose, shaped the theoretical achievements credited to their
  partners, i.e., the inauguration of the <i>Formenlehre</i> tradition and
  development of “Schenkerian” contrapuntal theory. As comments from their
  husbands attest, the Marx and Schenker partnerships were also bound up with
  broader issues in political and intellectual history. Thus, the consideration
  of women’s labor becomes more than a “recovery” project; it illuminates both
  the imbrication of music theory with everyday life and the broader cultural
  stakes embedded in musical thought.</p>
