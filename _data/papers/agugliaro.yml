abstract: |
  <p>In 1873, the Philadelphia police arrested dozens of Italian men and women
  responsible for smuggling children into the country to be employed as street
  musicians. Though they often came from a specific area in southern Italy,
  those children did not play the traditional music of their region. Rather,
  they were taught a generic “Italian” musical repertoire, resonating with the
  idea of Italy cultivated by their foreign clientele. In that repertoire, a
  prominent role was reserved to Italian opera, a genre that had become
  increasingly popular among the American upper classes during the nineteenth
  century, and which found in Philadelphia one of its major centers in the US
  The prestige of Italian opera grew also in the following decades, to the
  advantage of the local Italian community. In 1901, while a massive wave of
  unskilled workers was immigrating from Italy, a group of Italian leaders in
  Philadelphia raised funds to erect a bust of composer Giuseppe Verdi, thus
  reminding Americans “of the glories of a country [Italy] which is excelled by
  none in the eminence, and talents, and virtues of its sons.”</p>
  <p>Music scholars and historians (Ceriani, Luconi) have discussed the efforts
  of Italian <i>prominenti</i> to rehabilitate the image of their community
  through opera at the beginning of the twentieth century. In my paper, I focus
  on Philadelphia, home of one of the largest Italian communities in the US, to
  put this process into historical perspective. Drawing on contemporary press,
  archival resources, interviews, and additional scholarly literature (Leydi,
  Zucchi, Hamberlin), I suggest that the idea of opera as a marker of Italian
  identity, already propagated in the nationalist sense during the Italian
  Risorgimento, became a racial stereotype in the American context, which in
  turn would be (re-)appropriated by the local Italian community in response to
  an increasingly hostile social environment. By doing so, I will show that
  opera, while being part of the “sonic color line” (Stoever) that gradually
  emerged to both describe and discriminate against Italian immigrants, was also
  a strategic tool used by that same community to survive, and carve a space for
  itself, in an alien society.</p>
