title: "Heinrich Glarean, Jakob Paix, and the Problem of Polyphonic Mode"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Theorizing mode in polyphony was a major concern for 16th-century
    theorists. These same questions have attracted significant attention from
    musicologists, especially following Harold Powers (1981, 1982, 1992).
    Gregory Barnett argues, “The modes are poor analytical tools, but they are
    rich in cultural significance. Each variant theory reflects a slightly
    different Renaissance-era world-view that is translated into musical
    terms” (Barnett 2013, 183). Jakob Paix puts forth a unique variant of
    modal theory. In 1589 the German organist Paix applied the 12-mode system
    from Heinrich Glarean’s <i>Dodecachordon</i> (1547) to a practical
    keyboard print, the <i>Thesaurus motetarum</i>. This keyboard intabulation
    of vocal works, purportedly in chronological order, gives each piece a
    single modal designation, often alongside direct quotation of Glarean’s
    modal descriptions. Paix’s modal labeling stands at some distance from
    Glarean’s and gives insight not only into Paix’s conception of mode but
    also hints toward a larger humanistic project that extends beyond the
    relatively modest claims that the print explicitly makes. I argue that
    this print positions Paix as not only an editor and composer but also as a
    learned theorist. Following Sarah Fuller (1996) and Cristle Collins Judd
    (2000) on Glarean’s ideological underpinnings, I argue that Paix tries to
    co-opt Glarean’s humanism, learning, and cultural capital and use it as
    his own. Though Paix’s display of erudition has more style than substance
    at points, his modal labels display a unique approach to the problem of
    mode in polyphony, one that is often flexible and intuitive yet sometimes
    convoluted and questionable.</p>
