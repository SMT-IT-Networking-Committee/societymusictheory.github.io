abstract: |
  <p>English music theory around the turn of the seventeenth century is often
  noted for its practical and intellectually insular nature (Herissone 2000,
  Christensen 2004). In contrast to this insularity, Charles Butler’s <i>The
  Principles of Musik</i> (1636) shows a writer deeply engaged with Continental
  music theory, theology, and contemporary politics. A country vicar probably
  best known for his work on beekeeping, <i>The Feminine Monarchie</i> (1609,
  1623, 1634), his <i>Principles of Musik</i> is anything but practical and
  intellectually insular. Butler’s practical explanation of the elements of
  music has received some attention (Bailey 1998, Owens 1998). But in Butler the
  practical musician exists alongside deeply speculative and theoretical
  discussions of the art, usually relegated to Butler’s lengthy and careful
  notes which at times greatly exceed the body of the chapter. The theoretical
  portions of Butler’s work have received substantially less scholarly study. My
  paper aims to reposition Butler’s treatise as a work of great erudition (both
  in music and theology) and a work of clear practical value. <i>The Principles
  of Musik</i> shows a socially engaged music theory that treats music writ
  large as its object, not simply the fundamentals of the art. What emerges in
  my study is a thoughtful musician and careful expositor of texts both ancient
  and modern, a writer concerned not simply with promoting accurate singing but
  also with providing compelling arguments for the necessity and moral
  uprightness of public music at a time when music’s value was being openly
  challenged.</p>
