abstract: |
    <p>Thus far, scholarship on extreme-metal music has focused almost
    entirely on sociological issues raised by the music’s transgressive ethos,
    lyrics, and subculture. Indeed, the often explicitly violent or Satanic
    images of extreme metal appear to invite this emphasis. But to seem
    powerful and convincing to fans, extreme metal must also communicate
    transgression <i>musically</i>. As Michelle Phillipov has argued, a
    tendency to favour political concerns within popular-music studies risks
    ignoring questions of musical pleasure (Phillipov 2012). To demonstrate an
    analytical approach, I have chosen the extreme-metal voice as a topic that
    has proved difficult for popular-music scholars to discuss in detail.
    Using spectrograms, I will argue that the acoustical properties of vowel
    formants serve a primary expressive role in enhancing the uncanny timbral
    qualities of extreme-metal vocals.</p>

    <p>I begin from a performer’s perspective, addressing the physiological
    mechanisms involved in the production of extreme-metal screams as well as
    their acoustical characteristics. I then detail two separate contexts where
    vocalists have sacrificed the intelligibility of their lyrics by expressively
    altering their vowels: 1) a recorded improvisation from a volunteer vocalist
    and 2) an excerpt from “The Vowel Song” (2008) by the band Zimmers Hole.
    Finally, I present the results of a corpus study on 48 wordless screams that
    shows quantifiable differences in how vocalists in different metal subgenres
    approach vowels. By revealing expressive vocal nuances that have passed
    unnoticed in popular-music scholarship, I hope to show how investigating
    questions about musical sound can provide unique and broadly applicable
    insights into extreme metal’s appeal.</p>
