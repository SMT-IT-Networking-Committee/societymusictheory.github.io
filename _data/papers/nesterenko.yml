abstract: |
  <p>The 1960s turn to spirituality in Europe and the US, sparked by the
  violence and political unrest of the time, is rarely discussed in relation to
  concert music. As Sholl and Maas argue in <i>Contemporary Music and
  Spirituality</i> (2016), isolated studies about individual composers rarely
  provide a larger narrative context. This is true about composers in the USSR,
  as the major biographies of Gubaidulina, Schnittke and Pärt describe their
  interest in religion as singular cases prompted mainly by personal
  circumstances in the country where religion was largely forbidden. This paper
  provides a more nuanced view looking into performance history of three works
  by Gubaidulina, <i>Introitus</i> (1978), <i>Offertorium</i> (1980) and
  <i>Seven Words</i> (1982).</p>
  <p>First, I present historical background of spiritual revival in the USSR.
  Due to repressions of believers during Stalin’s rule, the generation born in
  the 1930’s was raised completely secular. Repressions continued during the
  Khrushchev Thaw (1954–64); the emerging disillusionment about communist ideals
  and a romantic allure of a forbidden practice, however, generated an interest
  in spirituality in literary and artistic circles that emerged in the 1960s and
  flourished in the 1970s and 1980s. Second, I demonstrate that it was possible
  to study religious music in Russia, and that interest in religion was an
  important part of non-conformist composers’ milieu. Vladimir Martynov’s
  research of religious rituals that he undertook since 1978, Yuri Butsko’s
  reputation as a connoisseur of liturgical chant, as well as a great number of
  works with religious references composed in Moscow between 1968 and 1989,
  demonstrate that religion was accessible and in demand among composers. Third,
  I challenge widespread opinion that Gubaidulina’s music was censored mainly
  because of her religiosity. By discussing three works spanning only four
  years, and all completed before Perestroika, I demonstrate the ambiguity of
  Brezhnev Era censorship, when the “fate” of the piece often depended on
  factors other than musical style or the presence of religious references.
  <i>Introitus</i> was premiered in Moscow, <i>Offertorium</i> had to be
  premiered abroad, and the “Christian title” of <i>Seven Words</i> was
  substituted for Partita for cello, bayan, and string orchestra by the censors
  during the Moscow premiere. </p>
