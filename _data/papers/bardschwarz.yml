    <p>In this talk I will discuss Furrer’s piece for solo piano from three
    perspectives: 1) a musical representation of a poem by Sylvia Plath, 2) what
    the piece does with a single half step (B-natural/C-natural), and 3) how its
    approach to the Lacanian Real has cultural significance for early 21st-century
    subjectivity.</p>

    <p>The poem: Furrer’s piece is a song without words for piano based on the
    “Munich Mannequins” by Sylvia Plath.</p>

    <p>The Music: This piano work is written in such a way that after one
    system is played, the bass staff becomes the treble staff of the next
    system; that system then has a new bass staff. The new bass staff of the
    second system then becomes the treble staff of the next, etc.</p>

    <p>The analyses will focus on what happens with pitch-classes B-natural
    and C-natural in relation to the images of voice and voicelessness that
    pervade Plath’s poem. I will conclude the musical-analytical portion of
    the talk by showing how Furrer obliterates the subordinate relationship
    inherent in the half step for centuries of common practice music making.
    In Furrer, the two pitch-classes are coordinated with one another, and
    subordination is (as it were) cracked open to reveal the Lacanian
    Real.</p>
