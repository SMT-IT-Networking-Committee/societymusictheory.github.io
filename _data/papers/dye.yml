abstract: |
  <p>For most of the 1930s, White Top Folk Festival, the popular Virginia music
  festival, was a battleground in a war between two factions of Virginia
  folklorists. White Top organizers Annabel Morris Buchanan and John
  Powell—whose festival work, radio broadcasts, and lectures on racial and
  cultural purity had earned them success and acclaim—clashed with the Virginia
  Folklore Society (VFS), the academic organization that had collected the
  poetry of Child ballads in Virginia’s mountains since 1913. VFS members
  worried that “the Whitetoppers” were usurping their position as the authority
  on Virginia’s folklore, in part because of Powell and Buchanan’s attention to
  music. They knew that to truly hold the definitive collection of Virginia’s
  folklore, they had to expand beyond words to melodies. For this, they needed
  women. Women musicians and schoolteachers—able to transcribe tunes from
  Appalachian singers by hand—provided a free source of skilled labor, and
  gathered most of the society’s collection.</p>
  <p>Using original research into letters between Virginia Folklore Society
  members, I argue that women’s musical skills and labor comprised a crucial
  part of early-twentieth-century academic folklore. I look at what folklorist
  Alfreda Peel called “The Battle of White Top” as a window into the
  intersection of women, music, and folklore. Since its inception, the VFS
  worked folklore into women’s cultural spaces by speaking at women’s clubs,
  establishing small folklore clubs at state teacher’s colleges, and encouraging
  schoolteachers to collect ballads, thus fostering an eager and ready
  workforce. I then position this case study within the larger history of the
  professionalization of women in music, and of music as “women’s work.”</p>
  <p>This paper pushes against received claims that most folklorists were men,
  and histories of folklore that ignore women or single out lone actors as
  exceptions to a rule. By uncovering women’s labor lying below the surface of
  institutional folklore projects, it positions women’s musical skills as key
  assets in the folksong collection effort. The battle over Virginia’s folk
  music connects women’s musical work and the folklore project, adding a new
  facet to the growing history of American women’s musical life.</p>
