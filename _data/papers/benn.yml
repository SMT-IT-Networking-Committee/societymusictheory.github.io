abstract: |
  <p>In 1887, Friedrich Albert Zorn published his <i>Grammatik der
  Tanzkunst</i>, a textbook for dancers, dance teachers, and choreographers.
  Zorn’s work has long been of value to dance reconstructors because of his
  notational system, which allows for a rare, unmediated glimpse into
  nineteenth-century choreographic conventions. However, the <i>Grammatik</i> is
  a work that holds other riches as well. Zorn does not apply himself
  exclusively to theatrical or social dance. Instead, he attempts to access the
  universal principles underlying both disciplines. He is deeply invested in the
  development of dance as a serious art form. As the title of the work suggests,
  literacy is a major concern for Zorn, and he believes that dance may progress
  to a stage of advanced theoretical rigor only through the widespread adoption
  of a notational system. A major component of the dance theory that Zorn
  proposes centers around the metrical structuring of time, and accordingly, he
  dedicates a chapter of his textbook to music. Zorn’s chapter represents a rare
  attempt to theorize the relationship between music and dance, and enables us
  to explore nineteenth-century understandings of this crucial link.</p>
  <p>Studying dance from a sonic standpoint highlights the deeply embodied forms
  that listening can take. Dancers listen to music in a different way than
  static observers, and what they value about it is particular to their needs.
  These forms of kinesthetic listening leave traces in the choreography, and
  thus embodied listening practices become preserved in the danced text. Zorn’s
  chapter forces us to examine the notion of choreographic listening. What are
  dancers and choreographers in late-nineteenth-century Europe listening to?
  This question leads to a deeper, philosophical engagement with the nature of
  dance music itself. In this paper, I propose a genre-based understanding of
  dance music, borrowing principles derived from, among various sources, genre
  theory in film studies. In investigating the intimate relationship between
  music and dance, Zorn’s <i>Grammatik</i> invites us to think of
  nineteenth-century dance as a sonic artifact.</p>
