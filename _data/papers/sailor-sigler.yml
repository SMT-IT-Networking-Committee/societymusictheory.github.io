title: 'Renaissance “Dissonance Fingerprints”: A Corpus Study of Dissonance Treatment from Dufay to Victoria'
handout: 'siailor-sigler.pdf'
abstract: |
    <p>Using new software that sorts dissonant note-pairs into dissonant
    idioms (e.g., suspension, cambiata), we present the results of a corpus study
    of over 2,100 movements of Renaissance counterpoint, from Dufay (1397–1474) to
    Victoria (1548–1611). As a major nexus of stylistic evolution in Renaissance
    music, dissonance treatment has long been studied, but computer-assisted
    analysis enables us to: (1) re-examine it on a more comprehensive scale, (2)
    describe, search for, and count new dissonant idioms, and (3) calculate
    individual composers’ “dissonance fingerprint,” which may prove useful in
    questions of attribution.</p>

    <p>Dissonant idiom definitions in Palestrina’s style, as described by
    theorists such as Jeppesen and Schubert, successfully categorize virtually
    all High Renaissance dissonance but cannot account for a significant
    minority of dissonances in earlier music (e.g., Ockeghem). Defining new
    idioms to account for these earlier dissonances, we show that the
    trajectory of Renaissance dissonance treatment was a consolidation where
    general tendencies of dissonance treatment (e.g., downwards resolution)
    became uniform, and the most common dissonant idioms (passing tones, etc.)
    became very nearly the only acceptable idioms.</p>

    <p>The rigor required for computer analysis leads us to identify a new
    family of dissonant idioms: a pair of voices simultaneously attack a dissonant
    interval, but one of these voices sounds a pitch-class either still sounding
    in another voice or left at the moment of onset. Since explaining such
    dissonances requires invoking notes from outside the dissonant pair, such
    idioms indicate an emerging necessity for something like a chordal model to
    explain dissonance treatment.</p>
