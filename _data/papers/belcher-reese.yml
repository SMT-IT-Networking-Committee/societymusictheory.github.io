abstract: |
  <p>Perhaps the most influential adaptation of Riemann’s ideas is the subfield
  of Neo-Riemannian theory summarized by Cohn (2012). However, this subfield,
  which relies on the twelve-tone <i>Tonnetz</i> and constituent P, L, and R
  transformations, faces two major limitations: the forced assumption of
  enharmonic equivalence and the exclusion of dissonant harmonies. In an attempt
  to redress these limitations, we adapt two Riemannian tools, the
  <i>Klangnetz</i>, and the <i>Doppelklang</i>, and demonstrate their analytical
  utility through explorations of works by Bach, Bauer, Mussorgsky, Schubert,
  Strauss, and Szymanowski.</p>
  <p>The <i>Klangnetz</i> is a dualist geographical model of <i>Klang
  </i>relations based on Klumpenhouwer’s (2002) “Riemannian map.” We
  conceptualize the model’s topography as a staircase of alternating risers and
  treads relating adjacent <i>Klänge</i> by perfect fifth
  (<i>Quintschritt</i>/<i>Gegenquintschritt</i>), R (<i>Terzwechsel</i>), and P
  (<i>Quintwechsel</i>). The <i>Doppelklang</i>, adopted from Riemann’s<i>
  Skizze einer neuen Methode der Harmonielehre</i> (1880), explains dissonant
  sonorities as a combination of two consonant <i>Klänge</i>. Each<i> Klang</i>
  within may manifest in its entirety or may manifest incompletely, and the
  entire sonority can be modeled on the <i>Klangnetz</i>. We also apply the
  <i>Doppelklang</i> concept to post-tonal sonorities, following Gollin (2011),
  and extend the theory to include combinations of more than two
  <i>Klänge</i>—<i>Dreifachklänge</i>, for example. </p>
