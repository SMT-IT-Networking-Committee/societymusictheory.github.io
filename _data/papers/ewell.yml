    <p>For over twenty years music theory has tried to diversify with respect
    to race, yet the field today remains remarkably white. SMT’s most recent
    report on demographics shows that 90.4 percent of full-time employees in
    music theory are white, while 93.9 percent of associate/full professors
    are. Aside from this literal whiteness, there exists a figurative and even
    more deep-seated whiteness in music theory. This is the whiteness—which
    manifests itself in the composers we choose to represent our field inside
    and outside of the classroom, and in the theorists that we elevate to the
    top of our discipline—that one must practice, regardless of one’s own
    personal racial identity, in order to call oneself a music theorist. Thus,
    for example, I am a black person, but I am also a practitioner of “white
    music theory.” In this presentation, a critical-race examination of
    the field of music theory, I try to come to terms with music theory’s
    whiteness, both literal and figurative. By drawing on the writings of
    sociologists Joe Feagin and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, among others, I
    posit that there exists a “white racial frame” (Feagin) in music
    theory that is structural and institutionalized. Further, I highlight
    certain racialized structures which “exist because they benefit
    members of the dominant white race” (Bonilla-Silva).  Ultimately, I
    argue that only through a deframing and reframing of this white racial
    frame will we begin to see positive racial changes in music
    theory.</p>
