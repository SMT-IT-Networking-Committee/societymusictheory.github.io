title: "Music Theory for the “Weaker Sex”: Oliveria Prescott’s Columns in The Girl’s Own Paper"

abstract: |
  <p>Music theory offers a rich array of disciplinary contributions that
  intersect in compelling ways with the growing body of scholarship in the
  public humanities, especially if we consider other kinds of texts beyond our
  existing canon of published treatises. This paper examines a cluster of
  music theory articles by Oliveria Prescott (1843–1919), which were published
  between 1886 and 1891 in <i>The Girl’s Own Paper </i>(<i>TGOP</i>), a
  popular British periodical for young women. Although little known today,
  Prescott sustained a vibrant musical career in London as a composer and
  teacher, and her articles on music theory regularly appeared in major
  periodicals such as the <i>Musical World</i> and <i>TGOP</i>. </p>
  <p>Prescott’s work for <i>TGOP</i> presents a rare opportunity to explore
  music theory that was not just written by a woman, but intended for a genteel
  female audience. Prescott’s articles include explanations of fundamental
  theoretical concepts (cadences, basic harmonic progressions) as well as short
  analyses of solo piano works by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. These articles are
  noteworthy for their discussions of formal design (phrase structure, sonata
  form) and chromatic harmony (augmented-sixth and diminished-seventh chords),
  concepts that might seem surprising for a popular periodical for young ladies.
  Mainstream journalism is often devalued as a “less serious” form of
  intellectual discourse, but Prescott’s work complicates stereotypes of
  ignorant amateur female musicians and the so-called “private” sphere, and it
  demonstrates how print journalism could serve as a vital public platform for
  the circulation of music theory among young British women in the Victorian
  era. </p>
