abstract: |
    <p>This paper examines depictions of lesbian desire in <em>Fun Home</em> (2015). Based on Alison Bechdel’s eponymous graphic memoir, the musical chronicles Bechdel’s emerging awareness of her lesbian identity and contrasts her eventual acceptance of her own sexuality with that of her closeted gay father, who commits suicide. I draw on Halberstam’s (2005) conception of “queer temporality” to show how the musical departs from conventional formal structures in its overall design and in two songs that directly address Alison’s lesbian identity: “Ring of Keys” and “Changing My Major.”</p>
