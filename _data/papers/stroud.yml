title: Insidious Irony in the “Tarantella” from John Corigliano’s Symphony No. 1
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>The finale to Corigliano’s <i>Gazebo Dances</i>, a boisterous
    tarantella, at first seems an unlikely choice for a symphonic theme in a
    movement that depicts the tragic loss of a friend to AIDS. The tarantella
    quotation in the second movement of Corigliano’s Symphony No. 1, with its
    bouncy leaps, rambunctious dance rhythms, and its tonal emphasis on C
    major, contrasts sharply with the somber and expressive mood established
    in the first movement of the symphony. Ultimately, the tarantella theme is
    torn apart—destroyed by musical disruptions that gradually distort and
    remove original features of the theme. In an ironic narrative archetype,
    features can retrospectively take on the role of incipient, or emergent,
    transgressions, especially if they act in a way to tear apart the order
    established at the beginning of the work. I explore how multiple layers of
    irony enact an ironic narrative in the “Tarantella” movement, which, in
    turn, points to tragic cultural ironies in society’s response to AIDS.</p>

    <p>In this ironic landscape, the pastoral becomes the grotesque, a dance
    spins out of control, and the solid foundation of a diatonic pitch center
    crumbles in the face of atonal uncertainty. The ironic narrative archetype
    is one layer to be uncovered in a story that draws together ironies at
    different interpretive levels, from the structural archetype to the work’s
    biographical and cultural context.</p>
