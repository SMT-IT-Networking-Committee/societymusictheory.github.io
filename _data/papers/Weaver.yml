      bio: |
        <p>Charles Weaver is on the faculty of the Juilliard School, where he teaches historical plucked instruments, Baroque music theory, and improvisation. He has also served as adjunct faculty at the CUNY Graduate Center and at St. Joseph’s Seminary and College. He also works with the New York Continuo Collective, an ensemble that mounts workshop productions of seventeenth-century vocal music with an emphasis on the performance practice of rhetorical declamation and improvised accompaniment. Of his conducting of Cavalli’s <em>La Calisto</em> for New York’s Dell’Arte Opera, <em>The Observer</em> remarked, "It was amazing to hear what warm and varied sounds he coaxed from the ensemble." He has also served as assistant conductor for Juilliard Opera and has participated in opera productions at the University of Maryland, the Cleveland Institute of Music, Princeton University, Yale University, and the Boston Early Music Festival. As an orchestral musician, he has performed with the Orchestra of St. Lukes, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra, and the Virginia Symphony. In addition to being a regular member of the ensemble Quicksilver, his chamber-music projects have included engagements with Piffaro, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Folger Consort, Apollo's Fire, Blue Heron, the Newberry Consort, and Musica Pacifica. He is the organist and director of music at St. Mary's Church in Norwalk, Connecticut, where he sings and conducts renaissance polyphony and plainchant. He is pursuing a doctoral degree in music theory at the City University of New York, with a research focus on the rhythmic interpretation of plainchant at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>Olivier Messiaen's early compositions often feature his second mode of limited transposition—the octatonic scale—a collection whose symmetrical properties have long fascinated theorists. Analyses of these second-mode pieces, including analyses by Messiaen himself, are often content to identify which octatonic collection contain a particular series of chords. In this poster presentation, I show that this music can be analyzed more effectively with the algebraic tools of neo-Riemannian theory, in a manner inspired by Leah Frederick's recent research into diatonic voice-leading spaces.</p>
    <p>In particular, I define an octatonic-step transformation, in which multiple voices move by successive parallel steps within an octatonic scale. Messiaen calls such progressions "parallel successions of chords," and they are a common surface feature of his music. Using a model that employs a mod-8 voice-leading space, I show that this transformation operates at more abstract levels as well, though its presence is often hidden by oblique or contrary contrapuntal motion on the surface. This model provides a fuller explanation of Messiaen's characteristic octatonicism than previous analyses.</p>
