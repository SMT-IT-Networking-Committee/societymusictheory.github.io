abstract: |
  <p>Although musicologists typically consider the reigns of Edward VI (1547–53)
  and Mary I (1553–58) as distinct Protestant and Catholic periods, historians
  including Eamon Duffy and Susan Brigden have shown that society remained
  heterodox into Elizabeth I’s reign. The populace’s differing beliefs posed a
  challenge for the crown, as subsequent rulers developed new methods through
  which to enforce shifting religious orthodoxies. Building on work by John
  Alpin (1979) and John Caldwell (1978), this paper examines the changing
  functions and musical forms of the <i>Te Deum</i> during the reigns of Henry
  VIII, Edward VI, and Mary I, demonstrating that the hymn played a strategic
  role in the religious agendas of their respective governments. Drawing on
  contemporary diaries, church accounts, and manuscript sources of polyphony,
  this paper argues that like other European monarchs, Henry VIII deployed the
  <i>Te Deum</i> in celebratory public rituals designed to engender support from
  his subjects. Henry’s continued use of the hymn following his break with Rome,
  moreover, suggests he valued its associations with the ceremonial past despite
  the hymn’s obvious “popish” connections. Under Edward VI, it was the hymn’s
  ancient Ambrosian and Augustinian provenance that resonated with reformers,
  who desired a return to the earlier church. The appearance of English-texted,
  polyphonic versions of the <i>Te Deum</i>, alongside the hymn’s place at
  Morning Prayer in the new Edwardine liturgy, reveals an intentional reshaping
  of this Catholic chant from a public, quasi-secular symbol of royal power into
  a liturgical emblem of reformed belief. Like her half brother, Mary I
  similarly turned to the <i>Te Deum</i>, instead to celebrate her embrace of
  Catholicism; like her father, she employed the Latin <i>Te Deum</i> in public
  processions, hoping to facilitate the re-conversion of a “Protestant” public
  to Catholic orthodoxy. In the latter two cases, Edward and Mary both relied on
  collective memory of the hymn’s sound and the residue of earlier performances
  to imbue present contexts with symbolic meaning, despite their contradictory
  religious agendas. The <i>Te Deum’s</i> performance history in
  mid-sixteenth-century England thus highlights the role music played in the
  crown’s attempts to impose religious orthodoxy on a heterodox public.</p>
