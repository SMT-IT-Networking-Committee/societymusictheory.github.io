abstract: |
    <p>Among recent music copyright cases, few have received as much public attention or provoked as much debate as <em>Williams v. Gaye</em>. The case, which centered on an infringement claim by Marvin Gaye's estate against Robin Thicke's controversial hit “Blurred Lines,” concluded in 2018 with the Gayes prevailing. Yet debate is sure to continue for a long time to come: the case ended in a split decision, and recent court filing by the Gaye family claiming that Williams perjured himself all but guarantees that the conversation around “Blurred Lines” is far from over. </p>
    <p>Several <em>amicus curiae</em> briefs were filed in connection with the case. Among them, two offered opinions, on opposing sides, of expert “musicologists” concerning the expert testimony that was presented. Both were joined by some of our profession's most visible and distinguished music theorists, musicologists, and ethnomusicologists, and articulate sharply different positions with respect to the testimony provided by the Gayes’ musicological expert witnesses, Judith Finell and Ingrid Monson. The Thicke <em>amici</em> contended that this testimony was misleading on the one hand, and irrelevant on the other (Thicke Amici, 1-3). The Gaye <em>amici</em> argued that the testimony was “fully consistent with the accepted Musicological standards and methods” (Gaye Amici, 1) and attacked the Thicke amici's analysis as little more than “an interminable catalogue of nits, ornamentations and other insignificant variations” (25). Intriguingly, the <em>amici</em> seemed to fall along familiar disciplinary lines: in general (and with notable exceptions), the Thicke <em>amici</em> had a markedly higher representation of music theorists, the Gaye <em>amici</em> a markedly higher representation of musicologists or ethnomusicologists. </p>
    <p>This paper revisits this dispute among experts without the adversarial frame in which it was initially cast, and inquires whether and to what extent ideas about similarity in music-and, more broadly, about the proper scope and application of copyright-reflect disciplinary orientation. Insofar as this is so, the umbrella term “musicologist,” which courts have tended to use without regard for disciplinary specialization, brings to these public proceedings a misleading connotation of objective neutrality. </p>
