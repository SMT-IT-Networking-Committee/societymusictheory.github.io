    <p>Marin Mersenne, author of the <i>Harmonie universelle</i> (1636-37),
    has long been recognized for his obsession with mathematical permutation,
    combination, and calculation. His passion for combinatorics seems to
    account for one of his most infamous passages, in which he systematically
    writes out all 720 permutations of the Guidonian hexachord—twice.
    Historians of mathematics and science, and more recently of music theory,
    have tended to situate these exercises within narratives about the early
    history of combinatorics and explorations of its applications, to which
    Mersenne was an important contributor. Yet his decision, on certain
    occasions, exhaustively to notate each permutation leaves unanswered the
    question of why he chose to do so when simple arithmetic calculation might
    have sufficed.</p>

    <p>This paper argues that Mersenne’s hexachord permutations, and other
    exercises like it, are part of a deliberate rhetorical strategy of
    abundant display—a strategy that draws on the rhetorical principle of
    <i>copia</i>, most famously theorized by Erasmus in his popular <i>De
    Copia</i> (1512). Although <i>copia </i>has received thoughtful attention
    in musicological studies centering on variation in seventeenth- and
    eighteenth-century composition, its role as an animating principle of
    musico-rhetorical theorization remains unexplored. In Mersenne’s case, the
    display of hexachord permutation invites comparison to, and is clarified
    by, analogous ‘accumulative’ tactics found in his other writings.
    Furthermore, <i>copia </i>may have broader historiographical relevance,
    for it offers a means by which rhetoric can be understood to have a
    meaningful ‘life’ long after its supposed music-theoretical ‘death’ at the
    turn of the nineteenth century.</p>
