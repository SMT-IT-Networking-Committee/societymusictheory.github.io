  <p>When Robert Burton pondered the physical and philosophical aspects of
  melancholy in <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i> (1621), he could not have
  imagined that this temperament would emerge as a pervasive national
  melancholia that would afflict British monarchists throughout the eleven-year
  Interregnum following the execution of Charles I in 1649.  Drinking became a
  political emblem of Royalism as well as solace during this era of melancholy,
  with taverns and clubs the environment where improvised poetry and music
  blended with whiskey and tobacco to create a subversive opposition culture to
  the reigning Republic.  When the monarchy was restored with Charles II as King
  in 1660, the unshackled print culture memorialized this vast repertory of
  underground drinking songs through published broadsides and anthologies.  One
  particular anthology provided a musical riposte the nationâ€™s former malaise:
  <i>An Antidote against Melancholy</i> (1661), which ostensibly was a
  collection of drinking songs, but in fact was the core repertory of the
  Royalists, an intoxicating distillation of resistance.  Even though it was
  issued to commemorate the 1661 coronation procession of Charles II, it still
  bore the mask of Interregnum intrigue, replete with covert symbolism. Even
  its editor (John Playford) slyly winked at the repression of the Interregnum
  by publishing it under a pseudonym.  The musical component has been elusive,
  yet once this <i>Antidote</i> is musically interpreted within the extensive
  culture of political drinking songs, its remedy of songs about politics and
  liquor distinctly expresses the relief of the Restoration while still
  ruminating on the persistent melancholy of 1650s Britain.</p>
