    <p>In 1953, Amelia Rosselli (1930–96)—a composer and, later, a famous
    poet—developed a prototype musical instrument with the Farfisa company in
    Ancona, Italy. This electrically-powered reed organ spanned six octaves, with
    sixty-four keys tuned to overtones above a fundamental of 40 Hz. Using this
    instrument, Rosselli created a compositional and improvisational system.
    Inspired both by post-war expansions of dodecaphonic theory and contemporary
    anthropological research into non-Western tuning systems, Rosselli believed
    her methods combined European art practices with acoustic principles found in
    global traditions and human vocal production.</p>
    <p>In the 1950s, Rosselli published two articles and circulated her ideas in
    correspondence with figures, including Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio,
    and David Tudor. In 1962, she completed a month’s residency at the Studio di
    Fonologia (SdF) in Milan, and was in discussions with Italian broadcaster
    Radiotelevisione Italiana to develop new equipment—but the project’s funding
    failed to materialize. Despite trying for years to publish updates to her
    research, Rosselli only succeeded in doing so in a literary journal in
    1987.</p>
    <p>Through her publications and correspondence, I read Rosselli’s engagement
    with post-war music institutions (and particularly the SdF) through Sara
    Ahmed’s concept of <i>paths</i>, or the formation of institutional routines
    through everyday practices, and in light of the exclusion of some bodies on
    the basis of their inability—or refusal—to conform to those routines.
    Rosselli’s story is a case study for how post-war European electronic music
    studios accumulated masculine bodies and practices, demonstrating how women
    with the same qualifications and experience held by their male colleagues
    could not necessarily follow the same paths.</p>
