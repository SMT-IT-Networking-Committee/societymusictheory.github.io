abstract: |
  <p>This paper explores the links between the tonal style of the early
  <i>seicento</i> and the Guidonian pitch aggregates of cantus mollis and cantus
  durus. The aim is, first, to offer an approach that mitigates the complexities
  and anachronisms of recent “modal-hexachordal” analyses (Chafe 1992), and
  second, to throw the distinctively fluid idiom of this period into relief with
  respect to both major/minor tonality of the eighteenth century and the
  precepts of modal theory.</p>
  <p>The connection between the Guidonian pedagogy of pitch relations and
  early-<i>seicento</i> tonal style is investigated in three compositions:
  Peri’s “Se tu parti da me” (1609); Frescobaldi’s Recercar sopra mi, re, fa,
  mi (1615); and Rovetta’s “Memento Domine” (1639). The collections in which
  these pieces are found use just a few combinations of final and mollis or
  durus signature (external tonal features), but within each piece the tonal
  style shows flexibility with respect to where cadences occur relative to the
  final and what kinds of cadences are used (internal features).</p>
  <p>In these pieces, the combination of final and signature lays out a field of
  flatward- or sharpward-ranging possibilities that are handled differently by
  each composer: while Rovetta works consistently among sharpward-ranging points
  of tonal focus suggested by a G-final and durus-signature, Frescobaldi (A,
  mollis) plays on the possibilities for tonal ambiguity, and Peri (A, durus)
  contradicts our expectations of tonal motion for text-expressive purposes.
  Further examples of a Handel aria and a Bach fugue show the consequences of a
  post-Guidonian, transposition-heavy tonal practice: while the
  early-seventeenth-century repertory demonstrates little external variety but
  remarkable internal flexibility, the later practice—with its variety of keys
  but stereotyped functional-harmonic relations—reverses this. A final pair of
  examples, Andrea Gabrieli’s Toccata del Decimo Tuono (before 1585) and
  Murschhauser’s Praeambulum Decimi Toni (1707), exhibits the same change in
  tonal style in spite of their common designation of Mode 10.</p>
  <p>The findings here reveal not only the underlying relationship between the
  seventeenth- and eighteenth-century practices as tonal, but also how
  contemporary theorists interpreted the evolving tonal style of their time
  according to traditional modal precepts.</p>
