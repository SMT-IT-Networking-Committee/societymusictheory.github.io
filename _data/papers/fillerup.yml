  <p>If Mallarmé’s poems are notorious ciphers, Ravel’s settings of them are
  appropriately cryptic—particularly the third song of his <i>Trois poèmes de
  Stéphane Mallarmé</i>,<i> </i>“Surgi de la croupe et du bond.” Ravel never
  explained his interest in this hermetic poem, and recent scholarship on its
  musical setting has been similarly taciturn, focusing on tonal structures (or
  lack thereof) while avoiding Mallarmé’s admittedly baffling text. But given
  Ravel’s professed desire to “transpose” Mallarmé’s poetic processes into
  music, it seems essential to examine musical and textual relationships in
  “Surgi de la croupe” more closely, especially when they pertain to illusory
  experiences. Mallarmé was wary of Wagner’s totalizing illusions: music’s
  acoustical and temporal prolongation might suppress the spectator’s ability to
  bracket aesthetic experience from reality.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I focus on timbre, texture, and musical-textual
  relationships in “Soupir” (the first song) and “Surgi de la croupe” to show
  how Ravel was keenly attuned to Mallarmé’s concerns. “Soupir” uses string
  harmonics to mark the boundaries of poetic (and illusory) experience, but
  these effects serve a very different function in “Surgi.” In Mallarmé’s poem,
  the apparent emptiness and immobility of a decorative vase belies its plastic
  capacity to express meaning. Ravel captures this ambiguity through shifting
  textural planes and raspy string harmonics that suggest the noise of
  unrealized creation. Instead of gazing upon the vase, we are drawn inside of
  it, as if hearing “Soupir” before it has become sound or structure—a kind of
  unheard harmony, or an illusory premonition of “Surgi.”</p>
