abstract: |
  <p>London, 1972. Charlotte Moorman walks onto a concert hall stage—nude but
  for three strategically placed bandages on her knees and left breast—and plays
  a cello made out of ice cubes until the instrument melts to nothing. According
  to composer/collaborator Jim McWilliams, <i>Ice Music</i> is a piece about
  time; it is also a piece about the female body in art and life, and about the
  literal and metaphorical dangers of the avant-garde.</p>
  <p>Minneapolis, 2001. Joan Jeanrenaud (in consultation with McWilliams)
  reimagines <i>Ice Music</i> to include a sleeveless wetsuit and amplified
  metal plates that catch the sound of the dripping water and feed it back to
  the audience. <i>Ice Cello</i> is a piece about transformation, Jeanreneaud
  maintains.</p>
  <p>Chicago, 2017. Seth Parker Woods (with the blessing of McWilliams and
  Jeanrenaud) teams up with sound artist Spencer Topel to reconstitute <i>Ice
  Music/Ice Cello</i> as a full-body wetsuit, an obsidian ice instrument with
  embedded microphones and speakers, and a free approach to movement and form.
  <i>Iced Bodies</i>, Parker Woods says in multiple interviews, is a piece about
  mental illness in African American communities and rampant police brutality in
  Chicago.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that <i>Ice(d) Music/Cello/Bodies</i> has become a
  musico-political palimpsest, a measure of the way the 1960s avant-garde is
  constantly recovered and reinterpreted to speak to contemporary issues of
  gender and race. Drawing on video documentation, critical reception, and
  interviews, I conduct a close reading of <i>Ice Music</i> in its three
  variations, in the process tracing the evolution of the ideal relationship
  between experimentalism and politics in the 1960s and ’70s, that ideal
  relationship as it stands in the present, and the negotiations and compromises
  that have been made to accommodate the difference. Not only does my work
  expand on existing studies of the canonization of the avant-garde, it also
  explores whether and how the presentation of “historical” avant-garde art
  offers audiences models for confronting contemporary politics and the world we
  live in today.</p>
