    <p>This paper analyzes the interplay of motivic shape and context in Guinean Malinke dance drumming, arguing that it is not only the melo-rhythmic shape of motives, but also their relationships to contextualizing temporal cycles, that give them meaning. Temporal organization in this genre is governed by a combination of temporal cycles that interact as the music unfolds, allowing encultured performers, dancers, and listeners to actively engage with the sounds through entrained prediction. As I will demonstrate, metrical complexity in this genre is heightened in two specific ways: by the inclusion of an asymmetrical timeline as one of the temporal cycles, and by the co-importance of both the quarter and dotted quarter cycles in compound time. This non-nesting of metrical cycles ensures that motives on the musical surface may be heard in multiple contexts simultaneously.</p>
    <p>The music under study is a corpus of traditional pieces of the Malinke of Guinea, as disseminated by master drummers Mamady Keita and Fara Tolno. The pieces utilize nine parts, played by a combination of hand drums, stick drums, and bells. To analyze Guinean Malinke drum motives in terms of their temporal placement, I apply a methodology I call <em>momentum vectors.</em> Pairs of musical attacks are analyzed as moving TO, FROM, or remaining NEUTRAL, relative to points on the different metrical cycles contextualizing the music. The non-nesting of metrical cycles ensures that there are often multiple directions for the same pair of notes, imparting depth and complexity to this music.</p>
