  <p>In recent years our image of Johannes Ockeghem has grown ever more subtle.
  Scholars have brought to light—and moved beyond—a tortured reception history in
  which Ockeghem’s music became “mathematical,” “mystical,” even “irrational.”
  Lawrence Bernstein, Fabrice Fitch, and others have since developed a more
  nuanced view, describing Ockeghem as a deeply rational, canny composer who
  practiced an “aesthetics of concealment,” “cover[ing] his tracks” even when
  sometimes making “subversive” compositional decisions. These terms and the
  analytical practices they support evince a scholarly coming of age born of deep
  engagement with Ockeghem’s compositions: no longer mere followers of Besseler
  and Bukofzer, we are now free to paint a complex, multifaceted picture.</p>
  <p>For all of this, our picture could benefit from further refinement. A modern
  tendency to valorize the transgressive and the bizarre has arguably made us too
  alert to Ockeghem’s undeniable strangeness. In what ways, we might now also
  ask, is Ockeghem conventional? Questions of this sort, as Robert Gjerdingen has
  shown in his work on eighteenth-century Neapolitan music, can be tremendously
  useful—for only by understanding the extent to which a composer such as
  Ockeghem inhabited the stylistic conventions of his age can we come to know
  what makes him special. This paper locates in Ockeghem’s music a host of
  generic and stylistic norms, using parameters like texture, mensural practice,
  rhythm, and the handling of cadences—the very parameters often used to
  highlight Ockeghem’s exceptionalism—to throw his “subversive” compositional
  choices into relief. Indeed, I argue that Ockeghem wraps even his most daring
  passages in conventions in order to make them palatable; and that in between
  such passages we find music that, however artful, breathes the lingua franca.
  Redressing the balance of Ockeghem’s reception can help us not only know the
  composer better, but also develop a more sophisticated view of
  fifteenth-century musical style writ large.</p>
