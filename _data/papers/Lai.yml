    <p>This paper explores how temporal sensations of a musical passage change when it is quoted within another context. What varieties of temporal effects occur when quoted material is recontextualized? How does a quotation change when it occurs multiple times in the new work? This paper takes John Adams’s <em>Second Quartet</em> and Henryk Górecki’s <em>Lerchenmusik,</em> both of which quote Beethoven’s music repeatedly, as case studies to investigate these questions.</p>
    <p>To examine the different metrical (dis)continuities represented in musical quotations, I adopt a distinction between metrical and sequential temporality (Roeder 2020), and draw upon different but complementary theories of musical meter (Hasty 1997; Horlacher 1995). Employing Meyer’s (1956) and Huron’s (2006) theories of expectation and realization, I introduce the concept of a “veridical segment”—a grouping of tones that resembles a familiar sequence of events from a specific musical work. By examining how metrical and sequential temporalities change as a veridical segment is reproduced, I characterize the (different) temporal qualities suggested by the quotation and the source.</p>
    <p>For example, Górecki’s quotations of Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto demonstrate a change of temporal function despite the preservation of sequential patterns. In contrast, the sequential discontinuity of the quotations of Beethoven’s op. 110 sonata in Adams’s quartet prompts different temporal interpretations. Moreover, tracing the transforming temporality of the quotations elucidates the overall formal process. In sum, adding to previous approaches that emphasize referentiality and pitch structures, this paper contributes to a broader understanding of musical borrowing by considering rhythm and meter and the in-time sensations afforded by quotation.</p>
