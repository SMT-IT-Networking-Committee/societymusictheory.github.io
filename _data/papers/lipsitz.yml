abstract: |
  <p>Race is a biological fiction but a social fact with deadly consequences.
  Musicking is a social practice through which race as a social construct has
  been learned and legitimated, but also contested and countered. The commercial
  music industry deploys race relentlessly as a marketing strategy, a sign of
  product differentiation, and a source of novelty. The music industry is not an
  innocent entity that sometimes becomes inflected with racism, but rather a key
  institution in the production and dissemination of racial meaning. At the same
  time, members of aggrieved racialized communities employ race as a marker of a
  linked fate and an impetus for democratic and egalitarian social change. From
  the improvisation pedagogy of Students at the Center in New Orleans to the
  round dances of the Idle No More movement in Canada, from the centrality of
  taiko and the fandango to the creation of new Asian American and Latinx
  identities on the west coast, an ethic of grass roots co-creation in music
  counters dominant racist ideas and practices in ways that generate a rich
  inventory of techniques for improvisation and accompaniment.</p>
