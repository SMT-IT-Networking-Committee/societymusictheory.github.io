abstract: |
    <p>In 1918, Max Weber (paraphrasing Schiller) famously proclaimed
    modernity’s “disenchantment of the world.” Weber was speaking specifically
    about the waning of belief in the cold light of science, secularism, and
    rationalized, bureaucratic capitalism, but his dictum has proven remarkably
    resonant beyond the social science quad. Indeed, various species of
    disenchantment arguably pervade the postmodern humanities, as both diagnosis
    and method: the critical theorist disenchants, unmasks, demystifies. Most
    music theorists, it need hardly be said, do something quite different. As the
    SMT celebrates its 40th year, music theory—with its wide-eyed enthusiasms and
    unapologetic close readings, its loving attention to the sonic and the
    aesthetic, its frequent aloofness from the social and political—remains a
    discipline apart, a sort of blissed-out, sylvan glade within the
    left-melancholic academy.</p>

    <p>Depending on one’s intellectual commitments this may be cause for
    celebration or withering critique. But before we exult or condemn, we
    should try, once again, to understand <i>why, </i>as music theorists, many
    of us are so prone to enchantment (despite frequent admonishments from our
    academic neighbors), and what this might mean for our discipline’s future
    and its place in the academic ecology. In this talk I first consider the
    institutional, pedagogical, and material conditions that reinforce music
    theory’s aestheticized practices, specifically in the undergraduate theory
    classroom. I then pivot to research, taking the song “Poor Places” by the
    band Wilco as a case study to stage a fictive encounter between
    (unabashedly enchanted) music analysis and more critically wary
    perspectives from sound studies and Latourian actor-network theory.</p>
