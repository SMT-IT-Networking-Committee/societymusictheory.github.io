abstract: |
    <p>Modulations by tone or semitone are widely recognized as a common
    stylistic element of pop-rock songs but many scholars have casually
    described them with mechanical terms such as “truck-driver modulation” or
    “pump-up modulation.” In place of this view, I frame modulation as an
    element of pop-rock music that is compositionally constructed through
    texture, harmony, and rhythmic energy gain. These modulations occur as part
    of a formal zone that overlaps with other, more traditional, formal sections
    (the <i>modulation zone</i>).</p>

    <p>To begin, I outline historical trends in stepwise modulation based on my
    study of nearly 400 modulating <i>Billboard</i> Top 100 songs spanning
    1950–2010.  I then define the modulation zone and its constituent parts
    based on the seam between one key and the next. Dai Griffiths and Adam Ricci
    have recently published scholarship detailing this seam. Following these
    preliminaries, I outline four specific modulation zone based on
    compositional strategy and demonstrate the utility of these strategies
    beyond mere labelling. By rethinking how pop-rock songs enact their
    modulations, this paper establishes a new perspective that recognizes a
    well-established set of stylistic signs and idioms apart from the obvious
    stark juxtaposition of two keys.</p>
