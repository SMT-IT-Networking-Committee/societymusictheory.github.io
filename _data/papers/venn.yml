abstract: |
    <p>Philip Hensher (2008) has spoken of the way in which his libretto to
    Thomas Adès’s first opera<i>, Powder Her Face</i> (1995), was influenced
    by Wayne Koestenbaum’s 1993 discussion of the operatic silencing of
    women’s voices. The opera’s protagonist, the Duchess of Argyll, is
    accordingly silenced twice—first in a notorious “fellatio” aria, and
    second, figuratively, through her eviction in the final scene from the
    hotel in which she was living. Critical responses to the opera have
    extended this premise to demonstrate how such silencings are mobilized
    within patriarchal and class-based systems (Gallon 2011; Stevens 2017). To
    date, however, much less attention has been given to the Duchess’s
    sounding voice within the framework of these silencing elements, to the
    detriment of a fuller understanding of her as a musical and dramatic
    agent.</p>
    <p>This paper will offer a theoretical model for analyzing Adès’s shifting
    approach to word-setting in response to the varying demands of dramatic
    situation and musical imperatives, illustrated with reference to the
    Duchess’s music in the first and final scenes of <i>Powder Her Face</i>.
    The distinctiveness of the Duchess’s voice through all these shifting
    contexts is such that the hotel maid can mimic her vocal mannerisms,
    prompting the Duchess to exclaim “How you speak to me!,”while
    simultaneously reinforcing how the Duchess speaks to us. Given the
    importance Adès has placed on text-setting (Adès and Service 2012), an
    approach to prosody and word-setting in his music is long overdue.</p>
