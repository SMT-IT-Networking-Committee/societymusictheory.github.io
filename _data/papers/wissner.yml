abstract: |
    <p>Charlotte “Bebe” Wind Barron’s name has become synonymous with mid-century
    electronic film music and she is often referred to as the godmother of
    electronic music. While Bebe’s career is often explored in tandem with that of
    her husband, Louis, her contributions should be examined on their own to best
    understand the crucial role that she played in her collaborations with Louis.
    This paper examines the contributions of Bebe Barron and untangles her role in
    film composition, specifically for<i> </i>her lesser-known films<i>,</i> from
    that of Louis. Bebe’s role in the collaborations with her husband are quite
    distinct, yet in her own interviews she tends to minimize her role with
    respect to Louis’s, often creating a thin line between projecting modesty and
    minimizing her own role in the compositions. However, in considering her
    stated role in film composition, it becomes clear that without the work Bebe
    put in—listening to the thousands of hours of recordings to decide what was
    worth using, which Louis did not want to do—the film scores would have never
    come to fruition. Special attention will be paid here to Bebe’s smaller-scale
    film works, some of which were for industry, teasing out her specific
    contributions to electronic film music practices, especially of the 1950s and
    1960s. A re-analysis and contextualization of Bebe’s interviews about her film
    compositions reveals a new understanding of her role in electronic film
    composition. Through an examination of these interviews, a more accurate
    picture of her role in film composition emerges.</p>
