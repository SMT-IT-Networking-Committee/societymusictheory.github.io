    <p>This paper discusses what will happen to the disciplines of music theory, music history, and ethnomusicology as contingent labor continues to become the norm. It will discuss my experience as someone who teaches many classes at multiple universities. It also considers the implications of contingent labor disproportionately affecting women-identifying scholars and scholars of color and how this will also affect what happens to these disciplines.</p>
