abstract: |
  <p>New settings of Metastasio’s libretti halted abruptly around 1800, a change
  that has been attributed variously to disenchantment with the castrato, to
  frustration with the highly formalized conventions of <i>opera seria</i>, and
  to the rise of the work concept and the status of the composer. Despite these
  factors, the 1820s witnessed a spate of new—though heavily modified—settings
  of Metastasio’s libretti by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Saverio Mercadante, and
  Giovanni Pacini. This paper considers how adapting Metastasio, freshly
  valorized in new printings of his complete works, presented both a solution
  and a problem to both sides of the heated debates between Classicism and
  Romanticism in Italy: though his poetry was no longer compatible with the
  musical language of the new century, Metastasio also signified a glorious
  literary past in a moment of national literary uncertainty.</p> 
  <p>To understand what prompted this revival, this paper draws on
  nineteenth-century writings on Metastasio scattered across theatrical
  journals, compositional treatises, scholarly essays commissioned for new
  editions of his works, and polemical responses to foreign criticism of Italian
  poetry, such as Giovanni Gherardini’s rebuttal to A.W. Schlegel’s <i>Lectures
  on Dramatic Art and Literature</i>. Investigating Metastasio’s reception and
  his complex role as both a classicist and romanticist sheds new—and
  specifically musicological—light on Italian literary debates, many of which
  (such as responses to Madame de Staël’s controversial 1816 article on
  translation) largely ignored opera. Through a comparative study of several
  libretti, I show that early nineteenth-century readers enshrined the emotional
  precision of Metastasio’s poetic style by adhering faithfully to his model in
  recitative passages, while devising new forms and affective registers for the
  lyric expansion of arias and ensembles.</p>
