    <p>Joni Mitchell’s album <em>Blue</em> (1971) is lauded as the zenith of confessional songwriting, with lyrics acting as intimate personal documents and songs as vehicles for self-expression. The album’s titular track illustrates several techniques of lyrical expression in performance. Lloyd Whitesell explores the role of harmony in reflecting the song’s unresolved central relationship, which is “poised between anchored commitment and undone moorings” (2008, 137). But the flexible timing of Mitchell’s studio recording—afforded by her self-accompanied performance practice—is also critical to understanding the song’s expressive impact. My paper explores this central relationship of “Blue” as expressed through Mitchell’s various levels of engagement with metric hierarchy, which vacillate between “anchored” regular meter and moments of lost salience, when hierarchic structures come “undone.” For this analysis, I employ a flexible theory of meter (Murphy 2015, forthcoming) that analyzes metric regularity with grid-based theories (particularly Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983), accounts for reinterpretation with modifications to metric grids (Horlacher 1995), and illustrates loss of meter using projective theory (Hasty 1997). Analyzing flexible meter in “Blue” illustrates the timing freedoms afforded by Mitchell’s solo performance practice and how the varying level of metric salience interacts with themes of freedom in her revelatory lyrics. The close connection between metric structure and semantic content in “Blue” suggests that the metric freedoms afforded by Mitchell’s performance practice are powerful methods of self-expression in her solo confessional songs.</p>
