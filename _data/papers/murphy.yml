    <p>As Neil Lerner has shown, the late film composer James Horner
    appropriated some “wide open” music of Aaron Copland. In particular, he
    finds in Horner’s scores for <i>Apollo 13 </i>and <i>The Perfect Storm</i>
    undisguised instances of a three-harmony wedge progression lifted from
    Copland’s <i>Appalachian Spring</i> that I call the “Copland” schema. In
    three parts, this presentation both scrutinizes Horner’s “Copland” and
    serves as apologia by proxy. First, aficionados and critics repeatedly
    single out Horner as the most notorious of borrowers of preexisting music,
    yet the field of films with the “Copland” in their soundtracks is wider
    than those scored only by Horner. Second, the “Copland’s” field of
    associations in film music has grown beyond both its affiliation with
    religious sentiment in the original ballet, and Lerner’s connection of its
    initial consecutive rising fourths with the vastness of <i>Apollo 13</i>’s
    outer-space frontier. While some cinematic uses of the “Copland” accompany
    wide-open scenes, particularly rugged American wilds, they are also
    conjoined to scenes of determination and self-determination as much as
    they accompany some sense of spaciousness. A thorough analysis of the
    “Copland’s” structure suggests homologies with all three of these
    signifieds. Third, Horner’s multivalent allusions to the “Copland” in his
    score for <i>Field of Dreams</i> reach a level of nuanced sophistication,
    as demonstrated through the employment of a two-dimensional
    “modal-transpositional field.” As the film’s narrative conveys the viewer
    among redesigned aspirational and topographical norms, Horner’s music
    conveys the listener among transformations of a musical emblem for the
    conventionalized American Dream.</p>
