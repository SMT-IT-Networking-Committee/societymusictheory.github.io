    <p>The subtitular “extension” of Dmitri Tymoczko’s (2011) <i>A Geometry of
    Music</i> is nominally of—but ultimately away from—some common tonal
    practices of the 18th and 19th centuries (hereafter, CPs). Endeavors to
    recuperate the book’s first of “four basic claims,” which is that “harmony
    and counterpoint constrain one another” (Claim One), demonstrate this
    divergence. Claim One supposes a polyphonic passage whose lines exhibit
    “conjunct melodic motion” and whose chords exhibit “harmonic consistency.”
    For Tymoczko, pc transpositional or inversional equivalence defines this
    consistency. Claim One purports that these two features require that the
    chords be either nearly even and thus relatively consonant, or clusters.
    However, using parallel motion, any chord can voice-lead with conjunct
    melodic motion to another equivalent chord, which Tymoczko acknowledges
    later in the book.</p>
    <p>One could recuperate Claim One by replacing conjunct melodic motion
    with minimal idealized total voice-leading work, reverting to Richard
    Cohn’s “overdetermination.” However, the pitch-class equivalency that this
    recuperation necessitates also disowns aspects of CPs essential to any
    grammar-like theory for them: top line, bass line, and bass-defined
    harmonic consonance. Or one could recuperate Claim One by recognizing that
    conjunct melodic motion, avoidance of parallel motion, and preferred
    harmony constrain one another because any two of these disallow the third.
    Calling this “underdetermination,” I have recognized this constraint in
    two-voice scenarios favoring imperfect harmony. Generalizing this
    two-voice model, I have fashioned a bounded geometry that can depict
    passages in any number of voices, whereby proximity to the boundary
    represents CP-typicality.</p>
