    <p>Scholarship by Jeff Pressing, Dmitri Tymoczko, Ewan Clark, and myself collectively claims that the seven “Pressing” scale types account for significant portions of the modernist macroharmonic substrate in post-1900 Western art music, film music, and jazz. Unsurprisingly, these Western scholars explicitly or implicitly define Pressing scales using a prevailing Western music-theoretic approach to post-1900 modernist music: atonal set theory. However, the framework that undergirds the 72 <em>mēḷakarta</em> ragas of South Indian Carnatic music provides a fit for modernist scales in much contemporary Western film that is tighter, more elegant, and more suggestive of further research than what Western set theory can offer, in no fewer than five ways. First, they account for cinema’s pervasive use of what Daniel Harrison calls “dronality,” which serves as a vital component in Indian music, but to which the Pressing designation is indifferent. Second, they accommodate just the right blend of dihemitonicism and andihemitonicism that many contemporary soundtracks indulge. Third, they leave out certain modes of Pressing scales that film composers tend to avoid. Fourth, some composers draw explicitly from this specific non-Western source. Fifth, the tonic-dependent combinatorial structure of <em>mēḷakarta</em> classification, unlike the Pressing system’s tonic-independent and set-theoretical classification, neatly suggests a component-wise approach to Western scale semiotics. In this approach, the scale-degree pairs of {♭2,2}, {♭3,3}, {4,♯4}, {♭6,6}, and {♭7,7} each map to an extra-musical contrariety and together constitute a “5-bit semiotic byte” that captures a wide range of associative and expressive nuance. </p>
