American Folk Music"

abstract: |
  <p>The 1952 release of Harry Smith’s <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>
  is often credited with influencing the 1950s and 60s American folk revival.
  This general influence on mid-century songwriting has been established, but we
  can also more specifically position it as a precedent for the kinds of metric
  irregularities found in folk-influenced 1960s singer-songwriter music,
  particularly Bob Dylan’s early songs. The 84 tracks on the three-volume
  <i>Anthology</i> include “old” songs from folk, blues, old-time, country,
  Cajun, and gospel genres that were originally issued as 78s in the 1920s and
  30s. In the 1960s folk scene, versions of songs from the <i>Anthology</i> were
  performed by artists like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Dave van Ronk, who
  referred to the collection as a “bible” for songwriters. In this study I
  investigate how metric irregularities found in the “Ballads” and “Songs”
  volumes of the <i>Anthology</i> display preferences for grouping guitar
  strumming, changes of harmony, and accentual-melodic cues at various levels of
  metric hierarchy. The “weird” meter found in Smith’s <i>Anthology</i> situates
  these early-twentieth-century recordings as precedents for the use of flexible
  meter for text expression in folk-influenced songwriting of the latter half of
  the century.</p>
