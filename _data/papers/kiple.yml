    <p>The “scalar tonality” associated with the music of early twentieth-century Russian and French composers represents one path at a tonal crossroad, located at what Cohn (2012) posits as a third stage of tonal evolution. Analytical methods used to demystify this music focus on context rather than systemic pitch hierarchies, emphasizing harmony’s additive rather than reductive properties. Most scholars demonstrate how collections such as whole-tone, octatonic, and acoustic, etc., supplant the diatonic collection as primary referential objects, but a comprehensive system of parsimonious transformations among referential collections has yet to be excavated. In lieu of such a system, I offer what I call “collection space”—a parsimonious intercardinal voice-leading space for maximally and nearly even sets—as a transformational space representative of Cohn’s third tonal-evolutionary stage.</p>
    <p>This paper is divided into three parts: (1) a rebuttal of criticisms toward graphical spaces of voice-leading relations among intercardinal multisets, (2) the construction of collection space as an exclusive network of parsimonious connections among maximally and nearly even collections of cardinalities four through eight, analogized with Cohn’s pan-triadic and Tristan-genus systems, and (3) a demonstration with animated analyses of music by Fauré, Debussy, and Lili Boulanger, coordinated with live piano demonstrations. I also illustrate how collection space connects systemically to pan-triadic and Tristan-genus systems via what I call “pivotal subsets.” My intention is to elucidate the abundance of possible voice-leading connections and harmonic juxtapositions characteristic of scalar-tonal French music, and to demonstrate how collection space reflects unequivocally this music’s tonal iridescence.</p>
