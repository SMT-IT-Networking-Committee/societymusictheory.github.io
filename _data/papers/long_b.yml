abstract: |
    <p>When Martin Luther King, Jr. described the “fierce urgency of now” at
    1963’s March on Washington, he drew upon a shared cultural memory and
    social consciousness.  In a manner as much musical as rhetorical, Dr. King
    explicated his theme through a series of calls and responses on the riff,
    “now is the time.”  Such forms draw upon a century’s worth of practices
    embedded within the American musical and social fabric.  When poet and
    activist Amiri Baraka cited John Coltrane as the “black blower of the now”
    in his 1979 poem “AM/TRAK,” he asserted the saxophonist’s contemporary
    cultural weight more than a decade after his passing.  In ways similar to
    improvised performance, each example leverages the vitality and relevance
    of a forward-looking emphasis on “the now” against the blurred borders of
    jazz and spoken word.</p>

    <p>Coltrane’s recording of “Alabama” following King’s eulogy for the four
    girls murdered in the Birmingham church bombing marked a seminal
    confluence of journalism, rhetoric, and improvisation. Similarities in
    their spoken cadences and melodic phrase lengths recall activist marriages
    of music and text dating back to the coded meanings of spirituals, yet the
    instrumental nature of the performance and the written word’s initial
    non-musical utility mark a significant departure. Coltrane’s next work,
    the landmark “A Love Supreme,” builds upon this model to offer extended
    phrases and a final movement that syllabically corresponds to his text,
    signaling the increased influence of extramusical source materials upon
    the exploratory freedom of his late career.</p>
