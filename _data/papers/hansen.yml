abstract: |
    <p>While music scholars have long noted that triplets evoke sensations of
    spinning or rotation in listeners (Jankélévitch, 1961; Mellers, 1954),
    this topic has not been subject to theoretical development or empirical
    scrutiny.</p>

    <p>Addressing this question, we first solicited musical examples
    “connoting spinning, rotating, twirling, or swirling” using SMT Discuss.
    Analysis revealed a prominence of fast, repeated, isochronous patterns
    employing stepwise pitch movement and compound meters.</p>

    <p>To explain these associations, we devised an <i>Ecological Theory of
    Rotating Sounds</i> (<i>ETRoS</i>) inspired by ecological acoustics
    (Gibson, 1979). Specifically, listeners acquire sensitivity to continuous
    fluctuations in location, pitch, and dynamics emitted by rotating sound
    sources. Whereas immobile musical instruments producing discrete pitches
    render location and pitch cues largely unavailable, loudness changes
    remain pertinent. <i>ETRoS</i> posits that stress patterns for binary
    (strong-weak) and ternary (e.g., strong-weak-weak) rhythms are consistent
    with a spinning trajectory, unlike archetypal quaternary or quinary
    patterns (e.g. strong-weak-medium-weak, strong-weak-medium-weak-weak). For
    binary rhythms, however, ecologically simpler, pendular representations
    may be cognitively preferred (Chater & Vitányi, 2003).</p>

    <p>Two perceptual experiments tested <i>ETRoS</i>. Participants in
    Experiment 1 rated how much binary, ternary, quaternary, and quinary
    figures evoked sensations of rotation. Experiment 2 used a two-alternative
    forced-choice paradigm pitting ecological quaternary stimuli
    (strong-medium-weak-medium) against unecological ones containing the
    strong-weak-medium-weak pattern more typical of Western music. Our results
    show greater perceived rotation for ecological patterns, for faster tempi,
    and for ternary/quaternary/quinary compared to binary stimuli.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, ecological acoustics provides a plausible explanation
    for the musical qualia of rotation, potentially explaining why composers
    resort to triplet/compound rhythms.</p>
