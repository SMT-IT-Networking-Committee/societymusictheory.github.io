  <p>As Mexico City was the nexus of both temporal and spiritual power in New
  Spain, it is unsurprising that that city’s Metropolitan Cathedral boasted one
  of the largest musical chapels in the Spanish New World. The capital, though,
  did not always hold a monopoly on such music: in the seventeenth century,
  Puebla easily rivaled Mexico City, employing such luminaries as Gaspar
  Fernandes and Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, and Durango, a small yet prosperous
  city in the northwestern scrublands, laid claim to New Spain’s first
  Italian-born <i>maestro de capilla</i> upon the arrival in 1749 of the
  brilliant Roman Santiago Billoni.</p>
  <p>In the mid-eighteenth century at the cathedral in Oaxaca, the Italianate,
  concerted style of baroque music attained a level of sophistication not seen
  elsewhere in New Spain at that time. This came about largely through the
  compositions of four <i>maestros de capilla</i>, namely Manuel de Sumaya, Juan
  Mathías de los Reyes y Mapamundi, Francisco Martínez de la Costa, and, to an
  extent, Tomás Salgado. These four composers’ villancicos, cantadas, and
  concerted Mass settings incorporated not only more modern contrapuntal and
  harmonic practices, but also called for a more operatic vocal technique
  accompanied not only by organ, harp, and dulcian as before, but also by
  orchestras that included flute, oboe, bassoon, and trumpet in addition to
  violin-family instruments.</p>
  <p>This presentation will focus upon the explosion of the baroque style in
  Oaxaca, something touched upon in Mark Brill’s dissertation (1998) covering
  that city’s overall musical style from 1600 to 1800. Using the music of the
  four aforementioned maestros, it will be demonstrated that the concerted
  baroque style flourished more strongly in Oaxaca than in Mexico City.
  Differences between Oaxacan practices and those of other cathedrals will be
  shown, including the continued use of the seventeenth-century
  quasi-Renaissance style at Mexico City Cathedral during Sumaya’s time as
  maestro, the explosion of the galant style at Mexico City under Ignacio
  Jerúsalem, and the appearance of the virtuosic, Corellian style that began in
  mid-century Durango under Billoni. The simultaneous persistence of the
  <i>stile antico</i> across Mexico will also be discussed.</p>
