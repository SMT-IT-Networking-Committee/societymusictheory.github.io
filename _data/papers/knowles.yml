  <p>Music theoretic discussion has been surprisingly mute on the topic of
  silence in music. With a few notable exceptions (Lissa 1964; Pearsall 2006;
  Margulis 2007a, 2007b), most approach silence as either a negation of sound,
  akin to the negative space which demarcates the edges of a sculpture (Barry
  1990), or as a necessary condition of sound—its antithesis (Zuckerkandl 1956).
  Such a view ignores the vast variance in our perceptual experience of silence
  and the numerous ways it is utilized within compositions. While some scholars
  have used descriptive terms for silences, such as framing silences (Pearsall
  2006), “suspense devices” or “expectancy” pauses (Lissa 1964), no unifying
  theory delineating types and functions of silences exists. This work seeks to
  fill that gap, proposing four different categories of silence, each containing
  three subtypes, with the aim of highlighting the variety of silences which
  occur in music and the value of including them in theoretic discourse. The
  proposed categories and subtypes provide a way to identify and discuss
  specific features of silences while using definitions that remain broad enough
  to allow for flexible application. Where possible, the perceptual effects of
  silences within their musical contexts are discussed.</p>
