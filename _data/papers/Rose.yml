    <p>This presentation discusses the role of pronunciation in the recordings of British protest singer Billy Bragg. Sociolinguists in recent decades have taken a keen interest in the idea of the singing accent: the pronunciation patterns that musicians use in their singing and how these may differ from the patterns used in their speech. Peter Trudgill’s (1983) seminal work in this area focuses on American-inspired pronunciation in British pop and rock music from the late 1950s and early 1960s, exploring the motivations, often conflicting ones, that can influence singers’ intentional and unintentional pronunciation tendencies. The approach taken by Trudgill and other sociolinguists is relevant to the musical output of Billy Bragg because pronunciation is a particularly salient feature of this music. Bragg’s singing accent not only puts his working-class origins in Barking, Essex on display, but it does so prominently and unapologetically. Throughout his career, socialism and his own brand of English left-wing patriotism have been the defining features of Bragg’s public persona. Sung pronunciation has been a key tool for Bragg in creating this persona and in communicating its authenticity. In other words, pronunciation has served the purpose of identity creation. Pronunciation has also served to amplify the effects of other musical features, including timbre, melody, and lyrical content. Analysis of several selections from Bragg’s recordings will showcase how identity, authenticity, and musical sound coalesce in these recordings and how pronunciation binds them together.</p>
