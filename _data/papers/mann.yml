abstract: |
    <p>While best known as a student of Arnold Schoenberg, Catalan composer Roberto Gerhard (1896–1970) composed works covering a broad range of styles and genres and was a pioneer of electronic music in England. His position as a student in Schoenberg’s inner circle is reason enough to examine his writings on the twelve-tone method and serialism, but Gerhard also held close associations with the European avant-garde through his active involvement in the International Society for Contemporary Music and developed connections with the American musical community in the 1960s, earning commissions from prominent ensembles and teaching appointments at the University of Michigan and Tanglewood.</p>
    <p>In an examination of his two published string quartets, Symphony no. 2 (Metamorphoses), and <em>Hymnody</em>, I will show how Gerhard serialized temporal elements in a way that clearly differed from his contemporaries. Gerhard used time series to govern both pitch durations as well as the number of beats per bar (offering compositional freedom to use pitches of any duration). Additionally, by dividing a time series into time sets, Gerhard added together each time set’s pcs to generate proportions for governing elements such as tempo markings, phrase lengths and rotations, and large-scale formal sections. While these few examples show some of the numerous ways Gerhard serialized time and space, a closer examination of his compositions, essays, notes, and lectures—particularly those written between 1945–1970—reveals a body of music and scholarship that, as Meirion Bowen claims, is essential to the modern repertoire.</p>
