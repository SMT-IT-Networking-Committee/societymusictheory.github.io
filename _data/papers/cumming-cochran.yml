title: "The <i>Questione della musica</i>: Revisiting the Origins of the Italian Madrigal"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>The origin of the madrigal is a recurring and unresolved topic in
  musicology. Did it evolve out of the frottola (Einstein 1949), the chanson and
  motet (Fenlon and Haar 1988) or Florentine song (Cummings 2004)? </p>
  <p>Fenlon, Haar, and Cummings agree that the madrigal emerged in Florence
  between 1515 and 1525. This period coincided with the heated debate, known as
  the <i>Questione della lingua</i>, about which type of Italian could rival
  classical Latin literature, and acquire the prestige to be accepted throughout
  the peninsula. While musicologists have recognized the importance of Pietro
  Bembo, there were many different positions on this issue. Florentine
  intellectuals involved in this debate (including Machiavelli, Martelli, and
  Trissino) met regularly in the Rucellai gardens (Cummings 2004), and also wrote
  texts for the early madrigal. </p>
  <p>We propose a Florentine <i>Questione della musica</i> parallel to the
  <i>Questione della lingua</i>: “Can we create a prestigious musical genre for
  settings of vernacular poetry?” Sacred Latin-texted music was at the top of the
  musical genre hierarchy, and widely disseminated across Europe. Our evidence
  shows that the early madrigal was consciously modeled on the motet, the musical
  genre that set sacred Latin poetry. </p>
  <p>The organization of the sources reveals the generic independence of the
  madrigal as well as its connection to the motet. The earliest madrigals, by
  Sebastiano Festa and Bernardo Pisano, appear mostly in Florentine manuscript
  partbooks (which also contain motets) rather than choirbooks: partbook format
  was previously reserved for Latin-texted music. When copied in sources
  containing other vernacular genres, madrigals are usually found in distinct
  sections, suggesting a generic identity from the beginning.</p>
  <p>Musically the early madrigal resembles the motet more than earlier Italian
  vernacular genres. Its use of varied textures, including both imitation and
  homorhythm, and its lack of both schematic repetition and additional stanzas of
  text, all resemble the motet. The distribution of modes in the madrigal differs
  from that of vernacular genres, and matches that of the motet (including use of
  E- and A-final pieces rarely found in earlier vernacular polyphony). The later
  sixteenth-century madrigal is often viewed as a “secular motet”—that was always
  the intent.</p>
