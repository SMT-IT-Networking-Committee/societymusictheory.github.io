abstract: |
    <p>Current analyses of medieval polyphony typically feature a contrapunctus
    reduction—an imaginative reverse-engineering of the complex surface back to
    consonant first species counterpoint of the kind recommended as a starting
    point in medieval composition manuals. This practice is designed to reveal
    aspects of 14th-century harmony, counterpoint, and tonality, and in this it
    has been indispensably fruitful. However, the rhythmic and metrical
    innovations from which Ars nova gets its name have been undervalued and
    underrepresented by this standard reductive method.</p>
    <p>While a contrapunctus analysis is not itself rhythmic, the analyst
    carefully considers rhythm when choosing pitches to include or exclude. My
    contrapunctus analyses go further, restoring and recreating medieval
    coloration to show grouping dissonances, following Krebs’s conception. This
    effect at multiple mensural levels is incorporated into my reductions by
    restoring rhythmic values and inserting guidelines in each part individually.
    While a modern act of analysis, my tonal and metrical judgments are rooted in
    the medieval concept of the <i>directed progression</i> (Fuller’s classic
    term). Because the arrival of perfect consonance defined Franconian metrical
    grouping, tracing directed progressions can allow one to draw a map of
    “downbeats,” sometimes grounded in a regular flow and sometimes scattering
    tonal accents transformative of the formal organization. I will examine the
    tonal implications of metrical dissonances in two motets of Machaut and will
    revisit Cordier’s famously eccentric rondeau “Tout par compas.” With metrical
    ingenuity represented inextricably with counterpoint, my rhythmicized
    contrapuncti capture a more comprehensive snapshot of the 14th-century’s
    subtle art.</p>
