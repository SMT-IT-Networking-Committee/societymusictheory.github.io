abstract: |
  <p>This paper investigates the aesthetic, experiential, and rhetorical links
  between atmospheric minimalism, psychedelic drug use, and hip highbrow
  lifestyle consumerism from 1960 to ’80. During this time period, composers,
  critics, and advertisers represented the minimal music listening experience as
  one of contemplative intoxication—akin to the psychedelic trip, but involving
  more awareness, concentration, and control on the part of the user. From the
  sleeve notes for Columbia’s 1968 premiere recording of Terry Riley’s <i>In
  C</i> (“The nature of your trip is determined by you”) to Atlantic’s
  <i>Environments</i> series of “psychological” ambient sound LPs (“A
  decongestant for the mind . . . Better than booze and safer than pot”) to
  Charlemagne Palestine’s droning multi-hour “meditative sound environments” to
  the inclusion of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela’s “continuous light and
  sound environments” in Edward Rosenfeld’s 1973 <i>The Book of Highs</i> (“250
  methods for altering your consciousness without drugs”) to Brian Eno’s 1978
  coinage of ambient music (a “surrounding influence” made to “induce calm”) and
  Peter Michael Hamel’s theorization of minimal music as <i>kontemplative
  Musik</i> (music to “aid self-absorption and contemplation, thus making drugs
  superfluous”), many of minimal music’s earliest purveyors fashioned
  electrified drones and loops as contemplative intoxicants: not hedonistic
  escapes from reality (see psychedelic rock, Muzak), but rather meditative
  vehicles for attaining inward focus and awareness. The retrospective labeling
  of minimalism and ambient music as coherent styles, I will argue, was
  inherently informed by the classed and gendered rhetoric of intoxication and
  self-control that validated these practices.</p>
