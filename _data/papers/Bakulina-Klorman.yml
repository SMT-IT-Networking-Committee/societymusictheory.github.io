abstract: | 
    <p>In the abundant literature on hypermeter, one aspect remains controversial—the cadence. Scholars have long debated about the normal hypermetrical placement of cadences. Some have argued that cadences are by definition accented (Riemann; Cone), others that the issue is stylistically contingent (Rothstein), while still others offer no preference whatsoever (Lerdahl/Jackendoff). Temperley (2003) and Ng (2012) have drawn attention to end-accent and resolution of ambiguity in closing sections. </p>
    <p>Our contribution focuses specifically on structural cadences (such as the EEC in Hepokoski/Darcy’s 2006 model of sonata form) and their potential to be disambiguating or focusing events. The tendency of subordinate themes toward loose-knit organization often introduces hypermetrical ambiguity, which is clarified precisely at the theme-ending cadence (i.e., the EEC). This cadence usually asserts a hyperdownbeat, thus triggering end-accented phrases in closing themes that Temperley (2003) has described. A “focal” cadence thus involves two things: a hypermetrical accent and a resolution of immediately preceding metrical conflicts. </p>
    <p>Three examples from late eighteenth-century instrumental music illustrate the argument; all of them have to do with subordinate themes. In W.A. Mozart’s sonata K. 457, irregular hypermeter and grouping resolves cadential arrival at m. 59, a hyperdownbeat. A similar scenario takes place in Hélène de Montgeroult’s sonata op. 1, no. 1. Finally, the subordinate theme in Mozart’s horn concerto K. 447 exhibits less ambiguity, but it does contain a hypermetrical reinterpretation at the focal EEC, which elides with the orchestral tutti. </p>
