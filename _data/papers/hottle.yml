abstract: |
    <p>Punch Brothers is a progressive bluegrass ensemble whose work defies
    genre categorization, invoking styles as disparate as country, rock, and
    art music. Their music is often metrically complex, but this complexity
    presents an analytical challenge, owing to their varied genre influences.
    I propose a comparative genre analysis of metric complexity in Punch
    Brothers, drawing on metric conventions common in bluegrass and in the
    music of Radiohead.</p>
    <p>Radiohead is often considered to be one of Punch Brothers’s biggest
    influences. I draw on Brad Osborn’s 2017 categorization of what he refers
    to as “metric salience” in Radiohead’s music to identify instances of
    metric complexity in Punch Brothers that are influenced by Radiohead.
    Building on Joti Rockwell’s (2011) exploration of metric disruptions in
    old-time country and bluegrass music, and James Palmer’s (2017)
    application of that work to Punch Brothers, I also characterize instances
    of metric complexity in Punch Brothers’s music that are primarily
    bluegrass-influenced. My comparison of these examples shows that Punch
    Brothers’s Radiohead-influenced metric complexity differs from their
    bluegrass-influenced metric complexity in three key ways: the use of
    non-isochronous (NI) meters, formal functions of metric disruptions, and
    preservation of the tactus.</p>
    <p>It is my hope that this work will pave the way for future comparative
    genre analyses, both within individual musician’s work and across artists.
    Comparisons of generic conventions, especially in the under-studied area
    of meter, can help us determine the features of meter that are common to a
    specific genre, and those that are more broadly used across genres.</p>
