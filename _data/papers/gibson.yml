    <p>The word monster comes from the Latin <em>monere</em>, which means to warn. Monsters warn. We disavow monsters to differentiate them from ourselves but the truth is that everyone has, couched within, monsters-in-waiting. We have a duty to regulate these monsters within.</p>
    <p>In a moment of self-reflection, and to paraphrase MJ, “I’ll start with the woman in the mirror.” Not so naïve as to feign innocence, I ask, what have I done? I lecture regularly on subjects as varied as blackface minstrelsy, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and Beethoven. I am not a proponent of “cancel culture,” yet in full disclosure, I can’t bring myself to watch <em>Surviving R. Kelly</em>, or <em>Leaving Neverland</em>—and it’s not because I don’t care to know, but rather because I think I know and I refuse to retraumatize myself for the sake of good “art” or good scholarship. Am I a hypocrite? Perhaps. Nevertheless, I remain open to changing my mind while staying ever mindful and protective of my own tender humanity.</p>
    <p>In the classroom I do my best to model a sense of curiosity in most things, which means that controversial topics are open for discussion. Students tell me it makes class meaningful. We set and maintain guidelines of mutual respect and monitor ourselves regularly. Music opens up channels to speak about what sometimes seems unspeakable in ordinary discourse. At the end of every semester a handful of students will sidle up to me and call me brave. I don’t feel brave. What I do feel is an obligation to help heal the wounds of the past, without doing harm, with and in care. Music allows us to broach difficult subjects in contained musical frames. Using music as a tool to talk about what’s eating us helps to regulate the monsters within. That’s not something to shirk, it’s something to treasure.</p>
