abstract: |
  <p>The premiere of Pietro Mascagni’s <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> in May 1890
  has long been regarded as a moment of operatic renewal in
  late-nineteenth-century Italy. Praised by Italian critic Francesco D’Arcais
  for its “indisputable italianità,” the opera made its first unpirated
  non-European appearances at Buenos Aires’s Teatro de la Opera in July 1891, as
  part of the winter tour of the Angelo Ferrari Company. Soon enough,
  <i>Cavalleria</i> was paired with Ruggero Leoncavallo’s <i>Pagliacci</i>
  (1892), in a double bill that circulated around Buenos Aires’s numerous
  theatres in ensuing seasons. The arrival of <i>Cavalleria</i> and
  <i>Pagliacci</i> in Argentina gained added resonance (and revenue) from the
  growing numbers of immigrants arriving in Buenos Aires from the Southern
  reaches of the Italian peninsula, emigrating in response to a series of
  agricultural and economic crises in Italy during the post-unification period.
  This situation was characterized by Italian writers as the “Southern
  Question,” and led Argentine authorities in turn to voice concerns over social
  disintegration caused by radical demographic change within Buenos Aires.</p>
  <p>This paper investigates the history of <i>Cavalleria</i> and
  <i>Pagliacci</i> in fin-de-siècle Buenos Aires, arguing for the centrality of
  Argentine perspectives in shaping understandings of Italian opera and
  italianità at this time. Recent musicological scholarship has underlined the
  contested position occupied by Italian opera in Argentina in response to
  emigration (Cetrangolo, 2015; Devoto, 2017) while historians of Italy have
  emphasized the role of foreign perceptions in shaping Italy’s self-image
  throughout the nineteenth century (Patriarca, 2007; Korner, 2017). I focus
  instead on Italian opera’s social and geographical mobility, drawing upon
  Argentine newspaper reports and fictional accounts—as well as the circulation
  of music in non-operatic contexts—to examine its complex position within the
  internationalized aesthetic hierarchies of Argentine theatres. This
  performance history, I argue, complicates easy connections between operatic
  and political discourse. If “Cav and Pag” initially registered as a
  problematically hybrid pairing—one that blurred national and aesthetic
  boundaries—its subsequent canonization outlines shifting understandings of the
  “popular” in Argentina at this time: a debate within which italianità could be
  re-imagined as a performative and potentially mediating space within the
  modern Argentine cosmopolis.</p>
