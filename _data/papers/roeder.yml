abstract: |
    <p>According to Lewin (1969), music theory describes how “composers and listeners appear to have accepted sound as conceptually structured.” He advised that for unfamiliar music—including music from “other cultures”—analysts need to foreground and explicate appropriate theories. I consider what concepts are relevant to <em>Whispers of a Gentle Wi</em>nd by Jia Guoping, a Beijing composer who exemplifies global modernism. The traditional Chinese instruments in this work do not seem to act as independent agents. Rather, it seems that an unseen energy elicits sounds from them, as a wind draws sonorities out of a natural environment. I consider how the Taoist concept of <em>qì</em> could characterize this energy flux. A spectrogram shows how energy in different frequency bands changes over time, how it mediates transitions between pitch and noise, and how segments are shaped and articulated, consistent with conceptions of <em>qì</em> balance.</p>
    <p>I then demonstrate that such an approach has a global, comparative application: to Helmut Lachenmann’s <em>Allegro Sostenuto</em>. Jia studied with Lachenmann, so this similarity is anchored in a concrete historical context. A spectrogram shows that the first section features a varying flow of energy very similar to Jia’s. Thus, although the two works’ pitch structures stake out distinctive music-cultural identities, I argue that a concept resonant with Chinese culture permits analytically productive connections to both of them. The comparison thus resists the tendency—both in anglophone theory and in China itself—to analyze Chinese modernist music in Western terms.</p>
