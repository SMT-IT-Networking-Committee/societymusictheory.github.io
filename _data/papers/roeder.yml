title: "The RICH logic of Thomas Adès’s <i>The Exterminating Angel</i> and
<i>The Tempest</i>"

abstract: |
    <p>Thomas Adès described the composition of his operas <i>The Tempest</i>
    (2003) and <i>The Exterminating Angel</i> (2016) as the “organic,
    necessary” linking of “tiny cells” into larger structures by a “musical
    logic.” Observations by Cao, Gallon, and Venn suggest that the pertinent
    cells are simply dyads. This paper demonstrates how, in both operas, the
    logic of the dyad successions is a transformational one, consisting of
    retrograde-inversion chaining (RICH).</p>
    <p>In <i>The Tempest</i>, the basis for the RICH chain is a voice leading
    of a perfect fifth to a minor third. Reiterating RICH thrice carries the
    progression back to the initial dyad, forming a short cycle, which Adès
    assembles into larger cyclic structures that endow each dyad with an
    ensemble of possible continuations, closures, denials, and surprises. The
    chains direct the protagonists’ musics in ways that express Prospero’s
    power and Caliban’s resistance.</p>
    <p>Such RICH logic, applied to different materials, also permeates <i>The
    Exterminating Angel</i>. In this case the RI-chaining constitutes an
    octatonic structure that in some passages may be heard to represent the
    eponymous force that dissipates the characters’ will. But the progression
    is also used to underwrite more purely musical structures. For instance,
    it generates the tonal plan of the Act I lovers’ duet, and it coordinates
    pitch, rhythm, tonality, and form in the “Fugue of Panic.” Most
    dramatically significant, though, is the role that RI-chains play in the
    pivotal moment of the opera, when Leticia’s defiant singing releases the
    guests from the “abulia” that traps them.</p>
