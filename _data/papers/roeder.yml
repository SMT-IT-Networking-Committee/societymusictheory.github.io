abstract: |
    <p>Chen Yi’s <i>Ba Ban</i> (1999) for solo piano, like many works of
    Western-trained Chinese composers, situates fragments of evocative
    traditional folk melody within a post-tonal discourse that is well
    described by transformation theory. The eponymous <i>qupai</i> (“named
    tune”) that it quotes is a standard of the <i>sizhu</i>
    (“silk-and-bamboo”) repertoire of Jiangnan and elsewhere (Thrasher 1989).
    In <i>sizhu</i> performance practice, the evenly pulsed rhythm of the
    68-beat melody is greatly augmented and each pitch is highly “flowered,”
    that is, decorated. Even the plain version of the tune has a distinctive
    temporality that arises from its multivalent grouping structure (Roeder
    2011), but the partly improvised flowering process also affords special
    sensations of time that are simultaneously unpredictable locally yet
    highly directed across longer timespans. Chen’s piece, often simulating
    the timbral quality of <i>sizhu</i> heterophony with mistuned octaves,
    reproduces some of these temporal qualities by quoting distinctive phrases
    and elaborating their pitches. Intermingled with this discourse, though,
    it presents multilinear threads of motivic transformation through virtuoso
    figurations typical of Western piano repertoire. This paper examines how
    the distinctive pitch, rhythmic, and grouping continuity of the tune
    sometimes takes command of the otherwise transformational temporality of
    these post-tonal materials, while at other times the transformational
    logic fractures and absorbs it. Without presuming compositional intent,
    but in tribute to the 30th anniversary of the SMT CSW, I suggest how this
    hybridity might resonate with some ideas of third-wave feminist
    theory.</p>
