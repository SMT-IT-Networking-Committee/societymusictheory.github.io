    <p>This paper proposes a new method of <strong>comparativism called “global sonic genealogy” that</strong> actively disrupts the outdated notion of <em>discrete</em> cultures embodied in musics, a notion premised on a colonial-capitalist musical ontology that emerged in the 16<sup>th</sup> century (Sykes 2019). Rather than simply applying old methods to new repertoire in the theory and analysis of “traditional” world music, we should refurbish our discipline’s Eurocentric conceptual foundation, in which self and other are bifurcated into the traditional and the modern. I proceed by taking a page from the emerging field of global music history (Strohm 2019), refocusing that view of the <em>longue durée</em> on music theory’s traditional emphasis on sonic objects. Four historical conceptions of the pentatonic scale are articulated by (1) scholars in the ancient China court before 221 BC, (2) the missionary Father Jean Joseph Marie Amiot in China in the 18<sup>th</sup>-century, (3) 19<sup>th</sup> century composers in the US, and, (4) the Texas-born composer John Sharpley who migrated to Singapore in 1986. A global sonic genealogy (GSG) of pentatonicism fundamentally disrupts the hoary (16<sup>th</sup>-century European), common-sense conception of discrete cultures. Tracing pentatonicism across the 4 cases, GSG embodies a new paradigm of <em>normative</em> circulation across time and place, displacing <em>monocultural</em> siloes which mandate the language of “inter-” in the first place. GSG embodies a fundamentally different, global ontology and epistemology that axiomatically refute containment in cultural boxes.</p>
