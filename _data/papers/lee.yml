    <p>Unsuk Chin has often spoken of her passion for astronomy and cosmology, referring to phenomena such as the big bang and celestial light as inspirations for her music. Elsewhere, she has described her compositional process as linear, where the initial musical moment prescribes the course of a work. Taking these remarks as points of departure, this paper explores Chin’s compositional processes in three pieces from various points of her career, including the Piano Concerto (1997), Piano Etude No. 5 (2003), and the Cello Concerto (2013). I argue that the expansion and collapse of musical texture—resembling the life cycle of celestial objects—is a vital element of the formal processes in Chin’s music. </p>
    <p>Like celestial objects, the initial ideas in these works serve as the musical core, around which a sort of anti-gravitational tension is created through textural changes. Such changes include pitch contents veering away from the core, the “composing out” of a harmonic spectrum, or the expansion of rhythm, instrumentation, and dynamics in tandem with disintegration of the pitch centrality. When the “gravitational pull” reaches a certain threshold, the music often collapses onto the initial moment, reintroducing the central pitch or rhythm materials as other musical events subside; these collapses mark significant structural points on both the local and macro levels. I compare Chin’s approach to structural principles in Ligeti’s work to contextualize her use of textural development as structural processes among other recent strategies, as well as to underscore the ethereal and expansive qualities of her music. </p>
