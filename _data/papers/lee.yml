title: "The Arrival 6/4 Chord in Wagner’s <i>Die Walküre</i>: Types and Functions"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Coined by Robert Hatten, the “arrival 6/4” is a cadential 6/4 that resolves
  tonal or thematic instabilities without necessarily proceeding to V(7).
  Despite its structural subordination and status as a transitional chord in the
  cadential process, the arrival 6/4 sounds rhetorically stable in the moment it
  occurs. The chord has been discussed, most notably by Hatten and Klein, in
  reference to instrumental music by Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin; I expand
  the application of the arrival 6/4 to analysis of opera, arguing that the
  chord is an effective tool for analyzing Wagner’s harmonic process. </p>
  <p>Cadential avoidance and thwart dominate Wagner’s musical progressions. In
  the midst of this “musical prose,” even a cadential gesture—not requiring
  subsequent fulfillment—provides a point of enormous expectation for aural and
  emotional relief. In this context, a cadential 6/4 produces tonal and harmonic
  illumination as an aurally <i>marked</i> moment, instigating expectation for
  subsequent cadential completion. I categorize these arrival 6/4 chords
  according to whether they ultimately resolve or become I6/4 chords.</p>
  <p>The present paper establishes Wagner’s strategic use of the arrival 6/4
  chord through analysis of selected excerpts from <i>Die Walküre</i>.
  Furthermore, these analyses examine the context of the chord beyond the moment
  of its occurrence, investigating and comparing their distinct locations,
  relations to the preceding and following passages, kinetic gestures, and
  psychological effects. In this way, I provide refined interpretations of each
  chord’s harmonic function and gestural meaning within its unique operatic
  context. </p>
