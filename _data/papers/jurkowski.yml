abstract: |
  <p>Though Milton Babbitt’s <i>Composition for Tenor and Six Instruments</i>
  and <i>Sounds and Words</i> (both released 1960) predate the release of his
  first electronic works, their composition follows concerted experimentation
  with the RCA synthesizer, in the years 1958–59. Commentators like Mead and
  Bernstein recognize these as transitional works, and I believe that their ties
  to the electronic medium can be further explored. A number of aspects of
  <i>Sounds and Words, </i>in particular, seem informed by Babbitt’s experiments
  with the synthesizer.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I examine<i> Sounds and Words </i>in the context of the
  capabilities of both the synthesizer and of competent human performers. The
  temporal and rhythmic serialization scheme in the piece reflects a structure
  that relates quite naturally to the clock-time/code-intake-speed orientation
  of the synthesizer, and the proto-serialization of timbre through vocal
  phonemes anticipates works like <i>Phonemena </i>(1975).<i> </i>I also analyze
  passages of a performance of the work by Bethany Beardslee and Robert Helps to
  see the extent to which they are able to accurately perform the piece,
  concluding that given the work’s rhythmic difficulty, it would be unreasonable
  to expect a completely accurate performance, even from extremely skilled
  performers. Examining these findings in the context of Babbitt’s contemporary
  thought on the link between a work’s serial structure and the work’s musical
  meaning helps to suggest both how the electronic medium influenced the
  development of his methods of serializing rhythm and timbre, and his decision
  to turn increasingly to composing for the synthesizer in the 1960s and
  1970s.</p>
