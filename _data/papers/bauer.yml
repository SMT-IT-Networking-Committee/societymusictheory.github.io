    <p>Critic Joshua Kosman noted that Thomas Adès’s <i>In Seven Days: Piano
    Concerto with Moving Image </i>(2008) “seems to want to embrace the whole
    world.” The concerto outlines the Biblical creation story in seven
    connected movements, accompanied by coordinated projections by video
    artist Tal Rosner based on images of the two venues that commissioned the
    work (London’s Royal Festival Hall and Los Angeles’s Disney Hall). <i>In
    Seven Days</i> merges the figurative and the abstract to parallel modern
    allegorical readings of Biblical creation. A theme and series of seven
    variations outline successive “days” illustrated by specific musical
    devices, the whole divided into two halves that appear to follow the
    framework interpretation of Genesis.</p>
    <p>The musical allegory presented by <i>In Seven Days</i> suggests a
    creation shaped as much by implicit scientific principles as the
    theological notion of a supreme being. The piano functions in this context
    less as a virtuosic soloist than a guiding force, a “consciousness” that
    directs the expansion of the work, drives the generation of harmonic and
    rhythmic patterns, and occasionally arrives, in medias res, to comment on
    the work of creation. A separate musical narrative runs in parallel to the
    narrative of Biblical creation—one shaped by the refinement of Western
    musical techniques, such as canon, which themselves display a cyclical
    history of musical development from early polyphony through 20th-century
    modernism and minimalism. Hence, the paper concludes by demonstrating that
    the “whole world” of <i>In Seven Days</i> embraces a musical creation myth
    as well.</p>
