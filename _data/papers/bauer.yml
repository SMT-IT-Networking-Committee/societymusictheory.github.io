abstract: |
  <p>This paper considers some of San Antonio’s most iconic and innovative
  artists who have reinterpreted the music to reflect their own sense of
  cultural identity in the modern world. As scholars like Manuel Peña have
  effectively argued, conjunto music initially served as a counter-response to
  the hegemony of Anglo-Americans and upward-aspiring Texas Mexicans. In the
  case of these musicians, globalization occurs through cross-cultural
  interactions at the border of Texas-Mexican heritage with physical and
  increasingly digital processes of migration throughout the United States.
  These interactions have led to a system of hybridization in which musicians
  combine traditional conjunto practices with songs and stylistic
  characteristics from mainstream American culture, including both Anglo and
  African American cultural influences. Local musicians create their own
  cultural spaces as individual negotiations of global forms, using creative
  elements that best represent their own interpretations of the contemporary
  world. They situate and authenticate their music through the sounds of
  Texas-Mexican conjunto and simultaneously draw connections with other cultural
  populations to create an identity more closely tied to the mainstream
  community.</p>
