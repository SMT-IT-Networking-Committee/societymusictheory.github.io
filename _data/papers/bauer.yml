abstract: |
    <p>Widespread recognition of global modernism in music has yet to affect the ontology of “new music” as category, or to challenge the distinctions between musical center and periphery. The appropriation of folk or non-Western material within an art music context may be marked as “exotic” even as it is lauded as an intercultural contribution to modernism as ideal. Yet the non-European composer who chooses to forgo ethnic signifiers may face censure for ignoring the unspoken rules that shape the cosmopolitan imaginary of our time. As a case study I reflect on the neglected late music of Carlos Chávez as it reflects the fraught historiography of musical modernism writ large.</p>
    <p>The abstract language and denial of repetition in Chávez’s latter works share in a spirit of “eternal development” that foreshadows that of European New Complexity; they prove as resistant to traditional methods of post-tonal analysis as to the folkloric semiosis that characterized analyses of the composer’s earlier works. I position these late works as Chavez’s bid to finally be accepted as a cosmopolitan modernist, with all the paradoxical connotations that label implies. Their composition and reception history took place within a cultural framework shaped by the binary opposition of social imaginaries: a continental tradition informed by social theory and Frankfurt school aesthetics versus an Anglo-American positivist ideal. Such competing imaginaries mark the critical, dialectical and self-reflexive character of late modernity broadly, especially in music, where structural abstractions combine with local materialities to reflect the “character of the universal” (Oesch 1981).</p>
