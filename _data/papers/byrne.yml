abstract: |
  <p>The location and representation of the diminished seventh (dim7) chord in
  pitch space present challenges to neo-Riemannian and related theories. The
  dim7 chord does not contain a major third, and thus cannot be uniquely reduced
  to a consonant triadic subset. While expansion to three dimensions enables
  representation of dominant and half-diminished sevenths (Vogel 1975; Gollin
  1998), the location of the dim7 chord remains variable. In this paper, I
  examine how German composer and theorist Sigfrid Karg-Elert (1877–1933)
  situated the dim7 chord within his three-dimensional fifth/third/seventh pitch
  space (1930), which was essentially new for its time, and is identical to
  Gollin’s except for its retention of just intonation and therefore its
  infinite expanse. Karg-Elert’s pitch space contains three differently-sized
  minor thirds, and thus numerous possible types of dim7 chords. After rejecting
  three possibilities, Karg-Elert describes two different “shapes” of dim7 chord
  that are viable harmonies with clearly definable functional meanings. One has
  precedents in earlier writings by Riemann and Eitz, while the other is
  original to Karg-Elert, containing an interval generated by the third
  dimension of his pitch space. I begin by locating Karg-Elert’s dim7 chords in
  the space, demonstrated using 3D Tonnetze, and aural realizations in just
  intonation. I then consider the functional meanings of the two viable dim7
  chords (plus hybrids of both types), in relation to Harrison’s discussion of
  functional mixture in the dim7 chord (Harrison 1994). Karg-Elert’s
  presentation enriches our conception of the diminished seventh chord, and
  vividly demonstrates his prodigious exploration of three-dimensional pitch
  space.</p>
