    <p>In treatises published in 1930 and 1931, German composer and theorist Sigfrid Karg-Elert (1877–1933) presented a complete system of harmonic transformations involving triads and dominant (or half-diminished) seventh chords. His transformations emphasize retention of common tones, as in the PLR operations of “neo-Riemannian” theory. Karg-Elert’s system was inspired by Hugo Riemann’s <em>Schritte</em> and <em>Wechsel</em> (1880), which relate major and minor triads without regard for tonality or function. A crucial difference is that while Riemann’s transformations implicitly assume equal temperament and enharmonic equivalence, Karg-Elert’s system operates in a three-dimensional just intonation space defined by the pure fifth, major third and harmonic seventh, spanning a potentially infinite number of distinct pitches. While Riemann (1880) invariably explains a motion from C major to E major as <em>Terzschritt</em> (“major third step”), Karg-Elert provides multiple interpretations, reflecting the specific pitch-space locations of each triad.</p>
    <p>After summarizing the principal features of Karg-Elert’s transformational system, I examine his 1931 discussion of the <em>Schlafakkorde</em> (the “Magic Sleep” leitmotif) from Act III of Wagner’s <em>Die Walküre</em>. He first considers the passage from a middleground perspective, focusing on the mediant transformations that link its key areas; this analysis presents notable similarities with Brian Hyer’s 1995 investigation of the <em>Schlafakkorde</em>, and also prefigures David Lewin’s “arrow” notation for transformational networks. Karg-Elert then provides a foreground interpretation of each chord-to-chord motion that illustrates his concept of comma-free modulation. His two contrasting analyses demonstrate how harmonic transformations can reflect both local and global perceptions, and can reveal a sense of tonal hierarchy.</p>
