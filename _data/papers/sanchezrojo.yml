  <p><i>La Nina</i> premiered in Madrid in May of 1790, immediately capturing
  the city’s attention and remaining long thereafter a paragon of musical
  theater. The Madrid Italian opera theater of Los Canos del Peral had been open
  for only three years, with Cimarosa and Paisiello as favorite composers, and
  Metastasio as the most revered librettist. Yet <i>La Nina</i> spoke to the
  Madrid public in a new language. Through a tour of the multifaceted presences
  of <i>Nina</i> in Madrid during the 1790s, this presentation will show that
  for the Spanish audiences, <i>La Nina</i>’s sentimental characters represented
  a new, “modern” way of interacting with the world according to natural law. In
  the words of Stefano Castelvecchi, “Europe was reduced to tears by Paisiello’s
  <i>Nina</i>” (Castelvecchi, <i>Sentimental Opera</i>, 127). Spain was no
  exception.</p>
  <p>Besides the appeal of sentimentality, two aspects bore relevance for the
  Spanish elite: the natural-pastoral environment, and Nina’s forced marriage
  that led to her madness. Both topics occupied an important role in the
  large-scale cultural and economic reforms of the late Bourbon rules, designed
  to launch the Spanish nation into progress. Since <i>La Nina</i> in its
  original version (Lorenzi/Paisiello, 1789) featured spoken dialog, like
  zarzuela, it appealed to Spanish preferences more than standard operas with
  recitative. <i>La Nina</i>’s first impact extended from 1790 into the entire
  decade. Nina’s story was reimagined as a pantomime ballet in 1793. A Spanish
  adaptation of the two-act Italian version (also by Paisiello) was performed in
  the city theaters in 1795 and 1797, and even special-edition fans were
  produced at the National Fan Factory to bring Nina and Lindoro to the everyday
  lives of their admirers. </p>
  <p>The early reception of <i>La Nina</i> in Madrid opens a window into the
  main topics of the late Spanish Enlightenment, linking the opera’s gestural
  sentimentality to sensationism theories in the tradition of Locke and
  Condillac. Because it did not include recitative, <i>La Nina</i> was spared of
  the criticism of musical excess often argued against Italian opera. Instead,
  it stood for a truly reformed musical theater, which fulfilling Horace’s
  precept, pleased and educated the Spanish public.</p>
