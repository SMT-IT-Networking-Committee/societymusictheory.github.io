    <p>This presentation examines the relationship between salience and stability in a performance by Robert Glasper. Triadic voicings such as slash chords, upper structures, and “So What” chords are highly idiomatic in jazz. The triads are salient in these voicings due to their placement in the upper register, but are usually unstable, being composed mostly or entirely of upper chord tones. Triads may be used similarly in melodic improvisation, where they are more salient than comping chords or rhythm section accompaniment. Because there are so many varieties of triadic voicings, a given triad may be used to realize numerous harmonies. When triadic voicings are used successively, they may form transformational pathways that are worthy of study in their own right. Moreover, such transformations may counterpoint those of the stable, lower chord tones in significant ways. </p>
    <p>“North Portland” is a typical Glasper composition in its lack of a clear tonal center, its avoidance of dominant harmonies, its tertian melodic structures, and its emphasis on <em><strong>S</strong></em> and <em><strong>LP</strong>/<strong>PL</strong></em> transformations. Glasper’s improvisation on the tune is replete with triadic transformations in the right-hand melodic line that interact compellingly with those of the underlying form, exemplifying the concept of transformational counterpoint. The metric counterpoint between the salient and stable levels is also explored.</p>
