abstract: |
  <p>On 30 May 1940, ten days before Mussolini declared war on Britain and
  France, Italy’s nationalized radio broadcasting station—the Ente Italiano per
  le Audizioni Radiofoniche (EIAR)—released a film in commercial theaters. Aptly
  titled <i>Ecco la radio!</i>, the film sought to make visible the music and
  narration listeners heard each day on the radio, beginning with the
  announcer’s morning greetings, followed by a series of humorously disjunct
  narratives, from an adventurer hunting a cannibalistic tribe to a
  violin-toting devil tormenting a bewigged nobleman. Featuring some of the most
  famous Italian radio personalities of the time, <i>Ecco la radio!</i> was
  EIAR’s second major attempt to capitalize on the popularity of radio stars in
  a different venue. The network had recently funded a popular traveling variety
  show starring many of the same singers and performers that traveled to
  forty-four Italian cities over its three-month engagement and resulted in
  multiple radio broadcasts and recordings. In this paper, I demonstrate that
  these performances were products of the close ties and mutual reinforcements
  between EIAR, the recorded music industry, film production, and the state.

  <p>Drawing on work by scholars of fascism including Marcia Landy and Victoria
  de Grazia, I argue that such cross-medial performances exhibited traces of an
  Americanism identified by Antonio Gramsci as indispensable to a cultural
  politics of the masses and to the international success of the cinema. As a
  state-granted monopoly financed by both commercial advertising revenue and
  subscription fees, EIAR was characterized by an innate tension between
  commercial and political interests. By extending its reach into film and live
  performance, the network strove to appeal to middle-class listeners who might
  purchase a radio set and subscription and to build a mass consumer market with
  distinctly nationalist overtones. <i>Ecco la radio!</i> and its live
  counterpart, <i>Viva la radio!</i>, reveal how, on the eve of the Second World
  War, cultural institutions like radio and cinema could offer the appearance of
  internationalism and change while also participating in the dissemination of
  populist consumerism and Fascist propaganda.</p>
