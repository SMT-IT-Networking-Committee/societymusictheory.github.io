abstract: |
    <p>Giorgio Antoniotto’s 1760 treatise <i>L’arte armonica</i>,<i> </i>with
    subscribers including Burney, Arne, Hawkins and Dr. Johnson, is presented here
    as a link between Rameau and Riemann. Using Rameau’s fundamental bass,
    Antoniotto generates scales from sequential perfect fifths. He posits two
    systems: Natural (diatonic) and General (chromatic). In the latter, he
    explores the complete chromatic, whole-tone scales, and major- and minor-third
    cycles. His grid of the General moves by perfect fifths horizontally and
    vertically, with one diagonal a whole-tone scale, and the other unisons.
    Another example shows whole-tone lines in the soprano, tenor and bass parts,
    with a chromatic line in the alto. He demonstrates a major-third cycle
    (C-E-G#-C) in yet another example, and in a fourth, a minor-third cycle passes
    through the major keys of C, A, F# and Eb, before returning to C major.
    Euler’s 1739 “genus diatonicum chromaticum” and 1774 “Speculum Musicum” are
    considered forerunners of the Neo-Riemannian <i>Tonnetz</i>, and Antoniotto
    has no grid precisely equivalent to Euler’s discoveries.  However, he does
    create one in which the horizontal and vertical axes consist of Natural
    (diatonic) thirds, with one diagonal perfect fifths, and the other unisons. In
    addition to exploring Antoniotto’s concepts, I place them in the context of
    contemporary geometric representations of musical structures, by Euler,
    Hartung (1749), Mace (1676), Butler (1636) and Smith (1759).</p>
