title: Generalized Normal Forms
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>This talk strengthens the connections between pitch-class set theory
    (Forte et al.) and geometric music theory (Callender, Quinn, Tymoczko) by
    showing that generalized versions of “normal forms” or “prime forms” may
    be derived under any combination of the <i>OPTIC</i> equivalence
    relations. In this conception, the usual “normal order” of a collection of
    notes is its <i>OPC</i> normal form, inasmuch as all collections sharing
    the same normal order are related by some combination of octave,
    permutational, and cardinality equivalence. The familiar “prime form” is
    the <i>OPTIC</i> normal form, which relies on transpositional and
    inversional equivalence as well. Calculation of normal forms corresponding
    to other subsets of the <i>OPTIC</i> relations helps to clarify ways in
    which different sets or strings of notes may be related; as more relations
    are added, more things become equivalent, and normal forms become simpler.
    Normal forms provide a systematic means, previously lacking, for labeling
    maps of <i>OPTIC</i> spaces, and may be used to define <i>normal
    regions</i>, useful aids to visualizing the smaller spaces that arise
    through the addition of new relations to those already present in some
    larger space. The talk will review the <i>OPTIC</i> relations, present a
    detailed algorithm for the calculation of all normal forms, and offer
    examples of normal forms, normal regions, and ways in which they may be
    used.</p>
