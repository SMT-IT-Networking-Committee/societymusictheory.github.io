abstract: | 
    <p>Florence Price employs a combination of Western-European compositional techniques and Black vernacular music styles in her four-movement piano suite, <em>Thumbnail Sketches: A Day in the Life of a Washerwoman</em>. In this piece, the use of African American musical styles gives a voice to the titular character, a Black Washerwoman, an all but forgotten figure in American history. Building upon the work of Horace Maxile Jr., I utilize his five African American topics (Call-and-Response, Signifyin(g), Spiritual/Supernatural, Blues, and Jazz) to highlight how Black vernacular music styles are employed by Price in her piano suite. These five topics not only appear together, but often work collaboratively with, or at times against, more traditional European compositional techniques such as tonal planning and classical forms. I examine each movement and offer analytical insights of the topics in use and their relationship to a programmatic reading of the piece. While the evocation of these musical styles is clearly present throughout this work, I highlight how the application of Maxile’s topics allow for a nuanced reading of works where the use of these styles is not as evident. In this analysis, by viewing Florence Price’s use of these musical styles in <em>Thumbnail Sketches</em>, we come to see how Price was able to offer an authentic voice to an often silenced and forgotten figure in American history, the Black washerwoman. </p>
