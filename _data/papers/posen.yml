abstract: |
    <p>In this paper, I analyze double-tonic complexes as bistable phenomena that
    arise from the collision of two relative-related keys using Gershwin’s
    Concerto in F as a case study. The double-tonic complex (Bailey 1985) has
    inspired studies that investigate tonal pairing, juxtaposition, or conflation
    of more than one key at a variety of structural levels in the music of several
    19th-century composers (e.g., Lewis 1984; Kinderman and Krebs 1996). By
    adapting the work of Harrison 1994 and Swinden 2005, I create a
    music-theoretic parallel to a neural network model developed by Stadler and
    Kruse 1995 that models our perception of bistable images, for example, the
    rabbit-duck illusion. I propose treating conflated double-tonics as the
    collision of two keys’ tonics that produces two bistable tonics, for example,
    an F-minor seventh-chord and an added-sixth A♭-major tetrachord. I refashion
    Swinden’s superscript-notation to emphasize both states (e.g.,
    Foreground-Key/Alternate-Key). To develop further this bistable
    interpretation, I introduce bistable dominants and investigate their
    voice-leading implications in a bistable dominant-to-tonic model. A harmonic,
    collision-based approach accentuates the paradox of bistable keys: both keys
    function as stable states, but because there remains a possibility of
    switching between them, the stability of each key is partially undermined by
    the other. Treating conflated, double-tonic complexes as bistable phenomena
    inspires compelling narratives for interpreting Gershwin’s Concerto and other
    pieces that have similar double-tonic complexes.</p>
