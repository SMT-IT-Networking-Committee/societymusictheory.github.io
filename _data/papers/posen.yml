    <p>In this paper, I reconstruct the first three single-line, continuity sketches of Beethoven’s <em>Eroica</em> exposition (Lockwood and Gosman 2013) into “proto-pieces” by realizing the harmonies and textures that the single-voice sketches imply. Using Caplin’s (1998, 2013) theory of formal functions, I analyze these proto-pieces to elucidate and compare Beethoven’s formal and phrase-structural strategies. I argue that the sketches show Beethoven’s multiple innovative approaches for problematizing a lyrical subordinate theme in order to elevate rhetorically the arrival of a new lyrical theme in the development, which parallels Adorno’s analysis of the final published piece (Vande Moortele 2015).</p>
    <p>For example, in the first exposition sketch, Beethoven writes a modulating transition that moves chromatically through three distant tonal areas. Thereupon he builds an energetic subordinate theme, part 1 (ST<sup>1</sup>), while avoiding a lyrical ST<sup>2</sup> by bringing back main-theme material in the same keys that were foreshadowed earlier. In the second sketch, Beethoven omits the tonally innovative ST<sup>2</sup> from the first sketch and instead writes a fake exposition repeat—a remarkable rhetorical ploy whereby the new ST<sup>2</sup> material sounds like a codetta, a re-transition, and a seeming restart of the exposition.</p>
    <p>In reconstructing and analyzing the sketches with form-functional theory, I seek a new approach for understanding the <em>Eroica</em> sketches. Instead of characterizing passages in the sketches that differ from the published version as problems that Beethoven revised or purged to create an artistic piece, I valorize them to form a more complete “biography” of the work through its fascinating compositional genesis.</p>
