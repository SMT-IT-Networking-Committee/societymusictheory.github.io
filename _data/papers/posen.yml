    <p>In addition to fugues being rare in Broadway musicals, Bernstein’s
    “Cool Fugue” from <i>West Side Story </i>(1957)<i> </i>is anything but
    typical. It might seem surprising to recognize that, in a work intended to
    sell tickets in the popular sphere, Bernstein included not only a fugue,
    but a <i>serial</i> fugue. In this paper, I use set-theoretic and
    transformational tools to show how Bernstein’s “Cool Fugue” from <i>West
    Side Story </i>(1957) not only opens with a twelve-tone row, but is also
    structured according to twelve-tone serial principles in its entirety. I
    analyze aspects of the row and interpret the relationship of subject and
    answer components by shifting axes of inversion that cause wedging. I
    formalize these relationships with Klumpenhouwer Networks and show how the
    networks share positive network isography with set class 3-5 (016), a set
    class that many of the important motives and even <i>Leitmotivs</i>
    share.</p>

    <p>In the process of analysis, I comment on the phenomenology of even and
    odd indexes of inversion as they relate to the Transposition Hyperoperator
    &lt;T<sub>n</sub>&gt;. Finally, to show the cyclical serial organization of the
    fugue, I use Hook’s <i>Uniform Triadic Transformations </i>to model the
    group of alternating subject and answer components. I show how the serial
    process interacts with—and helps define—the unfolding fugal process.
    Although some scholars suggest that Bernstein reinforced pejorative myths
    of twelve-tone music as a fad of the postwar period, he too “fooled with
    serialism” and his own serial pieces sometimes made it into places we
    might least expect.</p>
