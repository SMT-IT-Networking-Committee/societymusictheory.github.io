        <p>Thomas Posen is a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate in Music Theory at McGill University with active research in Beethoven sketch studies and compositional process, the history of music theory, and the music of Leonard Bernstein and George Gershwin. His dissertation examines and reappraises Beethoven’s compositional process to his <em>Eroica</em> symphony by reconstructing the sketches and analyzing the reconstructions with form-function theory. Thomas has presented his work at numerous national and international conferences including SMT, AMS, multiple regional conferences, and international conferences such as the Medieval and Renaissance Music Conference in Basel, Switzerland, the Modes, Church Tones, Tonality: Tonal Spaces, c. 1550–1720 in Ferrara, Italy (2018), and the Beethoven 2020 Conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands (2020). He has won best student paper awards in both music theory and musicology in regional conferences for his work on Leonard Bernstein’s music to <em>West Side Story</em> (1957). He holds a B.M. in Piano Performance, a B.A. in Physics and Astrophysics <em>summa cum laude</em>, and a dual concentration M.M. in Piano Performance and Music Theory from the University of New Mexico.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>In this paper, I reconstruct the first three single-line, continuity sketches of Beethoven’s <em>Eroica</em> exposition (Lockwood and Gosman 2013) into “proto-pieces” by realizing the harmonies and textures that the single-voice sketches imply. Using Caplin’s (1998, 2013) theory of formal functions, I analyze these proto-pieces to elucidate and compare Beethoven’s formal and phrase-structural strategies. I argue that the sketches show Beethoven’s multiple innovative approaches for problematizing a lyrical subordinate theme in order to elevate rhetorically the arrival of a new lyrical theme in the development, which parallels Adorno’s analysis of the final published piece (Vande Moortele 2015).</p>
    <p>For example, in the first exposition sketch, Beethoven writes a modulating transition that moves chromatically through three distant tonal areas. Thereupon he builds an energetic subordinate theme, part 1 (ST<sup>1</sup>), while avoiding a lyrical ST<sup>2</sup> by bringing back main-theme material in the same keys that were foreshadowed earlier. In the second sketch, Beethoven omits the tonally innovative ST<sup>2</sup> from the first sketch and instead writes a fake exposition repeat—a remarkable rhetorical ploy whereby the new ST<sup>2</sup> material sounds like a codetta, a re-transition, and a seeming restart of the exposition.</p>
    <p>In reconstructing and analyzing the sketches with form-functional theory, I seek a new approach for understanding the <em>Eroica</em> sketches. Instead of characterizing passages in the sketches that differ from the published version as problems that Beethoven revised or purged to create an artistic piece, I valorize them to form a more complete “biography” of the work through its fascinating compositional genesis.</p>
