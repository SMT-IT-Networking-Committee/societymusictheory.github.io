abstract: |
    <p>Many rock songs have a puzzling feature: despite ostensibly simple
    harmonic structures, it is not entirely clear what key they are in. The
    standard analytical response to these situations is to claim
    <i>ambiguity</i> or <i>competition </i>among the possible key centers and
    frame a narrative interpretation around this ambiguity. However, the
    assumption of monotonality in the rock repertoire bears examination,
    especially the notion that the absence of a single pitch center implies
    conflict. Might rock tonality allow for multiple tonal centers to exist not
    in conflict but as equal members of a governing tonal structure?</p>

    <p>In this paper, I propose that some seemingly ambiguous rock songs exhibit
    the theoretical structure known as the “double-tonic complex.” Not just
    “tonal pairing”—the alternation of two equally weighted keys—but a true
    Robert Bailey-style double tonic: a four-note sonority built from the union
    of two third-related triads acting as prolonged tonic. Though the
    double-tonic complex has proven controversial in 19th-century
    scholarship, rock music’s particularities provide a ripe environment for
    double-tonic structures, with its common use of seventh chords as stable
    harmonies and Aeolian modality. I investigate three double-tonic situations:
    1) a surface intertwining of two relative keys such that both tonics act
    <i>simultaneously</i> as gravitational centers; 2) multi-section works
    in which each of the two keys is central for portions but neither
    emerges as the global tonic; and 3) songs with looped chord progressions
    that do not settle on a particular tonic.</p>
