abstract: |
    <p>Reports of the chorus’s death have been increasing in pop-critical
    circles. Indeed, after decades of “don’t bore us, get to the chorus,” many
    recent pop songs place their focus away from their choruses, subverting
    normative formal models and opening up space for teleological climax to
    occur elsewhere. One particular subversive technique pervades post-2010
    pop music: after a textural buildup in a verse and prechorus, the chorus
    begins with a sudden and extreme drop in energy, negating any release of
    tension and making the chorus the song’s point of lowest energy. In this
    paper, I investigate the hermeneutics of these "anti-telos choruses,"
    drawing analytical examples from Top-40 hits of the current decade.</p>
    <p>Anti-telos choruses in general serve two expressive purposes. First,
    they engender a sense of intimacy between song persona and listener.
    Drawing on Allan Moore’s concept of proxemics (2012) and Asaf Peres’s
    "sonic functions" (2016), I demonstrate that anti-telos choruses employ
    sonic techniques associated with closeness, such as removing reverb from
    the vocal line, omitting any accompaniment in the voice’s pitch range, and
    using a soft and quiet singing style. Second, anti-telos choruses open up
    space for other sections to act as a song’s energetic peak, thus
    threatening the chorus’s status as a climactic focal point. My discussion
    ultimately demonstrates how form is not just a basic template for song
    design but an inherently expressive feature of pop songs.</p>
