abstract: |
    <p>Following the 1812 premiere of Rossini&rsquo;s <em>Tancredi</em>, a Rossini fever swept Europe. This fever was subversive, emotionally rousing the masses in a time of anti-revolutionary political sentiment. Rossini&rsquo;s alluring music ensnared audiences, perhaps even endangering their health. Musical passages cited in accounts of this reception phenomenon frequently contain similar devices: irritating chromaticism, modal shifts from minor to major, bombastic orchestration, and repetitive stereotyped cadences.</p>
    <p>These four elements, along with their audience-rousing effects, are defining features of a musical schema I call the <em>felicit&agrave;</em> cadence. The <em>felicit&agrave;</em>, which ends most bel canto numbers, contains three repeated cadential phrases of increasingly shorter length. The initial, longer phrase, although the most flexible, routinely presents omnibus-like chromaticism and modal mixture before concluding with a rapturous &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; six-four close. Such musical contagions primed audiences for boisterous, joyous, and even infectious applause. Reception documents confirm that this schema excited audiences, namely by cueing applause, lending it to mockery by German-language critics who called it the <em>Bettelcadenz </em>(begging cadence). I explore the form and reception of this schema in examples by Bellini, Donizetti, Haydn, and Rossini.</p>
    <p>The <em>felicit&agrave;</em> cadence further suggests that musical schemata encompass aspects of music making beyond the perception of contrapuntal and formal patterns. In addition to purely musical elements, the <em>felicit&agrave;</em> encoded social behaviors (applause) and affect (delirious excitement). Its rich social content demands that schemata be understood as more than mere voice-leading formulas. Instead, schemata like the <em>felicit&agrave; </em>cadence serve an integral role in the fully social act of musicking.</p>
