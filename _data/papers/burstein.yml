    <p>Modern music theory tends to class all perfect authentic cadences (PACs) within the same basic category. Eighteenth-century theorists, on the other hand, treated PACs in a far more varied and nuanced manner, in a manner that has deep implications for analysis and performance. Accordingly, these theorists differentiated (1) PACs that might serve as the formal cadence (<em>förmliche Cadenz</em>) that could effectively conclude an entire movement; (2) PACs that could mark the formal cadence that ends a mid-movement <em>Periode</em> (a large, multi-phrase section); and (3) PACs that are better suited for the conclusion of a <em>Grundabsatz</em> (a mid-<em>Periode</em> resting point over a tonic harmony that does not establish a formal cadence). Adopting this more flexible attitude toward the PAC suggests various provocative interpretations—touching on both small-scale and large-scale matters—that diverge from what is typical of many modern approaches.</p>
