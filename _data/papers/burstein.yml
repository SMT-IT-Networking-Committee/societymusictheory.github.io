abstract: |
    <p>Is a V–VI deceptive cadence truly a “cadence”? Many argue that it is
    not, claiming that a V–VI motion merely delays the arrival of an ensuing
    authentic cadence. Yet even within pieces composed during the
    18th-century, some phrases do indeed conclude with a V–VI progression,
    with ramifications that deeply affect the work’s narrative structure. The
    concepts of Heinrich Christoph Koch provide avenues for thinking about
    these and other such unsettled phrase endings in a manner that is far more
    fluid than what is typical of modern theoretical approaches and in ways
    that can inform both analysis and performance.</p>
