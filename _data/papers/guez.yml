abstract: |
    <p>Umberto Eco once described the effects that accelerations and
    decelerations can have on a novel’s drama. By disrupting the work’s
    deep-level periodicity, he writes, such speed-changes mark “turning
    points” and “surprise developments.” This paper brings Eco’s insight about
    the dramatic function of rhythmic irregularities into the realm of music.
    I analyze two songs from Winterreise whose recapitulations are
    abbreviated, vis-à-vis their referential expositions, “Täuschung” and “Die
    Nebensonnen.” The recapitulatory accelerations help to project the songs’
    titular visual illusions. They “stage,” in music, the sense-deceptions
    that confront the cycle’s protagonist as he traverses his glaucous
    landscape.</p>
    <p>“Täuschung” describes a will-o’-the-wisp that lures the wanderer from his
    icy path. Müller’s poem features no stanzaic divisions but Schubert renders it
    musically in an ABA’ form whose reprise is five measures shorter than its
    exposition. Coupled with the Schubertian “score-as-landscape” metaphor, this
    deviation from the referential plan can be read as enacting, in music, the
    swerve performed (on the word “Täuschung”) by the winter-wanderer.</p>
    <p>In “Die Nebensonnen,” phantom suns illuminate the wanderer’s strophic song
    from two physical locations, casting different harmonic shadows. As the
    wanderer sarabandes through the multistellar space, there is a concomitant
    change of lighting. The recapitulatory acceleration registers a change in the
    objective conditions of the landscape. As the physical sun begins to set on
    the wanderer in this penultimate song, its flanking illusions draw inwards
    towards it, and the shadows they cast draw closer together until they overlap
    at the midpoint of the strophe.</p>
