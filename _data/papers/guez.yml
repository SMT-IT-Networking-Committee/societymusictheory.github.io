title: A Contribution to the Theory of Tonal Alterations in Sonata Recapitulations
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Despite differences in critical alignment, studies of sonata-like
    structures tend to share one feature in common: they devote the least amount
    of time to recapitulations. Two theoretical presuppositions may explain this
    neglect: (1) that the thematic layout of the recapitulation mirrors that of
    the exposition, and (2) that one obligatory tonal alteration is all that is
    needed to make a tonic-recapitulating sonata conclude in the key in which it
    began. The present paper uses examples from Schubert’s piano music to
    complexify the second of these in hopes of painting a more complete, and
    analytically adequate, picture of the ways tonal alterations are made in
    practice. Its goal is to reveal the wide range of strategies available to
    composers for enacting a sonata’s obligatory tonal adjustment.</p>

    <p>The central analytical section of the paper identifies six strategies
    for performing tonal alterations, each of which is suggestive of different
    narrative or dramatic situations. Moving from less to more “involved,” the
    strategies are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Alterations in silence</li>
      <li>Immediate alterations</li>
      <li>Thick alterations</li>
      <li>Multiple alterations</li>
      <li>Impotent alterations, and</li>
      <li>Self-effacing alterations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tonal alterations may be obligatory in sonatas with on-tonic
    recapitulations, but they are not for that reason deployed by composers
    <i>pro forma.</i> Indeed, Schubert (and others) composed tonal alterations
    in a range of sophisticated and dramatically appropriate ways. A detailed
    look at this understudied aspect of sonata composition enhances our
    music-analytic categories, sharpens our interpretive acumen, and invites
    us to hear recapitulations as sites of robust tonal dramas.</p>
