abstract: |
  <p>According to the Statistical Research Center, in 2012 there were over a
  thousand graduate students in musicology, but only seventy jobs posted that
  year for tenured, tenure-track, or permanent faculty positions. If we are to
  be realistic, the academic pipeline cannot be the salvation for graduate
  students of color, especially when underrepresented communities have rarely
  been prioritized in the market for traditional academic jobs. Instead,
  advising students of color means that the doctoral curriculum needs to be
  expanded. Many employment opportunities exist outside of the university.
  Unfortunately, musicology departments ranked dead last among humanities
  divisions in providing “occupationally oriented presentations by employers,
  employees, or alumni,” or “an internship in an employment setting” (by
  comparison, 98 percent of art history departments offered internships as part
  of their graduate programs). In twenty-first-century America, students of
  color require new ways of thinking about one’s work and one’s career. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I discuss one specific facet of the changing academic
  environment: the role of “applied” musicology in shaping scholarship and
  developing skills in academic and non-academic jobs. Applied musicology can be
  a framework and methodology for doctoral candidates to engage in rigorous
  research while also developing skills and knowledge that is widely applicable
  in other sectors and the “real world.” This paper draws on a collaboration
  between two musicologists of color. One teaches as an associate professor at a
  public university and entered the discipline in the 1990s during the first
  wave of “new musicology.” The other entered the job market in the wake of the
  financial instability of 2008 and now teaches and works in higher
  administration at a private university. Our discussion takes place among
  growing scholarship critically reflecting on the roles of the public
  intellectual and activist scholar, and our examination looks into quantitative
  data from sources such as the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> and the
  American Council of Learned Societies.</p>
