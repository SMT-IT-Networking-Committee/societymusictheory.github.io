abstract: |
    <p>As a percussion-heavy practice featuring polymeter and a multitude of complex rhythmic ostinati and improvisations, Afro-Colombian <em>currulao</em> lends itself well to music-theoretical study. This talk will explore some of those rhythmic patterns that feature extreme metrical dissonances beyond those considered in <em>Fantasy Pieces</em> (Krebs 1999). Not only does <em>currulao</em> feature both displacement and grouping dissonances simultaneously in its fundamental groove, but the polymeter involved between two of the metrical layers requires the introduction of a <em>pulse dissonance</em> model in order to account for the prevalence of contrasting pulses.</p>
    <p>The case study piece, “Adiós Guapi,” performed by Grupo Naidy in their album <em>Arriba Suena Marimba! (2006)</em>, contains rhythmic and metrical elements representative of <em>currulao</em>. This presentation will use existing metrical dissonance models and extensions to explain some of the piece’s rhythmic intricacies. I will demonstrate how the interlocking rhythmic elements are taught by some native musicians—a pedagogical perspective which encourages a polymetric interpretation of the practice. This paper will also consider how the contrasting pulses might be perceived by the musicians, listeners, and dancers.</p>
    <p>My hope for this contribution is not only to introduce underrepresented music to the scholarship, but also to suggest that the resulting newly expanded model might find applications across a much wider repertoire.</p>
