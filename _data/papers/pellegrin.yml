title: Chromatic-Third Relationships and Coltrane's Path to “Free” Jazz
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>This presentation complements existing biographical accounts of
    Coltrane’s career trajectory by investigating theoretical explanations for
    his stylistic development.  Methodological discussion demonstrates
    neo-Riemannian modeling of voicings rather than harmonies, and uncovers
    commonalities between reductive and transformational analytical approaches
    using the stable-norms/salient-deviations (SNSD) model (Pellegrin
    2016).</p>

    <p>Coltrane first used chromatic-third relationships during his
    vertical/change-running period to chromaticize simple tonal progressions
    and create greater harmonic density while improvising on jazz standards.
    These major-third cycles were ripe with implications that were logically
    realized in “Giant Steps” (GS), which pushes the limits of tonality and
    contains zero-sum voice-leading throughout.</p>

    <p>GS itself had implications which Coltrane then pursued during his modal
    period.  Unhappy with the ultra-clean sound of GS, Coltrane began
    superimposing major-third cycles over (implied) pedal points.  The freer
    dissonances created a harmonically-richer sound, but also pointed towards
    fully chromatic music.  In the late-period work “Venus,” Coltrane moves
    through chromatic-third progressions en route from diatonicism to free
    improvisation.  This represents a microcosm of Coltrane’s career overall,
    evidencing the premise that for him chromatic-third relationships function
    as an intermediary—both historical and theoretical—between tonality and
    “atonality.”</p>

    <p>This hypothesis is bolstered by drawing a parallel with the function of
    chromatic-third relationships in the development of Western classical
    music.  For example, the fact that Coltrane’s chromatic-third cycles led
    him to compose GS, arguably a non-tonal work, recalls Cohn’s (1997)
    proposition that the parsimonious voice-leading properties inherent in—and
    specific to—the triad were “fortuitous” for the development of tonality,
    yet themselves also led to the “destruction” of tonality.</p>
