    <p>The Adagio in G minor by Tomaso Albinoni is one of the most enduringly popular baroque compositions in the repertory. It appears regularly on anthology discs with titles like <em>Baroque Masterpieces</em> and <em>Essential Baroque</em>, and has become so ubiquitous in cinema that critic Anthony Lane recently suggested that the piece be “banned onscreen.” Yet, culturally omnipresent though it remains, this most famous of Albinoni’s compositions is not, in fact, by Albinoni at all. As the Saxon State Library clarified decades ago, the piece is a twentieth-century “forgery”—i.e., a newly composed work deliberately misattributed to a figure from the historical past.</p>
    <p>Music theory has no established vocabulary for addressing such pieces on their own terms. In a pioneering study of Albinoni, Michael Talbot (1990) understandably adopts the usual approach, dismissing the Adagio in G minor as a composition whose style is “so totally unlike Albinoni’s that it invites us to explore his music under false premises.” This paper takes the opposite tack, asking what can be learned about postmodern classical-music culture by subjecting an exposed fake to in-depth analysis. Philosophical and art-historical writing on forgery suggests that works such as this often succeed, in Max Friedländer’s words (1942), because “the forger has understood, and misunderstood, the old master in the same way as ourselves.” It is in this vein, I argue, that the Adagio’s montage of archaic descending tetrachord patterns and abrupt chromatic modulations has rich meaning as a document not of the eighteenth century, but of the twentieth. </p>
