title: "Harmonic Syntax in the Canzonas of Frescobaldi"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Frescobaldi’s canzonas reflect the rapidly evolving harmonic language
    of the early 17th century and prefigure the formal and textural
    characteristics of the mid 17th-century instrumental sonata. My paper
    explores Frescobaldi’s harmonic style in 44 three- and four-part canzonas,
    all published during the composer’s lifetime (<i>Canzoni</i> (1608), <i>Il
    primo libro delle canzoni</i> (1628–35), <i>Canzoni da sonare</i> (1634),
    <i>Fiori musicali</i> (1635), <i>Canzoni franzese</i> (1642)).</p>
    <p>Harmonic syntax is important in defining musical style, but it is
    poorly understood in 17th-century music. Previous studies of tonality at
    the beginning (Powers 1981, 1992, 1998) and end (Barnett 1998, 2002, 2008,
    2010) of the 17th century do not address harmonic syntax. I argue that
    Frescobaldi’s canzonas are an important link between the Renaissance and
    the Baroque, laying the groundwork for common-practice harmony and helping
    to establish tonalities that appear in the works of later 17th-century
    composers. I demonstrate that while some of Frescobaldi’s tonalities have
    a sound of their own, others are highly similar, both in terms of chord
    histograms (tallies of occurrence) and chord progressions (modeled as
    Markov chains), forecasting the transpositional relationship between
    18th-century keys.</p>
