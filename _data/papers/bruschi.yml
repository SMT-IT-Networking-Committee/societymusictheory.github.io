    <p>Much scholarship on the funk groove centers on the concept of “the ‘One,’” which Anne Danielsen (quoting James Brown) memorably characterizes as a “downbeat, in anticipation.” But what exactly does this downbeat anticipate? I posit a commonsense answer—beat two. I propose a reframing of scholarly attention from “the ‘One’” to “the ‘Two’” on two interrelated grounds: (1) the onset of beat two, as a jumping-off point for the complexities of the groove texture, acts as arguably the strongest “attentional peak” (London 2004) in a typical funk groove; and because of this, (2) it can be characterized as the unique location within the measure that is vectored most palpably in a single direction. This is to say, if “the ‘One’” is somehow both downbeat and anticipation, gesturing simultaneously onwards and backwards, then “the ‘Two’” often gestures distinctively and unambiguously in just one direction—forwards. My notion of “the ‘Two’” as “jumping-off point” combines insights from Nicole Biamonte and Yonatan Malin in conceiving of beat two as a “higher-level displacement consonance.” This fuses Biamonte’s idea of the drum backbeat as “displacement consonance” with Malin’s remarks about the emergence of independent metric hierarchies in the face of sustained displacement dissonances. I frame the consonance of “the ‘Two’” in expectational terms: this is the juncture where one’s expectation of impending syncopation and cross-rhythm rises to a local maximum. I then discuss some musical examples in which the forward-directed impulse imparted by “the ‘Two’” is most clearly on display.</p>
