    <p>From the fourteenth to the twentieth centuries, Ottoman music theory was recorded in individual treatises, known as <em>edvar</em>. One such treatise, by Dimitrie Cantemir (1673–1723), describes the Turkish <em>makam</em> system in a remarkable amount of detail compared to the others that preceded it. Cantemir was a Moldavian prince who lived in Constantinople as part of a diplomatic arrangement. There, for twenty years, he received courtly education in music and became a renowned composer, theorist, and performer. Cantemir’s theory is a reflection of his Ottoman education, which was at the time based on the relationship of individual pitches to one another within a foundational gamut of seventeen primary notes spanning roughly two octaves. This historical approach presents a radically different understanding of the <em>makam</em> system from the predominant twentieth-century theory that builds scales out of microtonal tetrachords and pentachords. Avoiding tetrachordal paradigms altogether, Cantemir describes how each pitch could form the focal point of a melody using the notes of the gamut. In this understanding, a <em>makam</em> is defined as any melody that begins and ends on one of these pitches. In addition to aiding in analysis, this approach illuminates the otherwise enigmatic naming system of <em>makam</em>; the mode <em>Çargah</em>, for instance, is so called because that is the name of its pitch in the gamut. Using this pitch-centered understanding, I will present a new methodology for <em>makam</em> analysis based on historical sources as well as make accessible the music-theoretical perspectives found in the writings of non-Western theorists like Cantemir.</p>
