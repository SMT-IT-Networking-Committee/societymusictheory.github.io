abstract: |
    <p>I had just returned to the United States from Turkey after only one year there amid the aftermath of a failed military coup in 2016. Many of my colleagues were jailed and my university was taken over by the government. As a scholar of Turkish and Puerto Rican descent, I felt connected to Turkey so much so that I took a position at a university in Ankara. Immediately upon my return to the U.S. came the election and subsequent “Muslim ban.” While Turkey was not on the list of prohibited countries, I was attempting to bring my then-fiancée and anti-immigrant rhetoric was heating up. After two years of struggle with USCIS, we got married and now have a child. I eventually landed on my feet as an adjunct faculty at my current institution. However, being contingent faculty means struggling below the poverty level and without benefits. The difficulties of my full teaching load and working several jobs are prohibitive to maintaining a robust research program. Furthermore, as someone who studies both Western and Turkish music, it is the Turkish music that draws microaggressions in interviews, such as “It must be difficult to find instruments for an ensemble,” or, “What is the audience for scholarship on that music?” This presentation uncovers the inequities that I have encountered within academia involving race/ethnicity and contingent faculty status.</p>
