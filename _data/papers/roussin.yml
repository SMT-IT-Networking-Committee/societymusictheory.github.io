abstract: |
  <p>Joseph Haydn’s final oratorio, <i>The Seasons</i> (1801), has consistently
  been neglected in performance and scholarship, particularly when compared to
  its earlier, more successful counterpart, <i>The Creation</i> (1798). A number
  of factors contribute to this neglect, central among them the belief that
  <i>The Seasons</i> lacked the musical innovation of Haydn’s setting of the
  Christian creation story, a thought that would gain further momentum as
  aesthetic and musical tastes changed throughout the nineteenth century. Yet
  Haydn’s final oratorio is a work of remarkable musical artistry and insight,
  especially when considered in the context of the eighteenth-century culture of
  sensibility and the rise of sentimental opera. While Jessica Waldoff and James
  Webster have both stressed the necessity of examining the presence of
  sentiment and sensibility in Haydn’s oeuvre, no study has yet considered how
  both might be at work in Haydn’s oratorios. </p>
  <p>History has primarily remembered Haydn as a composer of symphonies and
  string quartets, overlooking that he was also a prolific composer and
  conductor of opera from 1762 to 1790 while in the service of the Esterházy
  family. Haydn’s work in opera composition and production ensures that he would
  have been intimately aware of the conventions of sentimental opera,
  particularly the sentimental heroine—something which could certainly have
  implications regarding musical characterization in his oratorios. By examining
  the ways in which Hanne, one of the three central characters in <i>The
  Seasons</i>, is constructed as sentimental in van Swieten’s libretto and
  Haydn’s score, I demonstrate how the librettist and composer at once reinforce
  and recast the trope of the sentimental heroine. Textually and musically,
  Hanne features many of the expected qualities, including an emphasis on virtue
  and constancy, heightened sensitivity, and sentimental singing style. Yet van
  Swieten and Haydn also endow Hanne with a level of agency that departs from
  the traditionally passive figure. Ultimately, in his final major
  musico-dramatic work, Haydn experiments with one of the central operatic
  tropes of the eighteenth century. By being aware of these particular features,
  music scholarship might arrive at a renewed appreciation not only of <i>The
  Seasons</i>, but also of Haydn’s abilities as a musical dramatist. </p>
