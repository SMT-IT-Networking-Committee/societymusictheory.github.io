abstract: |
    <p>18th-century Germanophone music theory coined the term <i>chorda
    elegantiora </i>(“elegant tone”) to categorize scale degrees that are
    chromatic inflections of their diatonic forms, not something borrowed from
    another key (Mattheson 1719; Walther 1732; Kellner 1737). #4 is principal
    among these “elegant tones”: already in 1728, Johann Heinichen used the phrase
    <i>bizarrer Satz</i> (“fantastical progression”) to describe a remarkable but
    nonetheless common occurrence, where a diminished seventh-chord (DIM7) is used
    to modulate by placing it on #4 of the desired key. Discussions of the DIM7 on
    #4 and instructions to modulate freely via this “fantastical progression”
    appear copiously throughout the long 18th century.</p>

    <p>By drawing on historical, corpus-analytic, and creative methodologies,
    my paper argues that the #ivo7 indicates an extended conception of key in the
    18th century, one that carries not only analytic and hermeneutic but also
    practical implications: specifically, the concept of #ivo7 represents the
    entire problem of 18th-century modulation, when framed as a pragmatic
    improvisational and compositional question—how to modulate convincingly and
    with expression.</p>

    <p>Historical instructions and analyses, alongside hundreds of basses from
    C.P.E Bach’s <i>Versuch </i>and Albrechtsberger’s exhaustive study of
    modulation (1793–1806), reveal a highly-codified practice of DIM7 usage in
    the 18th century, whereby the chord’s syntactic behaviors are inherited
    from historical bass-line schemata. This allows for multiple levels of
    harmonic-functional <i>Mehrdeutigkeit </i>(Weber 1832) and wide-reaching
    tonal explorations, which found their deepest expression in the fantasia
    genre, here reflected practically in my own late-Classical-style fantasia
    for fortepiano, as a form of arts-based research.</p>
