    <p>The international “new theory” (Sanguinetti 2014) formed of schemata
    and partimenti has painted a powerful picture of musical creativity in the
    long 18th century, one centered on the close imitation of models. The
    Neapolitan conservatories and Italian diaspora have placed partimento
    schooling especially center stage. The coherence of this picture, however,
    owes to generalizations about the whole (creativity) from a particular
    (craft-training). My paper problematizes 18th-century musical creativity
    by positioning Beethoven, as composer and metaphor for a German tradition,
    in counterpoint with the world of partimento in two interrelated ways: one
    aesthetic-philosophical, the other practical.</p>
    <p>The creative mechanism advanced by the “new theory” is foreign to the
    musical aesthetics and values into which Beethoven was born: the creative
    process has been described in terms of “automatic composition”
    (Sanguinetti 2012), “transcription” (Gjerdingen 2007), and “memes going
    viral” (Gjerdingen and Bourne 2015). Meanwhile, Beethoven’s earliest
    training with Christian Gottlob Neefe in Bonn is reflected in Johann Georg
    Sulzer’s <i>Allgemeine Theorie</i> (1771–74). Its creative and aesthetic
    categories, which include “originality,” “invention,” and “variety” in
    “unity,” are values that Neefe (1783, 1785) “put in [Beethoven’s] hands”
    at a young age, along with <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>.</p>
    <p>Drawing on the “historical imagination” (Treitler 1989), I creatively
    imagine how Beethoven might have implemented Sulzer’s aesthetic categories
    in a realization of Bach’s partimento-fantasia from BWV 908, and how this
    differs from modern partimento-trained solutions and the first published
    realization by Carl Czerny (1839). Differences among these realizations
    throw dichotomies within 18th-century musical thought into sharp
    relief.</p>
