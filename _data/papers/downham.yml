handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>George Russell’s <i>Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization</i>—the
  most influential theoretical treatise authored by an African American
  musician—established a universe of tonal possibilities for composers and
  improvisers to explore. Russell, an iconoclastic autodidact, advanced his
  theory in part as a reaction to “oppressive” Western music theories and their
  concomitant ethics for how music ought to be composed, improvised, or listened
  to. Rejecting prescriptive music theories, Russell’s <i>Concept</i> offers
  instead a generative vocabulary for musicians to draw from and thereby develop
  their own musical systems. Since it refuses to promulgate a musical syntax,
  the <i>Concept</i> provides musicians with a theoretical infrastructure for
  relating seemingly disparate musical styles and integrating them in innovative
  ways. In effect, networks of practicing musicians collectively build upon
  previous styles through the <i>Concept</i> in order to furnish idiosyncratic
  musical dialects that may transgress Western musical ethics. </p>
  <p>Eric Dolphy, multi-instrumentalist, composer, and improviser, writes to
  Russell in 1961, “Trying to play the new concept with an outward bound
  feeling.” Dolphy’s omnivorous musical interests and voracious practice habits
  lead to him to realize a musical idiolect with virtuosic command that drew
  from twentieth-century Western modernists, Western classical icons, “world
  musics,” Charles Christopher Parker, Thelonious Sphere Monk, Art Tatum, bird
  songs, and urban sounds. For example, Dolphy synthesized Monk’s system of
  tritone substitutions and Stravinsky’s polytonal techniques in his polytonal
  blues composition “Les,” as well as in his flute solo on “April Fool.”
  Further, Dolphy’s polymodal compositional and improvisational methods (e.g.,
  in “Gazzelloni”) reflect atonal and dodecaphonic strategies of aggregate
  circulation and hexachordal combinatoriality. Dolphy and his music thus
  provide a rich case study of how Russell’s experimentalist and integrationist
  music theory can be applied. Deeper inquiry into Dolphy’s music can elucidate
  our understanding of John Coltrane’s musical legacy, the technique of playing
  outside, and the ways in which avant-garde musicians negotiated “musical
  freedom.” In this presentation, I demonstrate—based on my archival research
  with the Eric Dolphy Collection housed in the Library of Congress—how Dolphy
  extended and transformed knowledge embedded in jazz practice and diverse
  stylistic influences through the theoretical conduit of Russell’s
  <i>Concept</i>. </p>
