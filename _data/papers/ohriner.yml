title: (Why) Does Talib Kweli Rhyme Off-Beat?
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Phonology and music theory address rhythm in starkly different terms.
    While both accounts treat rhythm hierarchically, authors generally agree
    that music’s durations are periodic and speech’s durations are not.
    Because they address distinct domains, these accounts can remain both
    incompatible and useful within their scope. Yet this separation is
    untenable for the rapping voice, which must be comprehensible as speech
    and musically compelling. A rapper whose durations stray too far from
    periodic organization hazards accusations of rapping “off-beat.” The emcee
    Talib Kweli’s work has long attracted such accusations; this presentation
    contextualizes those critiques by examining his rhythm with greater
    precision, documenting specific practices (e.g., phase shift and swing)
    emblematic of musical rhythm and the exploring the limits of those
    practices in his output.</p>

    <p>Addressing the title’s question, I compute the non-alignment between a
    phrase of rapping and its metric structure. Further, I characterize the
    extent to which Afro-diasporic practices of phase shifting and swing
    explain that non-alignment. I then define “off-beat” rapping as delivery
    with non-alignment not attributable to these practices. Documenting both
    on- and off-beat rapping in Kweli, I propose that he rhymes off-beat to
    diversify the rhythmic surface and affiliate with hip-hop’s aesthetic
    priority of rupture. Beyond rap delivery, these syllabic
    displacements—erased in conventional music notation—pervade sung
    performances in other genres as well. Therefore, gradating “off-beat” and
    “on-beat” delivery could enhance analyses of rhythm in other spoken or
    sung musical performances, for speech and song are not so easily
    distinguished rhythmically.</p>
