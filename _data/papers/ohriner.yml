    <p>This presentation reframes the concept of groove in the rapping voice
    and introduces the concept of the groove class. Following Cohn’s
    “Platonic” funky rhythms, a groove, in my construal, is an idealized,
    repeating combination of inter-accent durations, restricted to two or
    three 16th-notes, that sum to one measure. Further, I introduce an
    algorithmic segmenter that partitions a rapped verse into groove
    sequences. This algorithm selects from all viable grooves at a given
    moment, prioritizing those that are longer and more conformant to the
    sounding accentual pattern.</p>
    <p>These grooves differ in metric complexity, a summation of the metric
    “weakness” of those positions within the meter that carry accent. In three
    analyses, I demonstrate Eminem’s use of this variable metric complexity,
    showing how trajectories of metric complexity mirror narratives within his
    lyrics both within and between verses in a track. This construal of groove
    and the algorithmic segmentation method has potential for theorists of
    rhythm in other groove-based musics. More so, the analyses in this
    presentation form a bridge between approaches to analyzing rap from the
    perspectives of musical rhythm and poetry. While these approaches have
    much to offer each other, as yet they rarely intersect.</p>
