    <p>Although identifying a song’s primary pulse rate, more commonly called the beat, is a fundamental musical skill, it has generated varied theories and analyses throughout history and across disciplines. Popular music has been a rewarding repertoire to which to apply and refine traditional approaches as well as to develop new, style-specific theories. Rather than adopting any single definition, this presentation introduces a three-part conception of beat for popular music analysis which better characterizes the temporal phenomenon’s multi-dimensional, interactive, and interpretive attributes. The first half of the presentation outlines the three facets of beat, each identifying a song’s primary pulse rate according to a different musical parameter. The drum pattern rate (DPR) prioritizes the drumset rhythm, aligning with the bass-snare alternation or the four-on-the-floor bass drum rhythm. The absolute time rate (ATR) privileges a prescribed tempo, identifying the layer closest to 120 beats-per-minute. And the preferred pulse rate (PPR) models listener preferences, allowing individuals to treat any pulse rate as primary. The second half of the presentation shifts to analytical application. For example, while it is common for the DPR, ATR, and PPR to identify the same pulse rate as primary, there are at least three types of musical passages that show the more dynamic and varied ways these distinct conceptions can interact: different tempi, changing grooves, and ambiguity. </p>
