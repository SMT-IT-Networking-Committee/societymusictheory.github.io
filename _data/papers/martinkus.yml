    <p>Form-functional displacement in Schubert’s sonata forms results from two complementary musical processes. The first, a “developmental” or “dramatic” episode, occurs when tonal and formal processes more typically associated with development sections—e.g., “core technique” comprising model-sequence, fragmentation, foreshortening, and thematic liquidation—in expositions or recapitulations. The second situation can be seen as the inverse: it comprises development sections that are “un-developmental” in their construction. Here we find thematic material treated as we might expect in expositions or recapitulations; in Schubert’s idiom, this means processes of variation come to the fore. Such “variational” development sections have received comparatively little analytical attention, yet they are as important as developmental episodes in understanding the multifaceted role of functional displacement in Schubert’s idiom.</p>
    <p>My analyses of D. 887/i, D. 958/i, D. 959/i, and D. 960/i illustrate developmental episodes and variational developments. For example, in D. 959/i the subordinate theme complex exemplifies core technique through the deployment of formal loosening devices, suggesting the beginning of the development section. Conversely, the development section is organized as a series of variations. Through an interrogation of form-functional displacement, this paper begins to address the rift between theory and Schubert’s compositional practice. In my conclusion, I consider an alternative lens—that of formal expansion—to frame this phenomenon. Ultimately, the expanded proportions in Schubert’s sonata forms problematize facile distinctions between interthematic functions, and require a reconfiguring of expectations surrounding the compositional possibilities available within a sonata form.</p>
