title: "Repetition as Expansion: Large-Scale Sentential Structures in Franz Schubert’s Subordinate Themes"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Scholars of form-functional theory have long been interested in the
  organization of subordinate theme groups in classical and romantic sonata
  forms (Caplin 1987, 1991, 1998; Schmalfeldt 1992, 2011; Vande Moortele 2016).
  Despite this, close readings of Franz Schubert’s subordinate themes are rare.
  I analyze Schubert’s first-movement sonata forms, focusing on processes of
  structural expansion in three subordinate themes: the C Major Symphony (D.
  944), the C Major String Quintet (D. 956), and the C Minor Piano Sonata (D.
  958). These works exemplify a broader trend in Schubert’s oeuvre: in each,
  repetition functions intrathematically, participating in processes of
  structural expansion within the framework of an overarching, large-scale
  sentential design.</p>
  <p>Following the work of BaileyShea (2002/2003) and Vande Moortele (2011), I
  abstract an underlying template of sentential phrase construction, tight-knit
  + tight-knit + loose, to describe relationships between thematic restatements
  in sentential structures. I consider the first iteration of a theme or phrase
  and its repetition as tight-knit, forming a large-scale presentation, while
  the following loose section typically exhibits characteristics of continuation
  function and (often) leads to a PAC. The treatment of repetition in D. 944, D.
  958, and D. 956 momentarily delays the perception of a unit’s formal function;
  however, the third thematic statement—initiating processes of retrospective
  reinterpretation—brings into focus the overarching structure of these expanded
  subordinate themes and makes clear the role of repetition in their formal
  construction. As such, Schubert’s sentential designs demonstrate the subsuming
  of seemingly paratactic structures into the hypotactic discourse of sonata
  form.</p>
