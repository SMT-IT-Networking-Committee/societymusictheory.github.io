        <p>Caitlin Martinkus is a Collegiate Assistant Professor of Music Theory at Virginia Tech. Her research interests include the music of Franz Schubert, musical form in the nineteenth century, historical and contemporaneous theories of musical form, and nineteenth-century improvisatory practices. She has presented research on these subjects at the annual meeting of the Society for Music Theory, the European Music Analysis Conference, Music Theory Mid-Atlantic, and Music Theory Midwest.</p>
        <p>Caitlin completed her PhD in Music Theory at the University of Toronto in 2017. Her dissertation, “The Urge to Vary: Schubert’s Variation Practice from Schubertiades to Sonata Forms,” reveals the many and nuanced ways in which elements of variation permeate Schubert’s idiom. Her most recent publication in <em>Music Theory &amp; Analysis</em> considers Schubert’s use of variation techniques in the introduction and subordinate theme complex of the C Major Symphony (D. 944/i).</p>
        <p>Caitlin is an affiliate of the Centre for the Study of Nineteenth-Century Music at the University of Toronto. Her research has been supported by Virginia Tech (Provost Mentoring Grant) and the Ontario provincial government (OGS).</p>

abstract: |
    <p>Form-functional displacement in Schubert’s sonata forms results from two complementary musical processes. The first, a “developmental” or “dramatic” episode, occurs when tonal and formal processes more typically associated with development sections—e.g., “core technique” comprising model-sequence, fragmentation, foreshortening, and thematic liquidation—in expositions or recapitulations. The second situation can be seen as the inverse: it comprises development sections that are “un-developmental” in their construction. Here we find thematic material treated as we might expect in expositions or recapitulations; in Schubert’s idiom, this means processes of variation come to the fore. Such “variational” development sections have received comparatively little analytical attention, yet they are as important as developmental episodes in understanding the multifaceted role of functional displacement in Schubert’s idiom.</p>
    <p>My analyses of D. 887/i, D. 958/i, D. 959/i, and D. 960/i illustrate developmental episodes and variational developments. For example, in D. 959/i the subordinate theme complex exemplifies core technique through the deployment of formal loosening devices, suggesting the beginning of the development section. Conversely, the development section is organized as a series of variations. Through an interrogation of form-functional displacement, this paper begins to address the rift between theory and Schubert’s compositional practice. In my conclusion, I consider an alternative lens—that of formal expansion—to frame this phenomenon. Ultimately, the expanded proportions in Schubert’s sonata forms problematize facile distinctions between interthematic functions, and require a reconfiguring of expectations surrounding the compositional possibilities available within a sonata form.</p>
