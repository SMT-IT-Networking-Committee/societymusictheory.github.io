handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>In many virtual reality (VR) experiences, the identity inhabited by the
    user is at least as if not more important than the gameplay itself. For
    example, the VR game <i>Electronauts</i> (Survios 2018) invites its user
    to take on the persona of a futuristic space-DJ. However, a cursory foray
    into the game quickly reveals its myriad constraints, which exercise a
    significant influence over what music a user can create. And yet player
    reviews seem to suggest a lack of awareness regarding these limits.
    Indeed, users take full ownership over the music created using
    <i>Electronauts</i>, claiming the game makes them feel like “a real
    DJ.”<i> Electronauts</i> facilitates this identification with the DJ
    persona by building DJ aesthetic practices (largely theorized by Mark
    Butler (2014) and Yara Sellin (2005)) into the interface itself.</p>
    <p>I argue that VR technology opens up new avenues of user engagement by
    providing a hyper-immersive experience of identification, moving beyond
    virtual performance to the construction of a virtual creative identity.
    Rather than the music working to support a visual medium, as is common in
    film or video games, <i>Electronauts</i> exhibits how music can in a sense
    be the medium, facilitating the embodied experience of identification. By
    providing the experience of truly “feeling like a DJ,” <i>Electronauts</i>
    invites its users to take ownership of the music created within the
    game—as one user states: “if you like music, and REALLY wanna feel like a
    DJ or Daft Punk on bloody C R A C K download this.”</p>
