abstract: |
    <p>Brahms’s songs “Schwermut” (op. 58, no. 5), “Dämmrung senkte sich von
    oben” (op. 59, no. 1), and “Todessehnen” (op. 86, no. 6) use
    minor-to-major progressions to portray poetic oppositions between earthly
    struggle and transcendent death, as well as temporalities that are latent
    in the poem. A cadential six-four chord (Robert Hatten’s “arrival six-four
    chord”; 1994) at the structural cadence in each song confirms the major
    mode and depicts achieved future transcendence. In preparing the emergent
    major tonic, each song prolongs VI or IV, dramatizing the transformation
    of scale degrees 3 and 6 into their major-mode counterparts as the
    protagonist envisions the future.</p>

    <p>This claim extends studies by Heather Platt (1992) and Lauri Suurpää
    (2001), which explore how Brahms’s songs that imply transcendent death
    progress from a minor key to a cadential six-four chord in the parallel
    major. Platt and Suurpää show that “Mit vierzig Jahren” (op. 94, no. 1)
    prolongs a Neapolitan harmony, while “Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer”
    (op. 105, no. 2) uses a chromaticized I<sup>5−6</sup>  As I will show,
    “Schwermut” prolongs C-flat major (VI) to portray present melancholy
    (E-flat minor) yielding to desired future catharsis (E-flat major), while
    “Dämmrung senkte sich von oben” passes through prolongations of E-flat
    major (VI) and C major (IV) as the moon—a symbol of future
    enlightenment—transforms darkness (G minor) into light (G major).
    “Todessehnen” prolongs D minor (VI) to convey the transformative catalyst
    of Christ’s love, which enables the protagonist’s escape from earthly
    burdens (F-sharp minor) into transcendent death (F-sharp major).</p>
