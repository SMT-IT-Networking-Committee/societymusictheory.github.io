  <p>Unlike other aspects of musical content—such as harmony, form, melody, and
  rhythm, for which scholars have developed sophisticated analytic
  systems—approaches to vocal delivery remain underdeveloped, due in part to the
  complexity and multi-dimensionality of singing voices. For scholars analyzing
  musical content of popular music, this analytic void becomes even more
  problematic when one considers that vocal content tends to influence the
  meanings listeners ascribe to pop music recordings, perhaps more so than other
  musical parameters. Existing approaches to voice offer insights focused on
  individual aspects of vocal delivery, but we lack a comprehensive method for
  interpreting vocal delivery that incorporates all of the variable parameters
  that come together to create each unique voice. </p>
  <p>To this end, I propose a conceptual model for analyzing vocal delivery in
  popular song recordings focused on three overlapping areas of inquiry—pitch,
  prosody, and quality—and I apply ideas from the conceptual model to analyses
  of Elliott Smith songs covered by Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield (2015):
  “Between the Bars,” “Twilight,” and “Roman Candle.” For some songs recorded
  by artists whose voices connote a particular brand of longing or
  desperation, the same quality of emotion becomes impossible to convey
  through other singing voices, suggesting that the quality of emotion is
  inextricably linked to the alterity of the singing voice. Furthermore, the
  connection between quality of singing voices and quality of emotion informs
  listeners’ constructions of authenticity in popular music.</p>
