title: The Shape and Structure of Musical Contour Space
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Musical contour remains an active topic in music analysis,
    ethnomusicology, music cognition, and composition. Different strains of
    contour theory have employed various formulations and tools to categorize and
    measure contour. Contour is succinctly described as the sequence of ups and
    downs, or changes in direction rather than the magnitude of those changes, in
    some musical feature: melody, rhythm, or even sound spectra, from the shortest
    gesture to larger forms.</p>

    <p>Our work examines the structure of contour space, using new
    mathematical and computational tools. We refigure contour as a <i>quotient
    space</i>, introducing a general definition of contour as <i>equivalence
    class</i> on the space of possible contours. This representation unifies
    various contour representations, presents a generalized mathematical
    model, and suggests new tools for understanding contour.</p>

    <p>We develop a geometric interpretation of contour space and its
    enumeration that reveals combinatorial contour as a highly structured
    lower-dimensional subspace of<i> linear contour</i> space. Through a
    change-of-basis, we construct a coordinate system specific to
    combinatorial contour, which allows us to work directly with and only with
    combinatorial contours. Continuing, we offer a comparative analysis of
    existing contour definitions by representing them as quotient spaces, and
    we examine their relation to other mathematical measures. We find that
    most contour metrics (Morris’ and Marvin and LaPrade’s CSIM, Quinn’s
    C+SIM, Polansky’s OCD) correlate closely to cosine (angular) distance.
    This leads to a formulation of contour in terms of polar coordinates,
    where angle expresses difference in shape and magnitude difference in
    scale, creating a theory that unifies magnitude and contour.</p>
