    <p>This paper offers a narrative account of Darius Milhaud’s cantata <i>Le
    Château du feu</i> and draws from the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gilles
    Deleuze, and Lawrence Kramer in order to critique the epistemological relation
    of description to music’s ontologies. The Lacanian notion that knowledge is
    mediated by language hearkens to Nietzsche, and fortifies Kramer’s assertion
    that “there is no such thing as music”—or, no such transcendental category.
    Instead, music emerges as a perceptual category as subjects <i>circumnavigate
    </i>their experiences with all kinds of description. Deleuze’s
    <i>Bergsonism</i> deconstructs the temporal distinction between past and
    present, asserting that consciousness emerges through the hermeneutic process
    of <i>actualization</i>, in which the subject recovers a recollection from the
    ontological past and re-perceives it in the psychological present. Through
    actualization, the descriptive associations that subjects ascribe to music
    determine the epistemological form of its knowable ontologies: music is the
    aggregate of its descriptions. In other words, where there is music, there is
    hermeneutics.</p>

    <p>By invoking memories of Holocaust violence, the ontologies of Milhaud’s
    cantata reach beyond score and performance to encompass the re-perception
    of recalled atrocities. The cantata’s repeated, ascending glissando motive
    springs to life as the ferrous rasp of a death-camp crematorium door,
    while canons separated by semitone revive the weeping of bereaved
    mothers. <i>Le Château du feu</i> is a ritual of re-perception through
    which victims’ voices gain embodiment to speak once again, yielding
    meanings that are ontologically indissociable from “the music itself.”</p>
