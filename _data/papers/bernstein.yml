  <p>Neither the contextual logic of serial transformations nor the formalist
  discourse surrounding serial music suggest that serialism is a profitable
  foundation for text-music relations. But in five of his early serial vocal
  works—“The Widow’s Lament in Springtime,” <i>Du</i>, <i>Two Sonnets</i>,
  <i>Vision and Prayer</i>, and <i>Philomel</i>—Babbitt uses a variety of means
  to project both poetic form and the psychological life of the characters
  represented. This paper will sketch some of these techniques, arguing that
  text-music relations (and musical meaning generally) should not be neglected
  in serial analysis.</p>
  <p>The predominant serial technique of Babbitt’s early years is trichordal
  derivation. Derivation can model metaphors of reference, dependency, and
  layers of psychological action, as well as types of poetic register (e.g.,
  narrative or lyrical). “The Widow’s Lament,” <i>Du</i>, and <i>Philomel</i>
  all make substantial use of these resources—the first two using trichordal
  derivation, the latter using a transpositional displacement scheme. Divergence
  between voice and accompaniment can also create layers of agency and
  implication. <i>Du</i> and <i>Philomel</i> both provide striking examples, in
  which the accompaniment provides signals as to how the voice and text develop.
  Moreover, in all five of these pieces, poetic form is projected through the
  coordination of serial and poetic articulation. Most elaborately, each
  component of the Petrarchan end-rhyme scheme in <i>Two Sonnets</i> corresponds
  to a different type of serial structure.</p>
  <p>Text-music relations in these five works demonstrate some of serialism’s
  oft-neglected metaphorical potential. Examination of these works thus has
  implications for serial analysis of both vocal and instrumental music.</p>
