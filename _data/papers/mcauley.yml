title: "Orgasmic Rapture and Devotional Bliss: Schopenhauer on Music and Sex"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>At the close of his discussion of music in Volume II of <i>Die Welt als
  Wille und Vorstellung</i> (1848), Arthur Schopenhauer equates music with
  ānanda, a Sanskrit term traditionally translated as “blissfulness,” but which
  refers specifically to devotional bliss, to orgasmic rapture, and to the
  connection between these experiences. Taking this puzzling passage as its
  starting point, the first part of this paper attempts to reread Schopenhauer’s
  philosophy of music from the perspective of his philosophy of sex. So doing
  illuminates the philosopher’s concept of “will”—a blind, destructive striving
  that remains opaque when reading Schopenhauer’s philosophy of music outside of
  its wider context. This, in turn, leads me to argue that Schopenhauer’s
  philosophy of music is not primarily metaphysical, as it is almost universally
  painted in the literature, but rather metaethical.</p>
  <p>In the second part of the paper, I argue that just as Schopenhauer’s
  remarks on sex can cast light on his philosophy of music, so too can music
  suggest a new reading of Schopenhauer’s philosophy of sex—and, by extension,
  of the will itself. Schopenhauer’s general view of sex is darkly pessimistic:
    sexual desire, on his view, causes nothing but suffering, and the only
  reasonable response is chastity. Yet Schopenhauer cannot escape his
  intoxication with music, which, by showing the pleasures of satisfaction,
  shows the pleasures of willing, and leads him, in his discussion of music, to
  describe ānanda as the highest Ātman: the truest self. In so doing,
  Schopenhauer offers a uniquely positive—for him—assessment of human
  sexuality.</p>
