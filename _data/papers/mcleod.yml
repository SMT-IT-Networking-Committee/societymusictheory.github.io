  <p>Music, and the world in general, is increasingly a hybridized mixed-reality
  experience, a complex blend of the physically “real” and the digital.
  Centering on the holographic opera <i>The End</i>, this paper discusses
  anxieties surrounding the incursion of technology in human operatic
  performance and its growing role in generating spiritual experiences.</p>
  <p>Hatsune Miku is a synthetically voiced virtual Japanese pop idol who
  performs “live” as a holographic projection. Miku is featured in <i>The
  End</i> (2013), the world’s first holographic opera. Composed by Shibuya and
  Okada, this multi-media work, which has received numerous international
  performances, employs no human singers. Reflecting on the metaphysics of the
  hologram phenomenon, it questions the meaning of life and death as the
  (seemingly) artificial Miku becomes aware of her potential mortality, asking
  the question “Will I die?” Miku subsequently undergoes different travails in
  which she appears to die in various ways. The opera “ends” where it began,
  with Miku questioning whether or not she will, or even can, die. Ironically,
  it is through the virtual holographic/machinic medium that we are confronted
  with human corporeal mortality. The audience identifies with some sense of
  humanness, or soul, that seems imbued in the synthetic, thereby reflexively
  projecting human emotions onto an inanimate projection.</p>
  <p>Drawing on concepts of liveness, techno-spirituality, and post-humanism
  (Auner, Auslander, Baudrillard, Hayles), this paper posits that <i>The End</i>
  both challenges traditional corporeal operatic staging and raises cogent
  philosophical questions surrounding the “human” condition, interrogating the
  boundaries between life and death and human and cyber life and thereby
  highlighting our increasingly spiritual relationships with technology. The
  work nevertheless also highlights mundane commercial considerations, for
  example the much-commented-about participation by Louis Vuitton in designing
  Miku’s costumes. I therefore show how technology and corporate marketing mix
  in a form of techno-spirituality that, much like traditional operatic staging,
  celebrates the use of <i>techne</i> to manipulate perceptions and create
  virtual realities which, in turn, impact our construction of reality. Miku
  presents an immaterial vision, recalling creation or resurrection myths, the
  veracity of which is both obscured and enhanced by the complex technological
  mediation of reality and virtuality.</p>
