    <p>Sciarrino’s writings describe a compositional philosophy that prizes multidimensionality and spatiotemporal discontinuity (1998, 2004). Yet his allegiance to teleology, physical metaphors, and “coincidences of the microcosm and macrocosm” (2004, 54) intimate an underlying unifying organicism. I analyze how these seemingly conflicting aesthetic priorities coexist within a single work, <em>Recitativo oscuro</em> (piano concerto, 1999), as the multiplicity of its temporal structuring serves as a counterweight to a motivically integrated, fractal construction.</p>
    <p>Kramer (1973, 1988) and Lochhead (1979) distinguish between beginning/ending functions suggested by musical material’s content and by its temporal position within a phrase or piece<em>.</em> Kramer’s “gestural time” refers to perceptions generated by the former when they conflict with the “absolute time” of the latter (1988, 168–89). This multilinearity can occur when temporal functions implied by a segment’s “sonic” (psychoacoustic) qualities, such as its intensity profile, consistently conflict with those implied by its “contextual” properties, such as its order position in a recurring series (Hanninen 2012; Boyle 2018). The opening piano solo of <em>Recitativo oscuro</em> is characterized by such conflict, first heard in microcosm in its opening gesture. As similar gestures accumulate to form longer segments and phrases, each mimics the original gesture’s intensity profile, mirroring its Janus-faced temporal implications at ever higher formal levels. The opening gesture thus serves as the passage’s <em>Grundgestalt,</em> providing both raw material for longer phrases and a blueprint for their shape. <em>Recitativo oscuro</em> demonstrates how Sciarrino manipulates intensity change and repetition at multiple formal levels to create a rich tapestry of temporal implications.</p>
