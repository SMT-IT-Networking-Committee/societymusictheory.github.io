  <p>In music scholarship, “groove-based” is often used as a synonym for popular
  music, in which the “groove” is a fixed accompanimental pattern repeated
  consistently throughout a work or section. However, grooves can structure
  temporal flow rather differently in music combining popular and experimental
  techniques. Craig Taborn and Kris Davis are two contemporary jazz
  composer-performers who often build works around dynamic and flexible grooves,
  sometimes extending the cyclic concept to generate other musical material as
  well. My analyses, which treat excerpts from Taborn’s solo album <i>Avenging
  Angel</i> and Davis’s notated piano suite <i>Eight Pieces for the Vernal
  Equinox</i>, demonstrate how these cycles use complex rhythmic groupings,
  variation, and beginning/ending ambiguity to generate a rich variety of
  temporal implications at both the local and formal level. Analyzing these
  post-tonal ostinati can enrich our understanding of meter, temporality, and
  process in repetitive music, as well as the porous boundaries of categories
  such as “groove-based.” However, while transcriptions or scores can support
  detailed work-based analysis, the artists’ identities as composers,
  performers, and improvisers give their material a complex ontological status,
  as grooves repeat not only within but also between works. I conclude with a
  discussion of this intertextuality and its implications for analysis.</p>
