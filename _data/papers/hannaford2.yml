    <p>Amid renewed calls for professional academic organizations to foster more inclusive communities, research, and pedagogy, we must present a more diverse history of music theory to our peers and students. Educator and lawyer Kiera O&rsquo;Shea Vargas (2019) argues for the importance of &ldquo;seeing yourself&rdquo;: diverse representation fosters multiple perspectives and a sense of belonging for those alienated by traditional, Eurocentric canons. Broadening our understanding of who and what counts in music theory can thus help welcome new people and ideas into our communities. </p>
    <p>My paper addresses this call by outlining a broad network of what I call fugitive music theory, which comprises music theoretical practices by black experimentalists and jazz musicians. Fugitive music theory comprises three categories: first, original texts; second, engagements with pre-existing music theoretical texts; and last, musicians&rsquo; metaphorical, conceptual, and metaphysical descriptions of their work, which serve as points of departure for analysis. I discuss examples from each of these groups and extract potent theoretical reverberations.</p>
    <p>My project resonates with work by Thomas Christensen (2011, 2015) and Steven Rings (2013) among others, who highlight discursive realms beyond those within conventional histories of music theory. I contribute to this conversation by foregrounding the racialized nature of disciplinary inclusion and exclusion: I suggest that broadening our understanding of who and what counts as part of our discipline benefits both our community and the intellectual work that it produces and embraces.</p>
