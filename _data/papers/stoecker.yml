Adès’s Violin Concerto"

    <p>Thomas Adès has often described the use of repetitive patterns and
    cycles in his music. Analyses by Roeder (2006, 2009, and 2014), Stoecker
    (2014, 2015, and 2016), Travers (2004), and Venn (2006, 2014, and 2017)
    have shown how Adès’s pitch patterns govern local, small-scale events.
    Venn further notes that “Adès frequently combines or extends [pitch
    cycles] in order to generate larger structures or even the premise behind
    entire movements” (2017a, 23). Building upon their work, this paper
    focuses on a large-scale form in Adès’s music—a somewhat neglected corner
    of scholarship to date—and the ways in which Adès uses pitch and rhythmic
    cycles to create a chaconne. This paper, then, focuses on the chaconne in
    the central movement of Adès’s Violin Concerto (2005).</p>
    <p>According to Adès, “[a] chaconne is simply one kind of harmonic motion.
    In my music it’s very often spiral rather than circular—in other words,
    it’s transposed down with each appearance …” (Adès and Service 2012, 7–8).
    Although Adès’s comments emphasize pitch rather than rhythm, this paper
    focuses on the temporal structures of Adès’s chaconne and how the solo
    violin sometimes agrees with, and sometimes contradicts with, the rhythmic
    continuities projected by the larger-scale harmonic progression of the
    chaconne. To date, the rhythmic structure of “Paths,” the central movement
    of the concerto, has been overlooked. This paper will thus demonstrate how
    Adès creates conflicts between the “stable,” spiraling chaconne
    progression and the rhythmically dissonant solo violin.</p>
