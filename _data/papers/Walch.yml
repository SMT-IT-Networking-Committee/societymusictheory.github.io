    <p>Even with numerous scholars extending chromatic-voice leading models to tonal music (a.o. Rings 2011; Tymoczko 2011; Cohn 2012), the origins and formal functions of sequential chromatic third relations in the 18<sup>th</sup> century remain opaque. Early instances of hexatonic cycles and Weitzmann regions cited by Cohn exhibit “double syntax”: Dominant-tonic syntax at the local level with middle-ground tonics related by parsimonious voice-leading. In this paper, I will triangulate a pluralist phenomenology of the chromatic major-third sequence that begins the first-movement development section of Mozart’s Divertimento for string trio in E♭, K. 563.  How, after the exposition’s B♭ major dominant area, does the sequence cast its terminal B♭ minor in a light that is equally expected <em>and</em> surprising? I argue that attention to register, voicing, and outer-voice counterpoint (salient to performers of this music) are key agents shaping the <em>telos</em> of these remarkable measures.</p>
    <p>A neo-Riemannian allows us to model some of the terminal B♭ minor’s startling effect, revealing the end of the sequence as a break in a “zig-zag” path through incomplete N/R and L/P chains that flesh out successively more complete key areas. A Schenkerian approach captures the linear derivation of the implied F♯ minor from B♭ via chromatic 5-6 motion. Yet the prioritization of linearity risks flattening the intervallic diversity of Mozart’s outer-voice counterpoint. Far from mere surface phenomenon, this counterpoint serves as a cue to <em>prima vista</em> players as to where their parts may be headed, revealing this “purple patch” as chromatic structure with a social dimension.</p>
