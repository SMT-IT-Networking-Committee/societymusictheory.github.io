title: 'Meter as Template: Metric Allusion in Music by Thomas Adès'

abstract: |
    <p>In describing how listeners establish and maintain a sense of meter,
    psychologically and experientially oriented metric theories often focus on
    particular musical events, through interpretation of accents and grouping
    or projection of individual musical durations into the immediate future.
    This attention to the moment-by-moment unfolding of music in time is
    essential for explaining the ability to synchronize with precise and
    changing temporal organization, but the complementary role of past
    experience in shaping listeners’ metric interpretations remains mostly
    unexplored. In this presentation, I argue that most listeners bring to a
    new piece of music a learned, largely unconscious repertoire of meters
    that function as templates, simplifying the process of inferring meter by
    providing strong expectations for when sounds will occur.</p>

    <p>In principle, these learned expectations influence metric induction in
    any music. Music by Thomas Adès offers an apt demonstration of the
    phenomenon because of Adès’s practice of alluding to familiar meters by
    presenting their rhythmic patterns in attenuated or distorted form.
    Analyses of score excerpts and timing from recorded performances
    illustrate how Adès invokes familiar metric templates by manipulating
    rhythm and by using other characteristics that typically occur in
    conjunction with unequivocal meters, including tertian harmonies and
    conventional handling of dissonance, dynamics, and timbre. These examples
    highlight the integral part that past experience plays in metric hearing
    and draw attention to the relationship among notation, sound, and
    perception.</p>
