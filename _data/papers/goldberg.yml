abstract: |
  <p>Meter in music for numerous dances from southeastern Europe is
  conventionally defined in terms of sequences of beats with two categorically
  different durations, short and long, notated in a ratio of 2:3. Common beat
  sequences include long-short-short, short-short-long, short-short-short-long,
  and short-short-long-short-short. The range of beat sequences in this
  repertoire has long motivated speculation about how one meter could be
  transformed into another. Whereas most previous authors focus on the
  conventional beat sequence in defining metric transformations, this
  presentation instead takes dance steps as a starting point for suggesting
  relationships among meters.</p>
  <p>Dancers from southeastern Europe sometimes use essentially the same pattern
  of steps when dancing to pieces of music that have different beat sequences.
  For example, a dance known as <i>devetorka</i> (among other names) is done to
  music that would normally be notated in 9/16 with a four-beat,
  short-short-short-long sequence. Another dance, <i>gankino horo</i>, follows
  nearly the same pattern of steps as <i>devetorka</i>, but its music is
  understood to have a five-beat sequence with a time signature of 11/16.</p>
  <p>Based on several such pairings, I identify two classes of transformations
  between southeast European dance meters: expansion/contraction of the metric
  cycle, which <i>devetorka </i>and <i>gankino horo</i> exemplify, and
  addition/subtraction at the beginning of the cycle. In light of
  psychologically informed metric theory, these mappings between dances point to
  the importance of a metric layer with durations longer than the conventional
  beats, and suggest that different manipulations of the beat sequence carry
  different implications for metric embodiment.</p>
