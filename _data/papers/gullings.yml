abstract: |
    <p>When I adopted the “textbook” <em>Open Music Theory (OMT)</em> in 2015, I knew no other instructors making the same leap. As a composer by trade, I felt out of my depth. This first-hand experience informs my talk, which covers the benefits and problems associated with my switch to <em>OMT</em>, and describes our panel’s improvements in <em>OMT</em> version 2 (<em>OMT2</em>).</p>
    <p><em>OMT</em> saves students money. Additionally, it is equally as effective as proprietary texts: average semester grades and course evaluation numbers remained steady after my switch to <em>OMT</em>. This affirms John Hilton III’s 2016 finding that open educational resources (OER) are “comparable in quality to traditional learning resources.”</p>
    <p>The most significant challenge of <em>OMT</em> was the lack of accompanying workbook, which I overcame by authoring 109 assignments and other course documents. <em>OMT2</em> includes all these, together with many newly-designed assignments, as its free and fully-editable companion workbook. Another obstacle was the lack of built-in chapter sequencing, requiring a reevaluation of my four-semester curriculum. This problem is addressed in our third talk, “Not Just a Theory…,” which discusses community creation of <em>OMT2</em> content guides.</p>
    <p>In 2017–18, 13% of U.S. faculty used OER in at least one course, up from 5% two years prior (Babson Survey Research Group 2018). Despite their advantages, there are fewer available OER in music theory than in other academic fields. <em>OMT2</em> fills this need for theorists, and for the numerous applied instructors, ensemble directors, and other generalists that often teach theory courses. It is adoption-ready and poised to make a difference in classrooms everywhere.</p>
