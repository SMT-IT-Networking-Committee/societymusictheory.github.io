    <p>Theorists have long been fascinated by the rhythmic and metric particularities of jazz improvisers. Much of this fascination has centered around those aspects of rhythm that are not easily notatable, especially expressive microtiming, rubato, and cross-rhythm. Among the chief distinctions that can be made between such techniques is whether they occur at or below the syntactical level. While participatory discrepancies—slight deviations from an idealized prototypical tactus that compound when musicians play together—mostly fall below the level of musical syntax, microtiming can also inflect larger utterances on the syntactical level, creating gestures that stimulate group interaction.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I examine the relationship between jazz interaction and two expressive metric devices,  “pulling apart,” and “floating above”, both of which involve the simultaneous sounding of two conflicting pulse streams. “Pulling apart” refers to moments when improvisers’ delays or anticipations suggest a slowing or quickening of tempo that conflicts with the prevailing tempo, resulting in a temporary disconnect that produces microrhythmic ambiguity before eventually resolving. “Floating above” occurs when an improviser’s utterance is untethered from the groove projected by the rest of the ensemble. I argue that such utterances arise from the interactional matrix of jazz improvisation and are therefore best analyzed using theories of improvisational interaction. As irreducibly interactive gestures, instances of metric divergence are a product of the Afrological orientation of jazz improvisation; by considering these metric techniques to be fundamentally dialogic, I seek to highlight the symbiotic relationship between elements of metric divergence and cultural aesthetics.</p>
