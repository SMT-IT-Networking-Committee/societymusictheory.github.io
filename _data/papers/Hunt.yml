abstract: | 
    <p>This paper will argue that “problematic” or “inconvenient” sonata-rondo movements such as Haydn’s “Clock” symphony finale should not be defined negatively (as a flawed or “lesser” sonata-rondo form) or experientally (a midstream conversion or “becoming” from Type 4 to rondo), but rather as descendants of a form I term “expositional X-part rondo,” which originated for Mozart and Haydn in their finales as early as the 1760s.  Their first couplet-episode (AB) pair forms a sonata exposition (by galant standards, using Burstein’s recently revived Kochian terms such as <em>Grundabsätze</em> and <em>Quintabsätze</em>, as well as the <em>modulating Prinner</em>), and then proceeds to the standard couplet-episode (AC, AD, etc.) layout until complete; the expositional materials never return. This form can be seen in Mozart’s early Violin Sonata K. 26, as well as in pieces that Cole and Fisher cite as Haydn’s first attempts at sonata-rondo (e.g., his 64<sup>th</sup> symphony).  As the generic norms of their sonata forms began to take shape in the 1770s, both Mozart and Haydn began to add a section late in the pieces, perhaps to compensate for the lack of the return of expositional materials, a section I label a “balancing” section. In sum, this presentation will seek to train a less anachronistic lens on these pieces using important recent <em>Formenlehre</em> studies. Once a more flexible idea of a sonata exposition is thereby established, the well-trodden lineage of the form that Cole, Fisher and Fillion outlined in Haydn’s works can be extended back even further back to the 1760s.   </p>
