  <p>In musicals, plays, and pageants African American authors told the story of black people in America through popular entertainment designed for integrated audiences. Rather than adhere to white supremacist narratives that reinforced images of subservience and primitivism, black authors and composers found ways to dignify and humanize their characters. Writers used Africa to provide images of an alternative black homeland and as an exotic setting for a clash between cultures.</p>
  <p>I examine four musicals containing references to Africa, written and performed by African Americans. Author William MacClain billed his <i>Before and After the War</i> (1894) as a “spectacular comedy” that told the story of the “Evolution of the Negro . . . from Savage to Congress.” W. E. B. Du Bois’s <i>The Star of Ethiopia</i> (1913) also traces black history from Africa to the parlors of the educated middle class, but casts Ethiopia as the site of strength for African Americans rather than an archaic homeland. <i>In Dahomey</i> (1903) and <i>Abyssinia</i> (1906) use stories of displaced African Americans in Africa to communicate political insights that are couched in comedy. Rather than recounting black history, these shows tell “fish out of water” stories of African Americans returning to an exotic African landscape.</p>
  <p>Drawing upon Daphne Brooks’s theories of racial performativity, I argue that depictions of Africa and Africans in these productions demonstrate the many, sometimes conflicting, images circulating among the black intelligentsia about the continent. African characters and settings sometimes reflected black nationalist conceptions of Africa as a genuine homeland that could serve as a source of strength and contemporary resistance to American oppression. African characters are also sometimes portrayed as pagan savages who are either no match for black Americans’ sophistication or are the uncivilized ancestors of the cultured and genteel black middle class. These seemingly contradictory visions of Africa present transnational conceptions of blackness and demonstrate that these productions are more than simply a rebuttal to the legacy of minstrelsy. They grapple with the diversity of opinions among black intellectuals about respectability, authenticity, and the role of race in American society.</p>
