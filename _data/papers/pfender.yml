  <p>The history of magnetic recording and playback technology is virtually
  coextensive with that of sound recording writ large. In 1878, Oberlin Smith,
  chief engineer of the Ferracute Machine Company in New Jersey, witnessed
  Thomas Edison’s phonograph. He was familiar with principles of metalworking
  and magnetism, and intuited that translating a sound into electrical current
  would reduce the phonograph’s mechanical noise. Subsequently (1888), Smith
  published provisional designs for a magnetic recorder which used steel dust
  woven into textile thread; that publication would have circulated to Valdemar
  Poulsen, nominal inventor of the wire recorder. The principles of Smith’s
  machine also prefigured the design (oxide lacquered to paper tape) that major
  German manufacturers BASF and AEG would realize in refining tape technology
  fifty years later.</p>
  <p>In September 1887, Smith published “If Material, Why Mortal?” in the<i>
  Andover Review</i>, in which he ruminates on the metaphysics of a materialist
  theology. He analogizes the mechanical and electric operation of the mind (and
  thus the soul) to “that to-be-invented instrument of the future, a
  transmitting-phonograph or recording-telephone.” Hewing close to Aquinas’s
  view that we are “matter articulate, stuff that speaks,” Smith deems the
  phonograph a schematically appropriate but insufficiently refined heuristic
  for the “mighty enginery of [his] Creator.” Applied magnetism, with which he
  had worked for decades, held out the possibility that divinity was immanent in
  the phenomenal world as an invisible yet potent force, like electric current
  through metal.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that Oberlin Smith’s position as a Gilded Age
  captain of industry produced his belief in the malleability of mundane,
  divine, and intermundane worlds. Moreover, his magnetic recorder was a product
  of that worldview, and is legible through the materialist theology he derived
  from his domination of physical matter. Elaborating on the intercourse between
  rough materiality and rarefaction in cutting-edge nineteenth-century American
  technology, I historicize the form and function of magnetic tape through
  Smith’s conviction that every material wonder is “only the change that the
  chimes of God are ringing upon that which we call matter.”</p>
