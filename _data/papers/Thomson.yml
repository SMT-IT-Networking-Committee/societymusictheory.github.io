    <p>Cyclical thematic units preceding a main theme, occasionally described as mottos, occur in several of Mendelssohn’s and Schumann’s orchestral works. Horton (2013) identifies mottos in three Schumann symphonies, and Vande Moortele (2017) observes similar cases in three Mendelssohn overtures. Building on their work, this paper examines how Niels Gade (1817–1890) manipulates his mottos, particularly at expositional boundaries, to express different formal functions (after Caplin 1998), thereby expanding on precedents set by Mendelssohn and Schumann.</p>
    <p>Gade’s mottos in the opening movements of four of his symphonies express different formal functions at multiple levels and play active roles in their respective sonata forms proper, thus crossing the boundary of introductory parageneric space (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006). Vande Moortele expands on Caplin’s “beginning” function and Hepokoski and Darcy’s four “characteristic zones” for slow introductions with five distinct units: prefatory, initiating, medial, closing, and epilogic, which I adapt to explore the different roles mottos play within expositions. Gade’s mottos often mark beginnings <em>and</em> endings of expositions, thus approaching Hepokoski and Darcy’s rotational understanding of sonata form. In the sixth symphony, for instance, the once prefatory motto becomes epilogic as it returns to round off the exposition. In contrast, the placement of repeat barlines in Symphony No. 5 omits the first motto, urging the listener to reinterpret the boundaries of the main theme group. The analyses in this paper demonstrate Gade’s development of motto techniques and suggest another angle from which to consider cyclicism in 19<sup>th</sup>-century sonata forms.</p>
