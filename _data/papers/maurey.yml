abstract: |
  <p>At the heart of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris lie some of the most prized
  relics of Christendom, namely the Crown of Thorns and other Passion relics.
  King Louis IX (1214–70) conceived and built the church expressly to house these
  relics, which soon became a monument at once to the Passion of Christ and to
  the cult of kingship. The so-called Sainte-Chapelle Proser (copied between 1250
  and 1270) transmits 156 sequences for the Sanctorale, of which twenty-two are
  dedicated to a single group of feasts originating at the Sainte-Chapelle. Most
  of these sequences are <i>unica</i>, and have never been published or studied
  before. There are four for the Dedication feast (26 April), nine for the Crown
  of Thorns (11 August) and nine for the Reception of Relics (30 September). The
  excessive amount of sequences per feast would have allowed for a most rigorous
  veneration, with sequences dotting not only the feast-day itself, but also each
  and every day during the octave.</p>
  <p>Inert objects, relics could not accomplish much without being “activated”
  one way or the other. One of the most effective ways in which churches could
  lay claim to relics was by liturgy. The paper examines the ways in which these
  twenty-two sequences articulate ideologies central to the spiritual and
  political messages of the Sainte-Chapelle in particular and of the Capetian
  dynasty in general. It explores the musical and theological underpinnings of
  these sequences, mostly originating in circles close to the French monarchy,
  including the Dominican Order. The arrival of the relics in France gave rise to
  an elaborate liturgical apparatus through which France was imagined to be the
  rightful possessor of those relics, as if order had been restored and
  historical justice made.</p>
  <p>The paper demonstrates how, through these sequences, Paris became a holy
  city, a “Second Jerusalem,” and the expected place of the Second Coming. It is
  mainly through liturgy that we can understand what these relics meant at the
  Sainte-Chapelle and at the French Court, how they connected the royal and the
  salvific, and how they became a musical monument of authority.</p>
