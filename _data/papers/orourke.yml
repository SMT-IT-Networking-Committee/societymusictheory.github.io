    <p>This paper reconsiders the origins and significance of Gioseffo Zarlino’s listener concept, or <em>soggetto ben disposto</em>(well-disposed subject), which the theorist introduces in Part 2, chapter 7, of <em>Le istitutioni harmoniche</em> (1558) as one of four ingredients necessary for moving the emotions through music. Pace Moreno (2004), who dismisses the <em>soggetto ben disposto</em> as both theoretically shallow and “ancillary” to Zarlino’s larger project, I demonstrate that this concept in fact stems from a rich theoretical tradition around listening, albeit a nonmusical one—namely rhetoric. In particular, I argue that Zarlino lifted the conceptual scaffolding for his <em>soggetto</em> from vernacular commentaries on the recently recovered <em>Rhetoric </em>of Aristotle. Bartolomeo Cavalcanti’s <em>La retorica</em> (published in 1559, but drafted in the 1540s) is one candidate. In discussing the mental states of those “subjects ready to receive emotions” in rhetorical contexts, Cavalcanti adopts a vocabulary strikingly similar to Zarlino’s. Most telling of the connection, both theorists maintain that listening subjects must be “prepared and disposed” (<em>preparati, e disposti</em>), or predisposed, to be moved. </p>
    <p>Hitherto unacknowledged, the rhetorical foundations of Zarlino’s listener have implications for his theory of music and emotions writ large (<em>Ist. harm.</em> II.7–9). Most importantly, the concept of emotional “predisposition” baked into Zarlino’s <em>soggetto ben disposto</em> finds complementary expression in the theorist’s account of how different kinds of music stimulate different kinds of emotional responses. Hardly ancillary, then, Zarlino’s listener concept and its rhetorical origins open up new avenues for research into his theoretical project and counter the notion that he always subordinates sensation to numerical verity.</p>
