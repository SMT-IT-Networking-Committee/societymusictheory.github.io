    <p>This paper explores the possibilities of metric transformation when one
    song samples material from another. Most commonly associated with hip-hop
    and electronic dance music, and part of the broader tradition of musical
    “borrowing,” sampling has offered a rich framework for investigations into
    intertextuality, legality, ethics, and advancements in music-making
    technology (Katz 2004; Schloss 2004; Williams 2013). Few analyses to date,
    however, have examined in detail the ways that existing materials are
    transformed metrically in new settings.</p>
    <p>Drawing on examples from Pusha T, A Tribe Called Quest, Jeru the
    Damaja, and Frank Ocean that feature prominent “structural samples”
    (Sewell 2013, 26), I theorize four categories of sample-transforming
    techniques that can be employed singly or in combination: tempo shift,
    which can also affect pitch and timbre; “chopping,” the cutting-up and
    reordering of a sample; truncation, the reduction of a sample’s metric
    unit; and recontextualization, which involves a re-casting from one meter
    to another. Transcription-based comparisons between these samples and
    their sources (which range from Jack DeJohnette to MGMT) reveal how
    producers use these techniques to both articulate and problematize
    features such as phrase structure, hypermeter, and metric accent (Lerdahl
    and Jackendoff 1983). The craft of rappers in manipulating rhythmic and
    metric structures in their vocal delivery, or “flow,” is by now well
    recognized; this paper turns our attention to a similar craft in their
    sample-based accompaniments.</p>
