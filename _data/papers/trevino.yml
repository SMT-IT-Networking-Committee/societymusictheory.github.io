handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Celebrated music producer, engineer and owner of San Antonio’s acclaimed
  Blue Cat Recording Studio, Joe Treviño joins one of Tejano’s most sought-after
  <i>bajo sexto </i>players, composers and producers, Max Baca (Los Texmaniacs,
  Flaco Jiménez, etc.). Both are articulate, well-informed music and industry
  insiders who have worked with all of the artists mentioned in this session’s
  papers. They offer insightful commentary and observations on many issues
  examined and critiqued in the scholarly papers. Additionally, Treviño and Baca
  will discuss the creative process in the recording studio, revealing how
  Tejano musicians, engineers and producers strike a balance between community
  expectations, creativity, innovation and the local, regional and (in some
  cases) global market. Cathy Ragland will moderate this response/discussion
  with Treviño and Baca. She has also worked with Treviño as producer of two of
  Ybarra’s recordings for Rounder Records.</p>
