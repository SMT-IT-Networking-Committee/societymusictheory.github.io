abstract: |
  <p>Although much has been written about the Kurt Weill of Germany and America,
  little has been written about the works he composed for France and Britain.
  Weill experienced some commercial success in Britain with a B.B.C. radio
  broadcast of <i>The Threepenny Opera</i> in 1933 and several translated stage
  works. <i>A Kingdom for a Cow</i> (Savoy Theatre, 1935), his sole operetta
  composed for the London stage (a reworking of the German work <i>Der
  Kuhhandel</i>), was a clear attempt to ingratiate himself into the world of
  British theater—a move that was quickly dismissed by critics and the public.
  The tale of an arms race on a fictional South American island, this work
  occupies a curious aesthetic space between Weill’s German and American works.
  Further, the response by the British press and public is illuminating in terms
  of the enmeshing of political identity and musical theater.</p>
  <p>Weill was plagued by the problem of possessing an inconvenient identity in
  a time of political upheaval. He was both German and Jewish, factors that the
  British public and press were unable to reconcile because of
  prevailing—although often masked—anti-Semitism, and an initial ambivalence
  towards an ascendant Germany. These complicated layers of his identity were
  exacerbated by the dismissive characterization of his works by the British
  press. Because of these factors the reception of Weill’s work was in stark
  contrast to the adulation of imported American musicals by figures such as
  Cole Porter and Oscar Hammerstein II, or the continued fondness for the
  Austro-Germanic operettas that remained in vogue well into the 1940s. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I examine the history of <i>A Kingdom for A Cow</i> through
  the lenses of transnationalism and reception history in order to establish
  Weill’s complex relationship with the London Theater. I expand on recent
  scholarship that deals with form and genre in Weill’s work and investigate
  critical and political forces of reception. By exploring this work in the
  context of British theater, we are better able to understand the ways in which
  political and cultural influences dramatically altered musical theater in
  London leading up to the Second World War. </p>
