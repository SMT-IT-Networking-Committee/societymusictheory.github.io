    <p>This paper considers theoretical properties of 72-tone equal
    temperament and their usage in Georg Friedrich Haas’s <i>limited
    approximations </i>(2010), scored for six microtonally tuned pianos and
    orchestra. I argue that Haas’s oft-cited relationship to the French
    spectral school is best exemplified not in his technical praxis—which is
    starkly dissimilar from the high-tech preoccupations of spectral composers
    like Tristan Murail or Kaija Saariaho—but in Haas’s broader aesthetic
    orientation to the concept of liminality, also a spectral hallmark.
    72-tone equal temperament affords him a technical infrastructure in which
    to move smoothly between systems of pitch organization or, more often, to
    explore the transitional space not only between tuning systems but also
    between pitch and timbre, and consonance and dissonance. In <i>limited
    approximations </i>this encourages hearing the piece as manifesting an
    uneasy sound world characterized by murky, grotesque sonorities that give
    way to beautiful but fleeting moments of clarity, like objects in a heat
    haze coming into focus. I take those moments of systemic clarity to be
    aurally marked events that guide the listener through a piece that
    otherwise lacks recurring formal or motivic elements, and my analysis
    draws attention to those moments.</p>
