title: "Vocal Synthesis and Figural Narratives in Grisey’s Les Chants de l’Amour"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>My paper examines the genesis, compositional structure, and programmatic
  narrative of spectral composer Gérard Grisey’s 1984 work <i>Les Chants de
  l’Amour </i>for 12-voice SATB choir and tape. Statements by Grisey (2008) have
  evinced an attitude toward sound reminiscent of Pierre Schaeffer’s
  <i>entendre, </i>an intentional mode of listening that seeks to attend to
  sound as such, rather than to its material or cultural indices. At first
  glance, <i>Les Chants de l’Amour </i>sits uneasily in relation to this
  attitude by virtue of its figurative narrative elements: throughout the piece
  the tape part takes on the persona of another singer, alternately
  antagonistic, harmonious, erotic, alien, monstrous. My analysis suggests that
  the capabilities of Grisey’s synthesis software partly informed these
  narrative elements.</p>
  <p>Grisey created the tape component of the thirty-five-minute piece using the
  CHANT physical modeling synthesis software, developed at IRCAM beginning in
  1979. Physical modeling marked an important conceptual shift in the interface
  of digital synthesis: it focused on programming parameters related to the
  means and materials of producing a sound, rather than designing the resultant
  waveforms. Knowledge of vocal production and physiology conditioned the
  variables of the CHANT software, and the CHANT software in turn conditioned a
  number of strange and imaginative possibilities for what a voice could do. The
  rhetorical and narrative elements in <i>Les Chants de l’Amour </i>illuminate
  points of convergence between the corporeal-minded parameters of Grisey’s
  software and the abstract timbral and formal features idiomatic to spectral
  music. </p>
