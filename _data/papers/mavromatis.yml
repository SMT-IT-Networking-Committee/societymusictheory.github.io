  <p>This paper presents a framework for modeling the structure of improvised
  music using Hierarchical Markov Models, a natural extension of simple Markov
  Models (Ames 1989; Mavromatis 2012; White and Quinn 2018). The latter
  represent musical structure as a dynamic process using graphs with circles
  representing basic objects (notes, chords, etc.) and arrows specifying their
  allowed successions. A hierarchy of simple Markov Models represents patterns
  at different levels of musical structure, showing how notes combine to create
  melodic formulas; how formulas become building blocks for phrase prototypes;
  and how phrase prototypes give rise to larger formal units. This approach
  unifies and refines previous structural analyses of improvisation that use
  successions of event clusters (Pressing 1988) or generative grammars
  (Johnson-Laird 1991, 2002). The formalism is illustrated using select examples
  of formulaic systems from Christian chant (Treitler 1974; Mavromatis 2005),
  Arabic maqam (abu Shumays 2013), and other world music idioms.</p>
  <p>This framework has important implications for music cognition. As a model
  for memory organization in improvisation, it can efficiently represent an
  expert improviserâ€™s knowledge in long-term memory in a hierarchical and
  easily-accessible form, thereby reducing working memory load in real-time
  decision making. Moreover, the framework can address issues surrounding oral
  tradition in music, such as exactness vs. variability in reconstruction during
  recall, and the continuum between composition and improvisation. Finally, the
  present approach can extend the scope of schema theory beyond the galant
  style, connecting it to mental mechanisms reflected in a broad array of
  musical styles across the globe.</p>
