    <p>The emergent dialogue surrounding traditional music in Japanese classrooms is one with significant implications for musicians worldwide reevaluating conservatory-style musical-theoretical models that have dominated globally since the nineteenth century. The koto has a special role in this dialogue, not only for its predominant role in this newly-developing Japanese classroom music education, but for its multimelodic sonic characteristics and decentralized, plurivocal transmission methods. In 2002, Japan’s Ministry of Education (MEXT) implemented significant changes to the country’s national K-12 music education policy, which had previously all but excluded autochthonous Japanese genres. In fulfilling this difficult requirement, music teachers have been forced to invent new pedagogical models for Japanese music, often reclaiming, reimagining, or choosing to ignore Euro-American musical-theoretical terms and concepts in the process. Drawing from my research with these music educators, I propose an approach to music theory education which reevaluates the centrality of “scale” in music analysis in favor of divergent, sometimes contradictory methods, grounded in embodied musical practice.</p>
