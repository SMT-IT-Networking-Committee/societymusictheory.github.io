abstract: |
  <p>In the study of theme and variations, form has been overlooked, as the
  prevailing view is that variations share form-functional organization with the
  theme. William Caplin articulates the view thus: “The variations that follow
  the main theme normally adhere not only to its overall form . . . but also to
  its specific arrangement of intrathematic functions.” This may be true for the
  late-classical variations in Caplin’s study, but in the variations of later
  eras formal function is itself varied in creative ways. I show that
  Prokofiev’s variation movements of 1921–25 (opp. 26, 39, 40) display three
  novel techniques of form-functional modification: <i>alteration</i>, which
  retains the melodic-motivic material but changes the function;
  <i>extraction</i>, which removes a section of the structure; and
  <i>insertion</i>, which adds a section to the structure. Crucially, these
  modifications are maintained in subsequent variations, so that the underlying
  theme is itself gradually transformed.</p>
  <p>My study builds on recent work arguing that Prokofiev’s approach to form is
  more innovative than previously thought. More broadly, in outlining three
  techniques of modification, I argue that variation movements deserve closer
  formal scrutiny. Finally, I demonstrate how form-functional analysis can be
  adapted to twentieth-century repertoire.</p>
