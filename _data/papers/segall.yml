    <p>Theories of formal function view musical events in terms of beginnings, middles, and ends. These temporal locations are cued not just by literal position but also by musical characteristics. Form-functional theories furthermore posit that not all themes contain a beginning <em>and</em> a middle <em>and</em> an end. Some themes sound as though they begin “in the middle.” Lacking a beginning function, they start immediately with material associated with functional middles. I’ll expand this concept to a broader scale and examine sonata-form works whose expositions begin “in the middle,” bypassing main-theme function and proceeding directly to transition function. Such works—I offer Beethoven’s Op. 101 as a <em>locus classicus</em>—produce a complex temporal experience bound to a Romantic sensibility of listening and reinterpretation.</p>
