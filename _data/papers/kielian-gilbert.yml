    <p>What does it mean to listen from a position of privilege? How or do our social-relational positions show up in the language we use, the analysis we do, and/or in the ways we listen and hear? When and as music emerges from deep lived and emotional experience, what happens to its vividness under the lens of music theory and analysis?</p>
    <p>A materialist and performative “turn” to processes of musical embodiment shifts from categorizing difference to dramatizing and enacting its physical/material and social-relational dimensions. Experiential, processive, and (inter)subjective dimensions come to the fore—<em>temporal</em> (layers of temporal implication open to each other), <em>material/physical</em> (connections through “transversal” encounters), and <em>emergent</em> (form-changing transformations).</p>
    <p>Nina Simone’s performances of “Little Girl Blue” from her first album (1959) and <em>Live at Montreux 1976</em> draw attention to ways of dramatizing and bringing music to life, and contend with her jazz- and classical-oriented training as a pianist in a racially divisive world. I emphasize the relational/(inter)subjective and processive/“in-between” character of musical embodiment in dramatizing and affecting listeners’ relationships to music sound.</p>
    <p>In reclaiming musical embodiment, the field of music theory inescapably expands to encompass a range of social/relational and identity practices: listening to and hearing multiple and occluded voices, confronting patriarchal orders of power, and destabilizing binaries of difference and identity. Musical embodiments materialize interdependent and changing interactions of identity and community yielding our and music’s capacities to affect and be affected—to listen inside out and outside in.</p>
