      bio: |
        <p>Marianne Kielian-Gilbert, Professor of Music in The Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University, Bloomington:</p>
        <p>I am particularly interested in connecting music experience to listeners’ emotional and intellectual responses and to social-material conditions and medium/media settings. I have explored relationships between music, philosophy, feminist theory, cultural and disability studies in thinking about how performative acts can shape, embody, and vivify music and music experience.</p>
        <p>In addition to the music of composers such as Stravinsky and Britten I have been working on a set of essays on music of recent women composers, and iconic, mythic and popular female figures in music: “Dissonant Bells: <em>The Rite’s</em> ‘Sacrificial Dance,’ 1913/2013” (IU Press, 2017); “Compassion with the Abyss”: Sensory Estrangement in Britten’s Late Works, <em>Death in Venice,</em> Op. 88, and <em>Phaedra,</em> Op. 93” (Cambridge Scholars, 2017); and “Experiencing Chen Yi’s music: Local and Cosmopolitan Reciprocities in <em>Ning for pipa, violin and cello</em> (2001)” (<em>Music Theory Online</em>, 2020).</p>

title: "Dramatizing Difference: Embodying Music’s Materiality and (Inter)subjective Dynamics (Nina Simone’s “Little Girl Blue” from Live at Montreux 1976)"
abstract: |
    <p>What does it mean to listen from a position of privilege? How or do our social-relational positions show up in the language we use, the analysis we do, and/or in the ways we listen and hear? When and as music emerges from deep lived and emotional experience, what happens to its vividness under the lens of music theory and analysis?</p>
    <p>A materialist and performative “turn” to processes of musical embodiment shifts from categorizing difference to dramatizing and enacting its physical/material and social-relational dimensions. Experiential, processive, and (inter)subjective dimensions come to the fore—<em>temporal</em> (layers of temporal implication open to each other), <em>material/physical</em> (connections through “transversal” encounters), and <em>emergent</em> (form-changing transformations).</p>
    <p>Nina Simone’s performances of “Little Girl Blue” from her first album (1959) and <em>Live at Montreux 1976</em> draw attention to ways of dramatizing and bringing music to life, and contend with her jazz- and classical-oriented training as a pianist in a racially divisive world. I emphasize the relational/(inter)subjective and processive/“in-between” character of musical embodiment in dramatizing and affecting listeners’ relationships to music sound.</p>
    <p>In reclaiming musical embodiment, the field of music theory inescapably expands to encompass a range of social/relational and identity practices: listening to and hearing multiple and occluded voices, confronting patriarchal orders of power, and destabilizing binaries of difference and identity. Musical embodiments materialize interdependent and changing interactions of identity and community yielding our and music’s capacities to affect and be affected—to listen inside out and outside in.</p>
