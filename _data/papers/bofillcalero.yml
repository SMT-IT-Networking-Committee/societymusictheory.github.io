title: "Performing Jíbaro Music: Theoretical Perspectives"

abstract: |
  <p>Improvisation in <i>décima</i> is revered as the most elevated performance
  practice in the jíbaro music tradition. Décima, a ten-line poetic form, is
  typically performed by <i>trovadores</i> (troubadors) in <i>controversias</i>,
  poetic-duels in which they test their wit and knowledge on variety of topics.
  Though décima performance is seemingly a “spontaneous act,” it actually
  involves a great deal of a priori knowledge and skill primarily acquired
  through oral transmission. Drawing on theories of performance from both oral
  and literate traditions from around the world (Lord 1960, Nettl 1998,
  Gjerdingen 2007, Clarke 1988), I propose theoretical models which outline the
  generative processes in jíbaro improvisation and provide a closer
  understanding to the question of “how musicians do what they do” in the course
  of performance. </p>
