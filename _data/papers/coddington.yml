abstract: |
    <p>In 1989, when <i>Billboard </i>introduced its first chart devoted to
    hip-hop, the song appearing at number five caused considerable consternation.
    Milli Vanilli’s “Girl You Know It’s True,” according to one reader, was “not
    rap,” despite featuring rapped vocals. The question of how to classify this
    song illuminates hip-hop’s messy musical boundaries. In this paper, I examine
    the disciplinary stakes at the heart of the debate over what counts as hip-hop
    and how it differs from rap. In doing so, I encourage scholars to think about
    who hip-hop studies excludes when we draw strict boundaries around the diverse
    culture of hip-hop.</p>
