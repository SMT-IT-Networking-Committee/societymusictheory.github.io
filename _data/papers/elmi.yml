  <p>This paper explores the cultural and social contexts in which
  Italian-texted song was composed and performed in the Aragonese Kingdom of
  Naples. Its main argument posits that improvisational lyric composition and
  song were central practices of the Neapolitan aristocracy, both in the city
  itself and at feudal courts throughout southern Italy. </p>
  <p>Studies of music and poetry in southern Italy during the late fifteenth
  century, by Allan Atlas and Gianluca D’Agostino, among others, have tended to
  focus largely on the centralized royal court of the Aragonese family at the
  Castelnuovo in Naples, its musical chapel, and the related intellectual
  institution of the <i>Accademia Pontaniana.</i> Yet, the Castelnuovo was only
  one of many active court environments in the expansive geo-political region
  encompassed by the Kingdom of Naples, which also included the Aragonese ducal
  court at the Castel Capuano in Naples as well as various smaller feudal courts
  held by land-owning Neapolitan barons throughout southern Italy.</p>
  <p>The surviving Neapolitan song repertory and its preservation in
  late-Quattrocento musical and literary sources bear witness not only to these
  varied performance contexts, but also to the inherently communal aspect of the
  tradition as a whole. Allegorical representations of Neapolitan song in Iacopo
  Sannazaro’s <i>Arcadia</i>, for example, emphasize community and communal
  practice through a pastoral lens, demonstrating the social importance of
  song-making within a prosimetric literary framework. Furthermore, extant
  manuscript copies of Italian-texted song from southern Italy—such as the music
  manuscript Perugia, Biblioteca Comunale “Augusta,” Ms. 431 and the literary
  anthology in Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vaticano latino
  10656—preserve evidence of such communal practices through their overwhelming
  tendency toward anonymity, as well as other codicological and paleographic
  elements.</p>
  <p>Understanding southern Italian song as a tradition that was practiced from
  court to court—varying in function and context—throughout the Kingdom of
  Naples demonstrates its significance and malleability at numerous levels of
  cultural and intellectual life.</p>
