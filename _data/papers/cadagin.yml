abstract: |
  <p>In a 2007 <i>in memoriam</i> for György Ligeti, Hungarian composer György
  Kurtág recalls his final phone call with his friend and compatriot, during
  which the bedridden Ligeti declared, “I want to write <i>Alice</i>.” Coming as
  it does at the end of his long and fruitful career, the unfinished
  music-theater piece based on the books of Lewis Carroll leaves a question mark
  hanging over Ligeti’s compositional output. Although scholars have drawn in
  recent years on autograph manuscripts to analyze Ligeti’s completed
  compositions, little attention has been paid to the fragmentary projects that
  occupied him at the end of his life. In this paper, I piece together the
  composer’s correspondences, interviews, and sketches to form a clearer picture
  of his magnum opus that was never to be. While this is by no means a
  reconstruction of the mostly non-existent score, my study will offer a general
  sense of what this Carrollian “theatrical fantasy” may have looked and sounded
  like, providing insights into Ligeti’s eclectic and underexamined late
  style.</p>
  <p>The nearly two hundred pages of sketch material for <i>Alice</i> date from
  the late 1970s to the early 2000s, when Ligeti stopped composing due to
  illness. Many of his handwritten notes deal with practical staging matters:
  possible directors, singers, and ensembles, as well as a summary of scenes.
  Only one page of notated music exists—the outline for a rabbit-hole prelude
  based on the infinitely descending Shepard-tone illusion. But Ligeti’s prose
  descriptions of musical ideas give us some notion of the sound world he
  imagined for <i>Alice</i>. Though he remained opposed to postmodernism, the
  sketches paradoxically suggest a blend of various non-Western and popular
  genres; Ligeti even likened the work to a musical filled with rock- and
  jazz-inspired “hits.” In addition to this lighter, pop-influenced style,
  Ligeti envisioned a kind of nonsensical subversion of traditional tonal
  syntax that recalls Carroll’s linguistic games. His plans are indicative of
  a larger phenomenon in contemporary music that I term “Carrollian
  composition”—a body of recent <i>Alice</i> settings in which composers
  translate Carroll’s literary devices into playful musical techniques.</p>
