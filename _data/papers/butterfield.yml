abstract: |
  <p>“Swing” is generally understood today as the foundational rhythmic property
  of all good jazz, the underlying spark animating the music, drawing listeners
  in, inspiring them to tap their feet, bob their heads, etc. This was not
  always the case, however. Before the 1930s, virtually all writing concerning
  the temporal dimension of jazz and other forms of black music identified
  syncopation and metronomic precision as its distinguishing rhythmic features.
  The word “swing” was widely used as early as the 1870s to refer to a danceable
  rhythmic cadence in music as diverse as Verdi operas, Haydn symphonies, and
  Sousa marches. Its occasional use in reference to ragtime (Scott Joplin in
  1908), Negro spirituals (James Weldon Johnson in 1925), or jazz (Walter
  Kingsley in 1917) did not designate anything unique to black music,
  foundational to its conception, or essential to its performance. This would
  change, however.</p>
  <p>This paper traces the process by which “swing” acquired its modern meaning
  in the mid-1930s. There is evidence the term had entered American jazz
  musicians’ argot by 1933, but no indication they understood it to be a kind of
  foundational rhythmic essence, Duke Ellington’s “It Don’t Mean a Thing”
  notwithstanding—between its premiere in August 1931, its recording in February
  1932, and the widespread popularity it had gained by 1933, it appears that no
  American writing about the song had anything to say about the “swing” of its
  subtitle. Rather, as I demonstrate, this term’s specialized meaning for jazz
  came from the efforts of Hugues Panassié to translate it into French around
  the time of Ellington’s visit to Paris in July 1933. Finding no suitable
  French equivalent, Panassié used “swing” as a technical term, conceptually
  altering an American colloquialism to serve as a critical filter for
  distinguishing true jazz from false. His notion of “swing” was then
  re-integrated into the American understanding by his colleague and friend John
  Hammond, who wrote about it repeatedly in his column for the <i>Brooklyn Daily
  Eagle</i> in the spring of 1935, when he was actively promoting Benny Goodman.
  By year’s end, “what is ‘swing’” would be the question on everyone’s lips.</p>
