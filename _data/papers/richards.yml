title: "The Reversal of Hollywood Norms in Herrmann’s Thematic Writing for <i>Vertigo</i>"

abstract: |
  <p>Composers of the classical Hollywood era (the 1930s through 1950s)
  usually drew on eight-bar prototypes, or “grammatical themes,” for the
  construction of their main thematic material, only rarely adopting the short
  “motto theme” or <i>Fortspinnung</i>-like “discursive theme,” as noted in
  Richards 2016. While Bernard Herrmann figured prominently during this
  period, he reversed these norms in his film music, preferring the more
  modern motto and discursive themes to traditional eight-bar models. Thus,
  grammatical themes take on a marked character in Herrmann, and in his scores
  for Alfred Hitchcock in particular they are strongly correlated with scenes
  of emotional stability. This short talk will discuss how Herrmann’s sparing
  use of grammatical themes in Hitchcock’s <i>Vertigo</i> (1958) highlights
  emotional landmarks in the film, heightening the impact of its
  <i>Tristan</i>-esque love story. </p>
  <p>Because grammatical themes fall into two halves, often emphasized by a
  symmetrical 4+4 grouping, they tend to suggest a feeling of predictability and
  completeness. These qualities lend the themes a structure that is readily
  comprehended, and is arguably even a source of comfort to the viewer, one that
  opposes the run-on quality of discursive themes and the all-too-brief nature
  of motto themes. It is therefore remarkable that the only prominent
  grammatical themes in <i>Vertigo </i>are associated with emotionally positive
  plateaus of the protagonist Scottie in his psychological journey through his
  love of Madeleine, the woman he is investigating. These moments of stability
  are all the more powerful as they are especially marked events in Hitchcock’s
  films, where maintaining suspense is a primary goal throughout.</p>
