abstract: |
    <p>While rock’s Aeolian progression has been described by Biamonte (2010),
    Everett (2009), and Moore (1992), among others, as residing in the Aeolian mode
    as bVI-bVII-i, its conflation with a major-mode interpretation of IV-V-vi and
    the tonal ambiguity that results have not been discussed in any great detail.
    Because rock generally lacks raised leading tones and regularly draws on several
    different modes, a single diatonic collection can be the source of multiple
    tonalities. Tonal ambiguity in the Aeolian progression particularly can arise in
    two ways: 1) when the progression or the phrase in which it occurs lacks an
    initial tonic harmony of either the major or Aeolian mode, and 2) when the
    surrounding passages waver between different tonal centers, usually major and
    Aeolian. When the progression entails such multimodal possibilities, the
    tonality is generally clarified through the melodic structure of the
    progression. More specifically, a particular mode is favored when notes of its
    tonic triad are emphasized by any of several means. In such situations, the
    progression encompasses aspects of more than one mode even when a single mode is
    heard to dominate. Thus, rather than view these ambiguous progressions entirely
    in one mode or another, such an approach aims to characterize their tonal
    fluidity in a way not easily captured by Roman numerals.</p>

    <p>This paper attempts to demonstrate that, while rock’s harmonies
    themselves are often mere triads that are strung together into simple
    repeated loops, hearing tonality in the progressions they form can be an
    engaging, complicated, and fascinating affair.</p>
