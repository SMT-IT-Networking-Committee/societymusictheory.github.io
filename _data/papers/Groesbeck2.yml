abstract: | 
    <p>As one of the first Japanese composers to gain widespread global recognition, Tōru Takemitsu has had an outsize influence on discourse surrounding traditional Japanese music, both in his home country and overseas. Takemitsu’s concept of ma (間 “negative space; silence”) has been particularly influential, and is still widely cited in Anglophone writing. Takemitsu rejected traditional Japanese music for the first several decades of his life, and his eventual embrace of Japanese instruments was largely prompted by European and American scholars, in particular John Cage. However, as detailed by Kōichi Iwabuchi, complicity with Euro-American Orientalist narratives has often been one of the major pathways for Japanese artists to succeed overseas. Furthermore, an essentialist and particularist understanding of Japanese culture may provide Japanese artists themselves with easy answers to the complex problems of globalization, described by Iwabuchi as “self-Orientalism.” Drawing from my experience as a koto performer, I consider how the analytical perspectives inherent in Takemitsu’s ma both align with and diverge from with the values and skills emphasized by my own teachers, referring also to the work of Japanese music theorists such as Fumio Koizumi and Kenji Hirano. By proposing alternatives to ma, I hope to center the center the work of Japanese musicians and scholars deeply engaged with analysis of traditional genres, and point to a more diverse, plurivocal Japanese traditional music theory.</p>
