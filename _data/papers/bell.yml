    <p>In his publication “Die Grenze der Halbtonwelt” (1925), the composer Fritz
    Heinrich Klein introduced his readers to a twelve-tone series containing every
    possible interval between its successive notes, believing this series to be
    the only such example. In the following decades, the question of the
    all-interval twelve-tone series would capture the interest of mathematicians
    and musicians alike as it became apparent that no simple formula could
    generate an exhaustive list of all-interval series.</p>
    <p>I report on the preparation of accurate catalogs of the all-interval
    twelve-tone series with the assistance of digital computers between 1959 and
    1965. The work of Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg and Melvin Ferentz (1965) reports an
    exhaustive catalog; their achievement is perhaps the most well-known such
    solution in the English-speaking musical world. By the time of its
    publication, however, it postdated the complete catalogs of André Riotte (ca.
    1963) in Italy and, together, Hanns Jelinek and Heinz Zemanek (1959) in
    Vienna. I focus on the collaboration between Jelinek, an Austrian composer,
    and his compatriot computer engineer, Zemanek. They prepared the first
    complete catalog in 1959 with the help of <i>Mailüfterl</i>, the first fully
    transistorized computer built in Europe.</p>
    <p>Later public reflections by Zemanek, Krenek, and Riotte articulate a
    conception of music composition as a species of computational information
    processing. A complete history of these music-theoretical catalogs, although
    it straddles the onset of the apparently transformative age of computing,
    reveals the relations between this burgeoning computational attitude toward
    music and older ideas about twentieth-century music theory, composition, and
    mathematics.</p>
