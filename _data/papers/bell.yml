abstract: |
    <p>Tchaikovsky’s virtuosic play with what Harald Krebs (1999) calls
    <i>metrical dissonance</i> is especially pronounced in his music for
    <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> op. 66 and <i>Nutcracker</i> op. 71, both billed as
    <i>ballets-féeries</i>. Following the metaphorical language employed by Frank
    Samarotto (2000), Robert Hatten (2002), and Steve Larson (2012) in their
    responses to Krebs’s work, this paper uses the choreo-musical analysis of
    Tchaikovsky’s music and Marius Petipa’s late-nineteenth-century dances to
    explore how our experience of metrical dissonance meaningfully interacts with
    our perception of physical movement. This perspective brings to the fore an
    aspect of rhythm that is often implicit in analyses of metrical dissonance but
    rarely explicitly addressed: the <i>orientation</i> of interpretive layers
    (what Larson 2012 calls “<i>flow</i>”).

    <p>I demonstrate that Tchaikovsky’s manipulation of metrical dissonance serves
    to 1) develop the “characteristic” rhythmic gestures and <i>latent</i>
    dissonances (Mirka 2009) of established dance types, 2) designate the
    stylistic registers of theatrical dancing (<i>serieux</i>,
    <i>demi-caractère</i>, and <i>comique</i>), and 3) connect individual dances
    together in overarching metrical processes (intensification,
    diminution/augmentation, tightening/loosening, and submerging/surfacing).
    Excerpts to be examined include pantomimed <i>scènes</i> from both works,
    <i>Nutcracker</i>’s Act I <i>valse des flocons de neige</i> and Act II <i>pas
    de deux</i> (solo variations), and <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>’s six fairy
    variations (from the Prologue <i>pas de six</i>). In each case, our perception
    of rhythmic <i>orientation</i> in relation to metrical dissonance helps us to
    more vividly account for the structural, expressive, and embodied
    ramifications of this musical phenomenon.</p>
