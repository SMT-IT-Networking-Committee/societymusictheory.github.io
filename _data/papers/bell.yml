abstract: |
    <p>When it plays a role in musical analysis at all, dance often serves as
    an imaginary enhancement of a primarily musical experience. For instance,
    topical analysis interprets “dance” topoi as sonic cues that invoke the
    memory or specter of courtly dance to expressively animate instrumental or
    vocal music. Even some choreo-musical analyses tend to portray dance as a
    commentary or “visualization” of the score—an auxiliary to the music
    itself. But what would musicians and audiences learn if we were to turn
    this perspective on its head?</p>
    <p>In this talk, I consult the treatises of two influential dance
    theorists—Carlo Blasis (1797–1878) and Fyodor Lopukhov (1886–1973)—to
    reposition the analysis of dance and its musical accompaniment through a
    primarily choreographic lens. While roughly a century separates the two
    authors, both discuss “classical” ballet technique and choreography in
    terms that may seem at once familiar and unsettling to musicians. Through
    examples of standard ballet class exercises and excerpts from
    <i>Giselle</i>, <i>La Bayadère</i>, and <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, I
    highlight instances in which Blasis and Lopukhov have appropriated musical
    concepts and nomenclature (e.g. "adagio," "petit allegro," and even
    "sonata form") to delineate strictly choreographic elements and processes.
    As a foil to established analytical methods, where music recalls or
    contains imagined dances, these two dance theorists offer an appealing
    counterpoint: that choreographed dance contains—and dictates—imagined
    “music.”</p>
