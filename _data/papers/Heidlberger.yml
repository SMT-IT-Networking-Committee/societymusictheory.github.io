abstract: | 
    <p>Anton Reicha’s (1770–1836) music theory is commonly associated with his treatises that were published in Paris between 1814 and 1831. Besides this well-known corpus a considerable number of material exists that represent Reicha’s theoretical thinking of the period before he moved permanently to Paris in 1808. It consists of manuscripts for textbooks on harmony, but also of analytical writings and essays about musical expression and compositional aesthetics as well as “example compositions.” Their significance lies in their innovative and at times radical approach to theoretical aspects, along with an idiosyncratic empirical methodology. Aspects of chromatic modulation, irregular and compound meters, unusual phrasing and methods of motivic development are covered in a way that is very unusual for the time of their origin, around 1800. These aspects define Reicha as a composer and theorist who experimented with compositional features that became mainstream for a later generation of composers, such as his students Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt.</p>
    <p>In my paper I will focus on the “24 Kompositionen für Klavier” that were accompanied by extensive analytical comments, called “Philosophisch-practische Anmerkungen zu den Beispielen.” I will analyze selected examples and contextualize them to show how they represent a theoretic thinking that was ahead of his time. This includes their possible influence on Ludwig van Beethoven’s compositional development.</p>
