title: "Harriet Padberg: Computer-Composed Canon and Free-Fugue Renascence"
handouts: []
abstract: |
    <p>Sister Harriet Padberg’s 1964 dissertation, “Computer-Composed Canon and
    Free-Fugue,” may be the first on computerized algorithmic composition. In this
    work, Padberg combined traditional fugue style and 20th-century serialism with
    a novel text-to-music algorithm contrasting widely-used stochastic methods.
    Padberg's dissertation can be seen today as having pioneered modern
    text-to-music approaches—processing text into features used to define sounds,
    rhythms, and structures which form the basis for composition.</p>
    <p>While the original code is made available in the dissertation, the ability
    to run it, experiment with it, or sonify its outputs is inaccessible; it was
    written for the IBM 1620 and 7072, machines which most likely can only be
    found in museums. The authors have thus recreated the software in Python and
    are releasing it as an open-source, stand-alone program. The purpose of this
    renascence is to allow anyone to use and interact with Padberg’s system,
    providing a window into music technology history and the ability to reimagine
    the system’s potential uses for new work.</p>
    <p>Despite its originality and relevance to the work of more prominent
    algorithmic composition figures such as Lejaren Hiller and Max Matthews,
    Padberg's work remains obscure and rarely referenced. With the exception of
    one survey by Hiller, Padberg’s dissertation is not mentioned in any of
    Hiller's or Mathews’s papers about computer music despite both of them
    communicating with her and learning from her approach. Nevertheless, this
    piece remains a vital example of algorithmic composition research and a
    significant part of the history of early computer music.</p>
