abstract: |
  <p>The premiere of César Franck’s String Quartet in D Major (1890) ushered in
  three decades of renewed interest and experimentation in the genre among a wide
  variety of French composers. Franck’s Quartet presented to these composers a
  new blueprint for the string quartet that shifted the weight of musical meaning
  away from the sonata-form first movement, toward thematic development between
  movements through the use of cyclic form, and an expanded, highly expressive
  slow movement. Vincent d’Indy called this type of slow movement, overflowing
  with Wagnerian “unending melody,” <i>forme lied</i>. Despite this shift in
  musical meaning, however, both historical and recent commentary on Franck’s
  Quartet has focused almost exclusively on the formal processes of the first and
  fourth movements. </p>
  <p>Hidden at the center of Franck’s Quartet, in the second and third movements,
  is a series of striking allusions to two of the most recognizable motives from
  Wagner’s <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>: the <i>Sehnsuchtsmotiv</i> and the opening
  motive of <i>Isoldes Liebestod</i>. In the scherzo-and-trio second movement,
  the <i>Sehnsuchtsmotiv</i> appears in conjunction with the <i>Liebestod</i>
  motive. The light, airy setting of these two motives within the trio
  constitutes one of the earliest parodies of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>,
  predating Debussy’s renowned parody in “Golliwogg’s Cake-Walk” by eighteen
  years. The trio also parodies one of the fundamental characteristics of
  <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>: it completely eschews any kind of cadential closure.
  </p>
  <p>Underneath the parody lies a serious message: Franck’s allusions to the two
  motives enact musically the struggle of composing after <i>Tristan</i>. The
  trio’s first theme, comprised of the two motives, fails as a melody: after
  multiple attempts to turn the motives into a successful melody, which all
  dissolve into silence, Franck simply abandons them and starts again with a new
  melody. In the <i>forme lied</i> third movement, however, Franck successfully
  incorporates the <i>Sehnsuchtsmotiv</i> into the movement’s penultimate
  section, where it precipitates the emotional climax of the movement, and,
  indeed, the quartet as a whole. The <i>Sehnsuchtsmotiv</i> has been assimilated
  into Franck’s compositional voice: it has traversed the gulf from destructive
  influence in the second movement to productive influence in the third
  movement.</p>
