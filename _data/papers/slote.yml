    <p><em>Goyescas,</em> the programmatic suite for solo piano by Enrique Granados, encompasses a love story between <em>maja</em> and <em>majo,</em> stock characters from Castilian folklore. Snippets of fanciful text explaining the story punctuate the score. In the final movement, “Epílogo: Serenate del Espectro,” the <em>majo,</em> who has died, returns in ghostly form to serenade his lover. The music’s structural underpinnings vivify this narrative turn. In its formal and motivic design, “Epílogo” renders the past audible in the musical present by multiple currents of transformation.</p>
    <p>My analysis traces three transformative processes in “Epílogo:” quasi-rotational form and its structural deformation, motivic relationships across different narrative spaces, and the clarification of motivic identity. I first explore how a substantial formal rupture enacts a crossing-over into reminiscence. I then trace how earlier motives foreshadow the reemergence of the musical past. Finally, I identify how certain motives come to be associated with everyday objects, a process of “disenchantment” that retroactively highlights the objects’ bewitchment. My reading draws upon concepts of teleological genesis and rotational form (Hepokoski 1993), voice (Abbate 1991), and temporal fusion (Kaplan 1996).</p>
    <p>“Epílogo” encapsulates <em>Goyescas’</em> contribution to a turn-of-the-century cultural project in which Spanish artists aimed to determine a quintessential national ethos and to represent it through their work. With this project, I aim to contribute to scholarship focused on Spanish art music in the early twentieth century, a repertoire that is less well-represented than others in current music-theoretical discourse.</p>
