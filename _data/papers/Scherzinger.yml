    <p>The talk examines the way some types of sub-Saharan African music—ranging from pre-colonial <em>matepe</em> music from the Korekore region in northern Zimbabwe and <em>amadinda</em> music from the Kampala region in southern Uganda from the era before the destruction of the Lubiri Court—pose a challenge to, if not conceptually <em>invert,</em> the Newtonian-inflected relation of meter (and thereby also rhythm). In contrast to the Euro-industrial conception of it, consolidated in modern Enlightenment era, rhythmic-melodic entities in <em>matepe</em> and <em>amadinda music,</em> (no less than <em>embaire</em>, <em>akadinda, mbira dza vadzimu,</em> and <em>timbila</em> music) often remain stable, while metric schemes are meticulously rotated. This talk describes the systems that undergird their performance practices, demonstrating, for example, how interlocking parts and inherent pattern formations elicit beat entrainment set adrift of the embodied motor patterns of performers, as well as how procedures for pitch transposition further rotate distinct metric schemes, effectively recouping a kind of rhythmic-melodic identity under transformational metric conditions. Instead of merely to relativize Euro-industrial practices of meter (and its attendant rhythm-concept) the talk hopes to Africanize those metric practices that go as universal. This is a study in reimagining a musical formalism, beyond refusal or redemption, to decenter the colonial legacies of musical time.</p>
