  <p>During his brief post at Harvard University, Gustav Holst (1874–1934) began
  indulging in a cappella canons. Upon his return to England in 1932, he
  finished setting his Eight Canons for Equal Voices to some of Helen Waddell’s
  translations of <i>Medieval Latin Lyrics</i>. “Lovely Venus”—dedicated to his Harvard colleague
  Wallace Woodworth and the Radcliffe Choral Society—is unique in this
  collection not only for its construction as an “à 3” stacked canon, but
  additionally for its voices entering at consecutive intervals of descending
  major thirds. This study draws connections among ideas from post-tonal canon
  systems and the extended common practice to codify the interdependence between
  melodic intervals and their generated harmonies, and the macroharmonic
  byproduct that results from such a union.</p>
  <p>Another feature of these canons is that each voice is assigned individual
  key signatures. While his friends implored him to publish these pieces absent
  of any key, Holst believed that they were character-defining features for each
  of these canons. The analytical method applied to a reduction of “Lovely
  Venus” reveals a background structure that navigates through a large portion
  of the hyper-hexatonic system while exhausting a particular cardinal region
  via maximally-smooth voice leading. The notated triple-key combination between
  each voice symbolizes this hexatonic region and the uncanny system that
  inherently results from its restrictions. A foreground-level macroharmonic
  analysis reveals a larger symmetrical set, atypical to associate with this
  composer’s repertoire, that deepens our understanding of Holst’s harmonic
  language during his late compositional phase.</p>
