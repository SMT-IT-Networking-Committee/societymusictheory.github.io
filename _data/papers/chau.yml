  <p>This study uses existing ideas on polytonality and neo-Riemannian theory to
  analyze the smooth “key-leading” relationships within Gustav Holst’s
  <i>Terzetto</i>, written in 1925 for flute, oboe, and viola (or clarinet).
  Neo-Riemannian theory states that major and minor triads can voice lead
  smoothly from one to another and will maintain the [037] trichord structure.
  Analogously, a triad of keys is maximally smooth when two of the three
  diatonic collections stay the same, and the third transposes by perfect fifth
  or perfect fourth. The only triad of keys that can “key lead” to two other
  triads of keys of the same type with maximally smooth motion is the [014]
  tri-key combination. This is expected: semitones and perfect fifths are
  related by the M<sub>7</sub> (multiply-by-7) operation, and [037] and [014] are
  M<sub>7</sub>-transforms of one another.</p>
  <p>The two movements of Holst’s <i>Terzetto</i> take full advantage of the
  potential of this [014] tri-key combination. [014] is the first, the last, and
  the most common type of tri-key combinations in both movements of the
  composition, and the motions between adjacent [014] tri-key combinations are
  often quite smooth, and frequently maximally so. Through modulation of
  diatonic sets in each of the three separate voices in <i>Terzetto</i>, this
  “parsimonious key leading” approach is pertinent to the analysis of triple
  tonality in this composition. This presentation uses a modified <i>Tonnetz</i>
  to visualize how these triple tonalities unfold over time. </p>
