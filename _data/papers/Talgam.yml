abstract: | 
    <p>Unsuk Chin’s six Etudes build on the rhythmic concerns of Ligeti’s Etudes, especially the use of complex metric structures involving polyrhythm and frequent meter changes. The experimental nature of these rhythms creates significant difficulties for performers, especially in cases where the relation between the composer’s metric notation and possible rhythmic perceptions is tenuous.</p>
    <p>I argue that in order to successfully convey the rhythmic organization in performance, it is necessary to disentangle notation from metric perception by considering alternative forms of notation, using existing theories of metric perception. </p>
    <p>I proceed to create a re-notation methodology in two stages. First, I identify rhythmic and grouping cues that create phenomenal accents, using the framework suggested by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983). With this in place, I propose a distinction between radical and conservative listening, following Imbrie’s (1973) phenomenological analysis. In this model, a conservative listener attempts to hold on to the pulse they recognized despite the appearance of contradictory phenomenal accents (in anticipation of its eventual re-alignment with the music), while a radical listener will immediately shift their metric expectation to adjust to these new cues.</p>
    <p>Using this conceptual framework, I examine particularly dense passages in Etudes 2, 5, and 6, offering alternative, though equivalent, re-notations which reflect the metric experience of listeners of both types.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate the influence of re-notation choice on performance strategies from a pianist’s perspective, I will use recorded excerpts of my own performances of the Etudes.</p>
