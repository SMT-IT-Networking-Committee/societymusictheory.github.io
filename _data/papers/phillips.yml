  <p>Among Brahms’s chamber works the Trio for Violin, Natural Horn
  [<i>Waldhorn</i>] and Piano (1865) is celebrated for its unusual scoring and
  distinctive formal design. Yet arguably the most remarkable feature of this
  composition is the singular manner in which it has aged. Contemporary
  reactions to the Horn Trio stressed the “poetic” quality of the
  <i>Waldhorn</i> and, in 1908, Brahms’s biographer Max Kalbeck enthused about
  the trio’s “indescribable acoustic allure.” But most modern assessments of op.
  40 suggest that the work’s timbre has now been divested of its exotically
  antiquated aura. Recontextualizing early reviews, and considering the recorded
  legacy of Brahms’s composition, this paper examines the reception of the Horn
  Trio by charting shifting perceptions of the <i>Waldhorn</i> as sonority and
  signifier. </p>
  <p>Nineteenth-century critics described the affect of Brahms’s trio through
  reference to the literary <i>topos</i> of the Romantic horn call. The tones of
  the <i>Waldhorn</i> dominate the soundscapes of much Romantic poetry and prose
  fiction, and in the novels of Tieck, Eichendorff and Brentano the horn call
  motif is freighted with associations, not just of hunting and nature, but also
  of memory, loss, and longing for the blessed state of childhood. Such ideas
  are germane to the emotional landscape and form of Brahms’s composition. Like
  a Romantic <i>Bildungsroman</i>, the four movements of his trio trace a path
  through extremes of introversion and exuberance, exemplifying the varying
  temporalities connected to the Romantic horn call: the sighs and surges of
  melancholy longing, and the strident, goal-oriented temporality of the
  hunt.</p>
  <p>But while the literary associations of the <i>Waldhorn</i> may be
  recuperated, harder to regain is the peculiarity of the Horn Trio’s timbre as
  it would have struck nineteenth-century listeners. By domesticating the
  <i>Waldhorn</i>, Brahms forged a work subtly subversive to
  mid-nineteenth-century conventions of chamber music. Since then, the timbral
  salience of the Horn Trio has been diluted by developments in historically
  informed performance practice and recording technology. Today, the tones of
  the <i>Waldhorn</i> are readily accessible to listeners, but this very
  accessibility has served to mute the trio’s original cultural resonances.</p>
