abstract: |
  <p>Throughout the nineteenth century, albums—filled with personal inscriptions
  from family and friends—were a locus of socially constructed memory. In this
  paper, I explore the character piece “Erinnerung” from Schumann’s <i>Album für
  die Jugend</i>, op. 68 as a case study of private album-keeping practices
  undertaken by Schumann and his circle as they mourned and remembered their
  recently departed friend Felix Mendelssohn. This published composition stands
  in dialogue with several other private pieces of art and documents created by
  the Schumanns and their close friends, all inspired by Mendelssohn’s death or
  the music of “Erinnerung” itself: album leaves of poetry written by the artist
  Julius Hübner, deathbed sketches of Mendelssohn by Hübner and Eduard Bendemann,
  and records in the Schumanns’ various diaries. After the <i>Album</i> was
  published, “Erinnerung” continued to convey personal meaning, memories, and
  grief only to those familiar with this privately constructed monument.</p>
  <p>Further, I argue that Schumann connected “Erinnerung” musically to three
  other pieces in the <i>Album</i>, the so-called Star Pieces, and that the
  relationships among the four demonstrate ways in which the reflection inspired
  by “Erinnerung” sparked his imagination and fostered new creation, as in
  private albums. I draw on Elaine Sisman’s work on <i>phantasia</i>—which
  discusses the intersection of fantasia-like music, imagination and
  remembering—and Schumann’s own descriptions of his experiences fantasizing at
  the keyboard in order to posit a scenario in which the Star Pieces grew out of
  small musical motives from “Erinnerung.” These small seeds of remembrance both
  represented the past and also grew into something new as Schumann reflected on
  the death of his friend.</p>
  <p>I center my paper on personal objects and experiences in order to open the
  discussion surrounding Romantic memory to include that which goes beyond the
  score and quietly speaks to specific, private memories. Only by viewing
  “Erinnerung” through the lens of album practice—which privileged and
  facilitated the creation of such memories—can we fully begin to appreciate the
  layers of Schumann’s homage, and understand how this piece helped this circle
  of friends remember and grieve Mendelssohn.</p>
