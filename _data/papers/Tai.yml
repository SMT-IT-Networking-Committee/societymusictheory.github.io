    <p>Following the precedent of scholars of musical form, most choreomusicologists (scholars of dance and music) model the form of a dance by asserting discrete sectional boundaries. However, dancers and dance scholars adopt a continuous view of time, space, and motion in dance. This paper proposes that because of this continuity, it is generally difficult to pinpoint precise sectional boundaries in dance, and as a result, dance can respond to the relationship between successive passages of music in creative ways. This phenomenon is especially interesting in neo-classical ballets choreographed to the music of J. S. Bach, since both the music and the dance frequently do not admit tidy sectionalization. Neo-classical ballets are additionally suitable for exploring the question of form because the ballets, being non-narrative, are often commentaries on the music.</p>
    <p>Motivated by these observations, this paper analyzes the second movement of George Balanchine’s <em>Concerto Barocco</em> (1941), choreographed to the second movement of Bach’s <em>Double Violin Concerto</em> (BWV 1043). The music does not lend itself to obvious sectionalization, and the dance at times clarifies, at times complicates where and how formal junctures appear in the music. By using dance to interpret formal aspects of music, this paper helps to balance the more typical practice in choreomusicology where music-analytical methods are adapted to dance, leading to the neglect of minute details that help give dance its expressive meaning.</p>
