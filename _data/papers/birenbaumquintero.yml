abstract: |
  <p>In Colombia, much of the musical production of middle-class, racially
  unmarked musicians revolves around rock and jazz settings of traditional
  Afro-Colombian musical forms, a movement that has been called <i>fusión</i> or
  “the new Colombian music.” This might be understood as a Colombian version of
  familiar processes of racial fantasy and cultural appropriation. </p>
  <p>Certainly, many of the artists and their publics are invested in musical
  representations of blackness (and, in non-musical fields, indigeneity) as a
  means of access to sexuality, spirituality, closeness to nature, and a sense
  of cultural rootedness that are understood as lacking among deracinated
  non-black middle-class urbanites like themselves. Accordingly, many of these
  representations exult in essentializing and orientalizing tropes that, in
  their assignation of mystical humanity to black Colombians, ultimately
  undermine their human individuality and particularity. </p>
  <p>But on the other hand, the mainstream embrace of musical blackness can be
  thought of as a rethinking of the dynamics of <i>mestizaje</i>, the
  nationalist ideology of cultural and racial mixture. <i>Mestizaje</i> has
  often been critiqued as an ideology of whitening, which posited black and
  indigenous Colombians as peripheral aspirants to a universalizing form of
  cultural whiteness. But <i>mestizaje</i>, as recognized by the Afro-Colombian
  intellectual Manuel Zapata Olivella, can also be understood as a recognition
  of the non-white ancestry and cultural heritage of Colombia’s unmarked
  white-mestizo racial category, thus transforming <i>mestizaje</i> from an
  ideology of racial exclusion to a radical reevaluation of blackness and
  indigeneity that folds them into the very heart of Colombians’
  self-conception. </p>
  <p>And yet, even this project in solidarity can be undermined when non-black
  musicians are unreflexive about the privileges afforded by their own
  non-blackness and even compete with black Colombian musicians for musical
  gigs, or through musical partnerships that may or may not put black and
  non-black musicians on equal footing.</p>
  <p>Relying on interviews and musical texts, this presentation explores the
  ethical twists and turns that underwrite non-black musicians’ and audiences’
  relationship with black musical forms and musicians, and black musicians’
  negotiations of this environment, in the new Colombian music.</p>
