title: "Precept and Protest: A Brief History of Brevity in Music Theory of the German Reformation"

abstract: |
  <p>Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it is also the lifeblood of music
  theory, a body of literature coursing with paraphrases, primers, rules, and
  rubrics. Yet this constant flow of music-theoretic breviloquence often evades
  historiographical attention; instead, the congealed learning of lengthy tomes
  tends to command scholarly examination. My talk therefore proposes an example
  both little and little known but at one time extraordinarily ordinary, namely
  Heinrich Faber’s 1548 <i>Compendiolum musicae pro incipientibus</i> (“Little
  Compendium of Music for Beginners”), probably the most widely used
  <i>Lateinschule </i>music text. To account for its remarkable circulation, I
  tug on a red thread binding music pedagogy of the German Reformation from
  Fulda to Faber: recurring emphasis on the ancient oratorical desideratum of
  <i>brevitas</i>. By systematically shrinking the work of his predecessors,
  Faber thus beat them at their own language game, the name of the game being
  “brevity.” Yet the <i>Compendiolum</i> is little not only literally but
  literarily; its subject matter is basic and its prose style simple,
  catechizing precepts of music literacy in a singsong question-and-answer game
  for little children. To illustrate, my talk premieres the first complete
  English translation of the <i>Compendiolum</i>, supplemented by a live
  teaching demo showing how schoolmasters thereby indoctrinated their young
  pupils. Closing with a theopolitical turn, I follow Cristle Collins Judd in
  citing music-theoretic abbreviation as a soft weapon of sectarian conflict,
  inviting reflection on how subtle instruments of protest not only defined the
  confessional age but shaped—and sized—our own.  </p>
