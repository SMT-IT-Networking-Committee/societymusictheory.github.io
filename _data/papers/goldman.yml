  <p>One way to resolve the paradox of improvisation’s simultaneous freedom and
  constraint is to posit a continuum connecting the polar extremes of
  predetermination and absolute indeterminacy—but this does not account for the
  many ways in which a performer can improvise. It is important to consider
  different types of improvisatory processes. For example, the performance
  practice of live coding—in which performers write and execute algorithms in
  real time—exemplifies a distinction between "propositional" and "embodied"
  improvisation. Live coding is propositional improvisation in that the
  performer’s physical actions are temporally dissociated from the resultant
  sounds, the relationship between movement and sound is not systematic (i.e.,
  not one-to-one), and performers make decisions at discrete points in time.
  Embodied improvisation, by contrast, links movement and sound in real-time,
  with systematic feedback, whereby decisions can be made continuously.</p>
  <p>Experimental work can support this typological distinction. Electronic
  instruments can vary the temporal synchrony and systematicity of the auditory
  feedback, providing for propositional and embodied performance conditions.
  Neural and behavioral measures under the different conditions can demonstrate
  differences in the products and processes of types of improvisation. An irony
  is that this propositional-embodied distinction can itself be described as a
  continuum, considering the continuity of the neural and behavioral measures
  used to identify it, and that instruments vary in the characteristics of their
  embodied interfaces. Continua have a role in theorizing improvisatory
  processes, but they strongly depend on the fixity of their poles, and there
  are certainly more than two poles of musical performance process.</p>
