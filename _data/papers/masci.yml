abstract: |
  <p>In July 1853, Fétis reviewed Augustin Savard’s <i>Cours complet
  d’harmonie théorique et pratique </i>for the <i>Revue et gazette musicale.</i>
  The latest text officially adopted for the harmony course at the Paris
  Conservatory, Fétis criticized the work for its lack of principles and
  overabundant examples: “Of all the works adopted by the Conservatory, only
  those of Catel and Reicha pose actual theories; the rest are simply methods,”
  adding, “I, after all, never submitted my theory for approval by the
  Conservatory.” In addition to drawing a generic distinction between
  theoretical and practical texts, Fétis’s comments point to an important,
  overlooked fact in the history of nineteenth-century music theory: namely,
  Fétis’s grand <i>Traité complet </i>with its theory of <i>tonalité</i> was
  never adopted or used at the Conservatory. Indeed, many Conservatory texts
  attest, down to their very typography, to the equivocal status that tonal
  theory occupied within the discipline of harmony. In outlining tonal
  principles, for instance, Savard’s <i>Cours</i> relies on three different
  sized fonts to indicate the relative value of each proposition to the
  practical studies of keyboard harmony and composition, literally reducing and
  highly circumscribing the role of tonal principles within his text. Taking
  Savard’s work as a point of departure, this paper examines the various ways in
  which Conservatory texts redact notions of <i>tonalité</i>. I suggest that
  tonal theory acts as a generic marker of certain types of theory texts rather
  than an essential feature of practical harmony study, and consider the
  implications of this for our broader histories of tonal theory.</p>
