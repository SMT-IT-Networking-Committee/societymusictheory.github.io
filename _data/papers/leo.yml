    <p>When comparing musical works in a federal copyright lawsuit, putative similarities between original elements of each work are often legally treated as more indicative of copying. In cases heard since the mid-nineteenth century, such emphasis on originality has led to case outcomes that hinge on melocentric comparisons. Although often necessary, bass line melodies and chord progressions instead serve a more contextual role, being legally treated as unoriginal, and thus unprotectable, musical building blocks. Yet in some cases, these elements have proven critical to defining the essence of a copyrightable work or the musical style of its creator(s). Balancing these seemingly opposite interests raises a perennial question in music copyright: can a chord progression be copyright protected?</p>
    <p>Contemporary lawsuits have presented circumstances in which chord progressions might constitute copyrightable subject matter. After a gloss of federal copyright jurisprudence surrounding the contours of similarity analysis, this presentation surveys available court records from cases in which chord progressions became a significant point of forensic comparison as conducted by musical expert witnesses. For most of the twentieth century, judges presiding over such cases dispensed with harmonic discourse, instead determining legal outcomes based on melodic and formal grounds. Yet in two more recent cases, chord progressions have been considered legally original enough to be copyright protectable. In <em>Tempo Music v. Famous Music Corp</em> (1994), the Billy Strayhorn estate successfully staked claim to earlier copyright registrations for the Ellington Orchestra standard, “Satin Doll,” based on Strayhorn’s contribution of the song's distinctive chord progression. Although still on appeal, in <em>Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin</em> (2018), a chord progression could be considered original when analyzed in the context of its bass line. In both cases, forensic musicological analysis prepared by experts provided critical evidence to separating original melodic and chordal elements from unoriginal harmonic practices. </p>
    <p>Through its interdisciplinary investigation, this presentation emphasizes the subjective nature of copyright infringement and the impact that originality of chord progressions can have on assessments of similarity and copyrightability. In so doing, it highlights the evolving nature of music copyright and the significance of forensic musicology on analysis of music as intellectual property.</p>
