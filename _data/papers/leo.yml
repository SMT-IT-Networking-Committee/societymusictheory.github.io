Current Federal Copyright Litigation"

abstract: |
    <p>Musical similarity in federal copyright lawsuits is analyzed first by
    expert witnesses, followed by non-expert factfinders, either judges or
    jurors. Although the legal scope of their assessments is different, both
    groups must compare tangible copies of the songs at issue: either sheet
    music filed with the U.S. Copyright Office as a deposit copy; or
    recordings and transcriptions of them, produced by experts for the purpose
    of litigation. For music copyrighted prior to the enactment of the 1976
    Copyright Act, sheet music served as the primary representation of a song
    as intellectual property. Although written notation ostensibly promises
    legal documentation, for music created first on record, deposit copies are
    often de facto lead sheets that merely outline more complex compositions.
    If these songs are later implicated in copyright lawsuits, what source
    should serve as the point of musical-legal comparison: the deposit copy or
    the recording?</p>
    <p>This question has emerged in three current federal copyright lawsuits:
    Williams v. Bridgeport Music, over the songs “Blurred Lines” and “Got To
    Give It Up”; Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin, over the songs “Taurus” and
    “Stairway to Heaven”; and Griffin v. Sheeran, over the songs “Let’s Get It
    On” and “Thinking Out Loud.” After a gloss of legislative discrepancies
    between the 1909 and 1976 Copyright Acts and relevant judicial
    decision-making processes, this presentation examines court records and
    compares examples from these cases to model the ontological problematics
    of musical-legal analysis. In so doing, it highlights the critical, and
    public, role of musical analysis in federal copyright law.</p>
