title: "Courtroom Musicology: Forensic Similarity Analysis in Contemporary American Copyright Litigation"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>A perennial problem in American copyright law is how, and by whom, musical
  similarity should be evaluated. Since the first infringement lawsuits heard in
  the mid-nineteenth century, courts have turned to detailed musical analyses
  produced by expert witnesses. But since the mid-twentieth century, evolving
  legal criteria have progressively limited the scope and application of such
  analyses in the decision-making process. Contemporary experts, either academic
  or forensic musicologists, may only offer systematic “dissections” and
  comparisons in accordance with legal notions of objectivity, which are
  intended to inform the subjective, yet dispositive, perceptions of non-expert
  factfinders, either judges or jurors. How have these experts understood their
  role and what issues have they encountered?</p>
  <p>This paper explores available court records from recent music copyright
  litigation to investigate the methods, issues, and influence of expert
  similarity analysis. In their reports and testimony, experts have established
  that analyses should be ostensibly unbiased and emphasize relevant points of
  similarity, and dissimilarity, for factfinders. These evaluations are limited
  by the claims of each lawsuit and typically involve one of two approaches:
    computer-driven appraisals, endorsed by acoustics specialists and often
    applied in digital sampling cases; and melocentric reductive techniques used
    since the mid-twentieth century that legal professionals have recently
    referred to as “standard musicological procedure.” While each approach
    produces different data for factfinders, both have proven to be influential
    on trial outcomes. Abstract theoretical descriptions of music, adversarial
    questions posed by partial attorneys, and contradictory analyses from
    experts hired by opposing parties, however, can cause factfinder skepticism
    or confusion, resulting in decisions that seem to discount expert
    contributions.</p>
  <p>Through a multidisciplinary reading of expert testimony, this paper sheds
  light on the courtroom as a public space for the reception of musical
  analysis. It identifies factfinders tasked with determining infringement as
  stakeholders in such analyses alongside the parties in each case. In so doing,
  this paper responds to, and amplifies, scholarly calls for a coherent model of
  forensic musicology that might better contribute to the resolution of future
  copyright litigation.</p>
