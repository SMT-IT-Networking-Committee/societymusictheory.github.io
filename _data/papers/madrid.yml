  <p>Mexican composer and theorist Julián Carrillo (1875–1965) is best known for
  his so-called <i>El Sonido 13</i> [The Thirteenth Sound], one of the earliest
  theorizations about microtones in the Western art music tradition. Sonido 13,
  as a metaphor for sounds beyond the 12 ET chromatic gamut, is mostly concerned
  with pitch and pitch organization; nevertheless, Carrillo also claimed that
  his microtonal theorizations had revolutionary implications in terms of rhythm
  and the rhythmic organization of music. In his 1925 article, “Problemas del
  Sonido 13” [Problems of the Thirteenth Sound], Carrillo argued that although
  rhythmic symmetry in tonal music was an enormous martyrdom (“¡Que enorme
  martirio la simetría!”) Sonido 13 could put an end to it. However, the
  composer was never very explicit about what those rhythmic implications may
  be. The unique metric and rhythmic complexities featured in Carrillo’s String
  Quartets nos. 4 (1932) and 5 (1937), with their almost chaotic polymetric and
  polytemporal sections, provide a glimpse into the composer’s frame of mind
  regarding rhythm; they also provide a possible answer as to what he believed
  the rhythmic implications of Sonido 13 might be. However, the lack of
  precision in the composer’s notation also leaves the door wide open to a
  variety of interpretations regarding some of the more rhythmically and
  metrically challenging sections in these two works. In this paper, I argue
  that by thinking about instances of metric modulation one can make sense of
  some of the most seemingly chaotic moments in these two compositions by Julián
  Carrillo.</p>
