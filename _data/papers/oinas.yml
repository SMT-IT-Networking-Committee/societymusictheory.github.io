  <p>At a concert held in 2012 at <i>Cité de la musique</i> in Paris, the
  composer György Kurtág and his wife Márta play works from <i>Játékok</i>. The
  performance offers a beautiful example of two musicians sharing the same
  keyboard in a sensitive and appreciative way. For instance, when the Kurtágs
  are playing one of the briefest pieces, “Flowers We Are . . . (Embracing
  Sounds),” the fragility of the moment is created by intimate, physically
  adjacent coordination. Indeed, it seems that inside the great hall, the couple
  is creating their own safe space where the hands will meet and touch—sometimes
  on, other times off the keyboard.</p>
  <p>This paper combines the more recent performance research as suggested for
  example by Nicholas Cook (2013) and a performance-based music analysis (Rink
  2002, Rothstein 2005, Leong and Korevaar 2005). I will examine two four-handed
  piano works by Kurtág, “Flowers We Are . . .”<i> </i>and “Beating—Quarreling.”
  More precisely, I am interested in how Kurtág’s distribution of primo and
  secondo in his four-handed works—sometimes in a highly unorthodox way—creates
  a private space for the pianists, mostly excluding the audience who almost
  have the role of a <i>Voyeur</i> (see Daub 2014).</p>
  <p>By flexibly navigating between performance research and music analysis we
  are also able to acquire a holistic view on the piano duets, a genre that
  until recently has not been extensively studied from a performative point of
  view.</p>
