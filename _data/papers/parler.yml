abstract: |
  <p>Developed by east Texas musicians in the 1930s, western swing sits uneasily
  within popular music historiography. Absent from most histories of jazz,
  western swing more often appears as a subgenre in surveys of country music.
  However, recent western swing historians have advocated for the jazz label,
  documenting the music’s stylistic indebtedness to contemporaneous jazz
  performers via comparative analyses and musician testimonies. Despite
  convincing evidence, these revisionist efforts have yet to turn the
  historiographic tide. At first blush, racial politics seems to offer a ready
  explanation—while jazz is typically identified as an African American genre,
  most 1930s western swing musicians were white. Yet histories of 1930s jazz
  routinely cite the contributions of white bandleaders. Race alone is thus
  insufficient to explain the exclusion of western swing from the jazz canon.</p>
  <p>In grappling with these contradictions of genre, this paper argues for the
  critical role of white, working-class performance venues in the early coding of
  western swing as a non-jazz music. I focus on the Crystal Springs Dance
  Pavilion in Fort Worth, Texas, the primary venue for white western swing
  pioneers Milton Brown and His Musical Brownies. Drawing upon archival
  interviews, newspaper accounts, and government documents, I reconstruct the
  class and racial politics at Crystal Springs and contextualize the venue within
  the broader cultural geography of 1930s Fort Worth. While management enforced
  Jim Crow segregation, the venue also gained notoriety for flouting Prohibition
  laws and attracting outlaw patrons like Bonnie and Clyde. This raucous
  atmosphere alienated middle-class whites who were otherwise receptive to jazz.
  They found their tastes were better served by the city’s burgeoning social
  clubs and mainstream jazz venues, featuring national stars like Paul Whiteman,
  while black audiences were limited to segregated venues like the Jim Hotel. In
  uncovering this history, this paper contributes to local histories of popular
  music, adding to the literature on landmark venues and showing how cultural
  geography and demographics in Fort Worth helped to shape national narratives
  around jazz, country, and western swing.</p>
