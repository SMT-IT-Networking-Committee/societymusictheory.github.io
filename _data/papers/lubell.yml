  <p>Pink Floyd’s <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> (1973), in its original
  long-playing phonographic format, constitutes a complete and physically fixed
  sonic experience. Its running order, stereophonic mixing, and meticulously
  sculpted timbral and spatial markers create a complex lattice of referents
  that lend cohesion and meaning to the album’s large-scale structure. A useful
  framework for understanding the<i> </i>spatial content and development<i>
  </i>of <i>Dark Side </i>can be found in the field of urban planning and the
  associated practice of soundscaping, as popularized by R. Murray Schafer.
  Borrowing from soundscaping’s methodologies, and in acknowledgement of Pink
  Floyd’s aesthetic and experiential priorities, I have applied a
  space/sound-centric approach to the formal analysis of <i>Dark Side</i>. The
  band’s ubiquitous sonic presence establishes a gestalt acoustic environment
  that is spatially predictable and supplies the main harmonic, melodic, and
  rhythmic material of the album. Their sound serves as a spatial/sonic
  foundation or infrastructure, supporting the action from moment to moment and
  creating a global sense of place. Within this environment, other distinct
  sonic actors render senses of place with a higher degree of precision and
  encourage more refined geospatial interpretations. Additional contributors of
  spatial dynamism, afforded by studio technology, further engage the listener’s
  sense of orientation and problematize its interpretation. These physical,
  perceptual, and technological elements contribute to a listening experience
  organized and directed by the album’s objective properties, but also made
  subjective and personal via aural byways extending well beyond those pressed
  in vinyl.</p>
