abstract: |
  <p>In 1773 a violent earthquake disturbed the colonial capital of Santiago de
  Guatemala. Accustomed to seismic activity, locals fully expected to rebuild
  their city once again. Royal officials, however, immediately mandated its
  relocation a day’s journey north to its current day location. The earthquake
  came at a time during which the Bourbon kings sought to reinvigorate the
  Spanish empire through a reconsolidation of monarchical power in the colonies.
  The relocation became a way to drastically diminish the influence civic and
  ecclesiastical authorities wielded over colonial administrative affairs. In
  the old capital a resistance movement formed, led by Guatemala’s archbishop,
  Pedro Cortés y Larraz, who, along with his <i>capilla</i> of musicians,
  ignored orders to relocate until threatened with imprisonment in 1779. During
  this period of conflict, the continued performance of liturgical rituals in
  provisional spaces and within the ruined nave of the old cathedral further
  aggravated the clash between local and royal powers over the legitimacy of the
  new capital. Despite impoverished conditions and aggressive political tactics,
  the cathedral’s maestro de capilla, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, remained
  active in his performance and composing duties, which were shaped in ways both
  subtle and profound by the earthquake. His work, I argue, is best understood
  through the lens of disaster studies: not only does it reveal the influence of
  disaster on genre and style, it shows how musical evidence can sometimes
  illuminate historical moments more vividly than written sources.</p>
  <p>In the midst of the earthquake, a student of Castellanos rescued the music
  from the Catedral de Santiago. This paper draws on those manuscripts, now
  housed in the Archivo Histórico Arquidiocesano de Guatemala, along with
  Castellano’s subsequent compositions and a collection of his papers. In
  turning to musical life in Santiago de Guatemala, I build on the scholarship
  of Alfred Lemmon, Dieter Lehnhoff, and Robert Stevenson, whose initial forays
  into colonial music in Guatemala opened up a series of questions that remain
  unanswered and underexplored today. Along with detailing the intricacies of
  Castellanos’s colonial earthquake repertoire, this paper explores the broader
  implications of doing disaster studies within the field of musicology.</p>
