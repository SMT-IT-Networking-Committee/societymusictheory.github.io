  <p>Musicologists have mostly described late-fifteenth-century Italian song as
  a courtly phenomenon, but the reach of this repertory was much richer and
  wider than the few key courts routinely mentioned in the literature. In this
  paper I examine a few aspects of the dissemination of song in the Veneto as a
  contribution towards a more inclusive definition, one that emphasizes the
  repertory’s cultivation among more socially and geographically diverse
  audiences and contributes to a revision of its origins.</p>
  <p>As William Prizer and others have demonstrated, the Italian song (routinely
  referred to as <i>frottola</i>) had its roots in the unwritten tradition, but
  this fact never brought about a thorough exploration of its social
  consequences. Also, the field’s understanding of historical improvisation has
  been severely limited until recently, to the point that no analytical tools
  were available to scholars to make sense or certain of its stylistic aspects.
  These limitations have made it difficult to perceive the diversity of a
  repertory whose stylistic range spans from pieces evidently linked to the
  vernacular tradition to compositions more obviously aspiring to art-music
  dignity. While the Veneto had no dynastic courts, it hosted a thriving song
  scene, in which musical performances probably took place in a number of venues
  ranging from squares and outdoor locations to private houses and even
  cathedral schools. As part of the evidence for non-courtly song, I will review
  musical sources such as VenBN 10653–6, ModE F.9.9, and the MilT 55, consider
  the respectable number of secular composers trained in Veneto, and describe
  architectural remains such as the famous Odeo Cornaro.</p>
  <p>I would like this paper and the others in the same session to encourage
  musicologists to definitively abandon the concept of frottola as a unified
  courtly repertory and to engage in a fresh investigation on Italian songs,
  meant to return them to the rich complexity of contexts and origins that
  predated the memorialization carried out in the Petrucci workshop.</p>
