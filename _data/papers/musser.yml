title: "Making History: the Politics of Linton Kwesi Johnson’s Dub Poetry"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Jamaican émigré Linton Kwesi Johnson is a giant in the history of black
  British poetry—a “godfather,” in Burt Caesar’s words (1996). Almost
  single-handedly, he innovated dub poetry, a written and spoken form that
  incorporates dub bass rhythms and the syncopated licks of reggae into verse.
  From his position in the literary avant-garde, Johnson transferred such “sound
  writing” into musical performance in the mid-1970s: first, in community
  spaces, with drumming ensemble Rasta Love, and later, in popular culture, with
  Dennis Bovell’s Dub Band, with whom Johnson released numerous LPs, toured
  Europe, and topped the charts in <i>Sounds</i>, <i>Melody Maker</i>, and other
  periodicals (Kapchan 2017).</p>
  <p>Johnson’s activities were not solely literary or musical, however. For him,
  dub poetry was integrally tied to grassroots struggle, locally, and to the
  Third World project and its legacy, globally (Prashad 2007). Drawing on
  archival research, this paper demonstrates the ways Johnson put this program
  into practice. I begin by situating Johnson’s work—specifically the recording,
  “Five Nights of Bleeding”—in the context of his participation in the Caribbean
  Artists Movement. There, he met Edward Kamau Brathwaite, whose “nation
  language” idea guided Johnson’s conception of how verse composed in
  <i>patois</i> could become musical. In this way, dub poetry parallels the work
  of contemporaneous black poets in New York and Paris interested in jazz
  (Edwards 2017). Second, and more extensively, I show how Johnson’s
  <i>oeuvre</i> both documented and instigated the activism of community
  organizations where he worked, including the Railton Youth Club, the Keskidee
  Centre, and the Race Today Collective. Johnson routinely mobilized his growing
  celebrity to draw attention to these institutions; by participating in them,
  he helped <i>make</i> the history he also chronicled in albums like, well,
  <i>Making History</i>. This recursive dynamic, I argue, forces us to
  reevaluate standard narratives of British popular music and politics, which
  are dominated by punk and events like Rock Against Racism (Goodyer 2009).
  Contrastingly, Johnson followed his mentor, C.L.R. James, by developing a
  Marxian, decolonial aesthetics that merged elite and popular art-worlds, and
  furnished black liberation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Thatcher’s New Right.</p>
