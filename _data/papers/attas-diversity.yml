    <p>Music theory instructors may feel compelled to consider diversity in
    the classroom for personal reasons or because of departmental or
    institutional initiatives. They may also be motivated by broader
    educational trends both inside and outside music theory. For instance, the
    field of music theory continues to engage in discussions about curricular
    reform. Further, as public funding for elementary and high school music
    education is an ongoing struggle, incoming music majors may not have the
    skills once assumed to be basic. Finally, many universities in North
    America and Europe are recruiting increasing numbers of international
    students and improving access to education for equity-seeking groups. All
    of these trends may change the typical student abilities and worldviews
    that instructors encounter in their classrooms, necessitating an increased
    attention to diversity in music theory pedagogy.</p>
    <p>This paper will define diversity broadly in order to propose a range of
    practical and concrete actions. A discussion of general principles of
    inclusivity, equity, diversity, and universal design for learning will
    lead to applications in a range of teaching situations where an attention
    to diversity can impact classroom teaching, including classroom dynamics,
    instructional strategies, course content, assessment, and course design.
    The paper will conclude with a list of practical strategies for
    instructors in diverse institutional contexts and career stages.
    Ultimately, this paper advocates for an increased sense of humanity in the
    classroom; that is, for instructors and students alike to see and
    celebrate the diversity of human beings learning alongside one
    another.</p>
