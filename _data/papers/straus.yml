abstract: |
    <p>People identified as “idiot savants” are generally considered “mentally deficient,” while simultaneously demonstrating impressive skill in some area (often music). The savant skill is often understood as a mark of genius, within the familiar trope that likens the Romantic genius to a mere vessel through whom divine inspiration passes. The ascription of genius <em>enfreaks</em> these musicians as simultaneously more and less than human: their superhuman gifts deepen, by contrast, the abjectness of their subhuman mental capacities.</p>
    <p>The coveted, valorizing label “genius” has been often been denied to groups of people on the basis of race, gender, and other systems of oppression. For the musicians discussed in this paper, however, the label has been foisted upon them, and not to their benefit. Rather, it has removed them from the human community (as superhuman) and deepened the stigma of their intellectual disability (as subhuman). By disenchanting the idea of genius and stripping away the savant label, we will be able to see these musicians for what they are: autistic people whose autism enables their distinctive ways of making music. I will pursue my argument by sympathetic evaluation of the musical careers of three musicians who have been widely identified as idiot savants, and whose savant skills have been understood as marks of musical genius: Thomas Wiggins (“Blind Tom”), Leslie Lemke, and Derek Paravicini.</p>
