title: "Music Theory’s Therapeutic Imperative and the Tyranny of the Normal"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Traditional music theory rationalizes abnormal musical elements (like
    dissonant or chromatic tones or formal anomalies) with respect to normal
    ones. It is thus allied with a medical model of disability, understood as
    a deficit or defect located within an individual body, and requiring
    remediation or cure. A newer sociocultural model of disability understands
    it as a culturally stigmatized deviance from normative standards for
    bodily appearance and functioning, analogous to (and intersectional with)
    race, gender, and sexuality as a source of affirmative political and
    cultural identity. The sociocultural model of disability suggests the
    possibility of a disablist music theory, one that subverts the traditional
    therapeutic imperative and resists the tyranny of the normal. Disablist
    music theory is music theory without norms, and without a commitment to
    wholeness, unity, coherence, and completeness—those fantasies of a normal,
    healthy body. Instead, disablist theory brings the seemingly anomalous
    event to the center of the discussion and revels in the commotion and
    discombobulation that result: it makes the normal strange. In the process,
    it opens up our sense of what music theory is and might be.</p>
