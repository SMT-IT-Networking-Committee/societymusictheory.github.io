    <p>The ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Toni Morrison (1931–2019) provides an apt occasion to reconsider the Nobel Prize-winning author’s most substantial contribution to music, namely her libretto for Richard Danielpour’s opera <em>Margaret Garner</em> (2005). Morrison’s libretto is based on the same real-life story that inspired her novel <em>Beloved</em>. Margaret Garner was a slave who escaped with her family from Kentucky to Ohio in 1856. When the group was recaptured, Margaret killed her daughter rather than see the child returned to slavery. </p>
    <p>Throughout the two acts of <em>Margaret Garner</em>, Morrison’s words depicting the harrowing experiences of the slaves are set by Danielpour using octatonic collections [0,1] and/or [2,3], thus establishing a connection between these pitch collections and the institution of slavery and the toxic masculinity of the antihero, slaveowner Edward Gaines. By contrast, when Gaines seeks escape in youthful memories or when the slaves seek escape in a joyful harvest celebration, all traces of octatonicism are purged in favor of pitches from various diatonic and pentatonic collections. The octatonic and diatonic/pentatonic collections are jarringly opposed in several other pivotal dramatic scenes, with Margaret finally choosing death and freedom (represented by the white-key diatonic collection) over continued life in slavery.</p>
    <p>The historical record is remarkably silent about the thoughts and sentiments of the real Margaret Garner. In examining the musical language of freedom and oppression in Danielpour and Morrison’s opera, I aim to illuminate the ways in which they have given voice to an unsung heroine.</p>
