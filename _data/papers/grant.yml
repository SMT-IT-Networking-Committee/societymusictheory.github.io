    <p>This paper examines the teaching of music theory in eighteenth-century Jesuit missions among the Chiquitano indigenous people. Located in what was then the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru––now eastern Bolivia––rural Jesuit missions fostered vibrant communities of choral and orchestral performance. Archival sources suggest ample evidence of robust collaboration between the Jesuit colonizers and the Chiquitano, with operas and liturgical compositions attributed exclusively to indigenous composers. The scant scholarship that exists on this unusual body of repertoire has celebrated its exceptional status; scholars point to the music making preserved in these archives as proof of an isolated set of instances in which the traditional power hierarchies between Jesuit colonizers and indigenous colonized were unstable, and the musical abilities of the native South American population made true exchange and cooperation possible. But if the Chiquitano brought excellent musical aptitudes with them into the eighteenth-century missions, what did they experience when they had to unlearn their own traditions and master European musical performance and music theory? Drawing on and slightly modifying Brian Larkin’s notion of the “colonial sublime,” I suggest that mission music theory pedagogy was not primarily a scene of exchange but rather of colonial seduction. With reference to theoretical works related to solfège in particular, I hope to underscore the role of Western music theory pedagogy in colonial techniques of interpolation. Finally, I aim to draw critical attention to our evolving understandings of hybridity and exchange in the imperialist project of Western music theory pedagogy.</p>
