abstract: |
    <p>Few of Schubert’s evocative compositional moments have attracted more
    attention than the G-flat trill at the start of the D. 960. The trill
    first interrupts the primary theme by emphasizing a chromatic pitch
    through texture, rhythm, dynamics, and register. Its disruptive nature has
    led many authors to turn to narrative explanations when accounting for it.
    Fisk (2001) and Pesic (1999), for instance, personify the piece as a
    wanderer that journeys through the exposition’s large-scale harmonic
    plan—the trill portending the protagonist’s banishment into the second
    tonal area’s (2TA’s) F-sharp minor tonality similarly to Edward T. Cone’s
    promissory note.</p>
    <p>Though the trill is not exactly a promissory note, Fisk and Pesic’s
    narrative demonstrates that hearing certain tonal events of the exposition
    as arising from an initial portentous event can offer a compelling way to
    understand an exposition’s trajectory. Authors commonly invoke such
    foreshadowing narratives in readings of Schubert’s music, particularly his
    songs. Despite this, only a few scholars have explored the role of
    foreshadowing devices in Schubert’s three-key expositions, and of those,
    all have focused on explaining the generically unexpected key of the
    2TA.</p>
    <p>Foreshadowing strategies and their concomitant narratives, however, can
    effectively shape our hearings of many of Schubert’s three-key expositions
    in far more varied ways than simply explaining 2TAs. This talk will use D.
    814/i and D. 537/iii to demonstrate two such instances. In doing so, my
    hope is to begin illuminating the range of narrative possibilities
    inherent in these expositional structures.</p>
