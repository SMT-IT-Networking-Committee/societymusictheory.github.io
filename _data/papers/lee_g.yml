    <p>Davin Lewin’s “Phenomenology” article (1986) has recently been explored
    from the perspectives of both Husserlian and post-Husserlian phenomenologies.
    In the article, Lewin proposed a “p-model,” comprising a series of percepts or
    “p”s: events within perception-contexts of overlapping musical measures. Each
    “p” is recursive in that it modifies other “p”s and also implicates measures
    both before and after the defined perception-context. “Phenomenology” is
    peculiar because of the author’s extended postlude of 35 pages, which is
    longer than the 31-page exegesis of the p-model itself.</p>
    <p>The creation of the extended postlude stems from Lewin’s anxiety over
    musical embodiment, leading to restless, reflexive self-critiques which I
    theorize as queer “bifurcations.” “Bifurcation” refers to the emergence of new
    qualities in a dynamic system (Massumi 1995), which in cultural contexts
    refers to the relentless emergence of new trends, or in the context of music
    theory, the emergence of new points of view. Bifurcation is queer because new
    points of view bring about phenomenological moments of embodied disorientation
    (Ahmed 2006), just as the miller’s song is tonally disoriented in the central
    passage from <i>Morgengruss,</i> from which the p-model was developed from.
    “Phenomenology” is queer because of the concentration of a series of
    bifurcations that can be discerned within the space of one article,
    exemplifying a non-normative impulse that contemporary systemic music theory
    can benefit from.</p>
