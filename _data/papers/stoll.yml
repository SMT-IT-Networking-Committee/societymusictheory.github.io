abstract: |
  <p>Following the assassination of Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines (1758–1806),
  the newly independent Haiti was split in two: to the south, a republic led by
  Alexandre Pétion (1770–1818), a Paris-educated “quadroon” (one-quarter black);
  and, to the north, a monarchy ruled by Henry Christophe (1767–1820), a former
  slave. As king of the Royaume d’Hayti, Christophe set about making Cap-Haïtien
  a cultural capital, constructing the Sans-Souci Palace (1813) and Citadelle
  Laferrière (1805–20), establishing ties with the British, founding an academy
  of music and of art, and appointing a retinue of princes, dukes, knights, and
  counts. Among these was the Comte des Rosiers—born in 1766 as Juste
  Chanlatte—an early Haitian man of letters who, during his Christophean stint,
  authored a corpus of books, poems, hymns, and libretti for the printing
  presses of Sans-Souci. </p>
  <p>Here, I propose a hearing of King Henry I’s royal chambers through two
  operas written by Chanlatte and performed by Haitian homegrown talent:
  <i>L’Entrée du Roi en sa capitale</i> (1818), a one-act <i>opéra
  vaudeville</i> interspersed with popular French airs and chansons; and <i>La
  Partie de chasse du Roi</i> (1820), a three-act opera with music by a
  certain “M. Cassian, haytien.” Drawing from a well of inherited influences,
  these two works are remarkable in their incorporation of French
  <i>opéra-comique</i>, West African slave song, and Caribbean Creole,
  demonstrating the triangular trade through which Haitian sovereignty was
  earliest expressed. In so doing, they help us understand how decolonization
  reexamines and recreates traditions old and new—how independence works in
  practice, if not in theory.</p>
  <p>Deriving case studies from these materials, I ask: how did Chanlatte’s
  operas speak to the aspirations of the Christophean crown? And how do they
  subscribe to and subvert French operatic and imperial trends? In so doing, I
  work toward a sensitive historicization of Christophe’s court and advocate for
  the musicological study of Haiti and the circum-Caribbean. Haiti’s music, I go
  on to claim, might teach us of the vocabularies and vagaries of
  decolonization—of sounding off and ringing hollow. </p>
