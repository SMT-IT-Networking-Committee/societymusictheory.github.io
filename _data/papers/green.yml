abstract: |
  <p>On 31 May 1942, radio listeners nationwide tuned in to their local CBS
  station and heard an opening sonic salvo from tin cans, woodblock, muted gong,
  and ratchet. The narrator soon declared, “Today the <i>Workshop</i> presents
  <i>The City Wears a Slouch Hat</i> by Kenneth Patchen. The score is for sound
  orchestra by John Cage” and audiences were suddenly thrust into a noisy urban
  soundscape. Cage himself would position the positive reception of this radio
  play as a turning point in his career and impetus for relocating from Chicago
  to New York City.</p>
  <p>Yet, Cage scholars have neglected to contextualize this work in relation to
  radio drama composition more broadly. There has also been correspondingly
  little analysis of Cage’s score, which I suggest tactically signals dramatic
  actions, a concept historian Neil Verma refers to as “scenic referentiality,”
  while also creating a texture in which music and sound effect are interwoven.
  Utilizing a close reading of Cage’s compositional techniques, I argue that
  <i>Slouch Hat</i> offers a rare view of the composer’s relationship to textual
  and dramatic setting, one that places the work among debates over sound and
  meaning on contemporary radio.</p>
  <p>My analysis will also draw upon unpublished correspondence from
  Northwestern University’s John Cage Collection, the value of which lies beyond
  the composer’s own writings: letters sent to CBS from radio listeners
  nationwide in reaction to the premiere of <i>Slouch Hat</i>. While many
  listeners were delighted with Cage’s contribution to challenging conventions
  of the radio play genre, others found Cage’s music too extreme, often
  employing references to insanity or mental health generally. This
  correspondence shows how audiences engaged with and debated about the
  avant-garde, even in unexpected places such as a CBS radio drama; each
  listener, regardless of their approval or disapproval, participated in a
  broader debate about sound’s role in the construction of plot and drama. By
  attending to the context surrounding Cage’s radio play, including the
  reception by a well-read but popular audience, we are afforded a unique view
  of broadcast’s role in shaping the production and reception of music on and
  for radio.</p>
