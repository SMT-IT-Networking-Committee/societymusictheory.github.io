title: "“salt strange and sweet”: Timbre and Tension in <i>Written on Skin</i>"

abstract: |
  <p>By 2019, <i>Written on Skin</i> (2012) will have had ninety-seven
  performances, a remarkable feat for an opera which has eschewed the current
  vogue for adaptation of popular literature, celebrity biography, or film. I
  will build on the discussions of Whittall (2014), McClary (2015), Abbate and
  Parker (2015), Dillon (2018), and Maria Ryan (2018, in Cook, Kolassa, and
  Whittaker) to focus on a particular tension in the opera: that of intimacy and
  distance, as realized through timbre in George Benjamin’s score. Through
  Hans-Thies Lehmann’s <i>Postdramatic Theatre</i> (1999, trans. Jürs-Munby
  2006), I will examine the features of Martin Crimp’s libretto which emphasize
  narrative distancing and resist the intimacy of the opera’s medieval story.
  Drawing together Carolyn Abbate’s discussion of the performance of narrative
  in Wagner (<i>Unsung Voices</i>, 1999: 159) with the writings on timbre of
  Dolan (2013), Boulez (1987), and Schnittke (trans. 2002), and a recent special
  issue of <i>Contemporary Music Review</i> (36.6, 2017), I will suggest that
  Benjamin’s score performs narrative through timbre: timbre enacts the opera’s
  tensions of intimacy and estrangement to create a complex musical irony that
  both undermines and reinforces the libretto’s distancing devices.</p>
  <p>I will parse four examples from the opera in which Benjamin uses timbral
  modulation, specifically involving the singing voice, along with unusual
  instrumentation and orchestration, to allow the ear to hear what the eye
  can’t—and won’t—see. Thus Benjamin uses timbre as a way of informing operatic
  irony: both for the audience and the characters, in an opera fixated on what
  is not seen but what is described (e.g. the Boy’s illuminations), on
  voyeurism, literacy and power, and the inscription and transcription of
  knowledge. I will discuss the role of the original cast in Benjamin’s use of
  timbre in these examples, the challenges to conventional notation and reliance
  on performance practice this necessitates, and the implications of this for
  the casts, orchestras, and directors of future productions. To conclude, I
  will suggest that exploring Benjamin’s use of timbre offers insight into some
  of the popular press criticism of the opera’s full staging, and its success in
  unstaged and semi-staged presentations.</p>
