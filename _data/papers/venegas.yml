abstract: |
    <p>Bruckner’s treatment of form and the textual idiosyncrasies of his
    symphonies loom large in his music’s reception history. Because the idea
    of a “Bruckner symphony” is hard to match with traditional notions of
    authenticity and authorship, Bruckner scholarship has operated under
    text-critical discourses that construe his oeuvre as defective and
    problematic. Similarly, in addressing traditional and innovative formal
    aspects of Bruckner’s music, critics have tended to overemphasize one side
    or the other; some judging his symphonies as formless, others considering
    them excessively predictable and overly reliant on classical models. It
    seems then that a more constructive appraisal of Bruckner’s music requires
    an epistemological change of gears. Towards that aim, this paper presents
    an analysis-based method that embraces the particularities of Bruckner’s
    music as its foremost potential.</p>

    <p>The scope of the study is restricted to Bruckner’s slow movements.
    Building upon James Hepokoski’s dialogic approach, I propose conceiving
    formal-expressive meaning in Bruckner’s symphonic Adagios as growing out
    of a two-dimensional dialogue. First, there is the outward dialogue (the
    Hepokoskian dialogic dimension), in which the individual exemplar
    dialogues with its implied genre. Second, I suggest considering an inward
    dialogue among the various versions of a single movement, and the
    interplay between inward and outward dialogues.</p>

    <p>The proposed analytical method has the advantage of both accounting for
    Bruckner’s formal idiosyncrasies and turning the “Bruckner Problem” into
    the Bruckner Potential. It provides an analytical/theoretical framework
    that clears the way for a more nuanced and sympathetic understanding of
    Bruckner’s music.</p>
