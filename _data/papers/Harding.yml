        <p>Jennifer Harding is a Lecturer of Music Theory at University of Massachusetts Amherst. She holds graduate degrees in music theory and violin performance from Florida State University and Northern Illinois University. Her research uses computational approaches to music analysis to answer questions about harmony in the music of a wide range of composers. Jennifer's recent dissertation, “Applications of the Discrete Fourier Transform to Music Analysis," offers several approaches for investigating harmony through the lens of the Fourier transform.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>Musical maps are a visual representation of data from another domain, invoking spatial metaphors to render abstract information more concrete. Recent scholarship using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has yielded fruitful theoretical and analytical results by evaluating the “fuzzy membership” of both pitch classes and rhythms to cyclic patterns. Visualizations are helpful for conveying and exploring the complex numerical results of applying the DFT to these musical parameters. Justin Hoffman’s 2008 cartographies plot the location of pitch-class multisets (sets that allow for more than one instance of a pitch class) within spaces generated by the different Fourier components. I map the harmonies from three different musical excerpts onto these spaces, providing insight into both the music and the spaces themselves.</p>
    <p>The sonorities in a J. S. Bach chorale exhibit clustering within the fifth Fourier component space (correlating with “diatonicity”). An excerpt from Thomas Adès’s <em>The Four Quarters</em> shows a very different pattern of clustering in the space of the fourth Fourier component, which corresponds to “octatonicity.” The visualization clarifies the relative saturation of the two fully-diminished-seventh chords that comprise an octatonic collection within the sonority. Finally, I map the opening of the “Chorale” from Charles Ives’s <em>Three Quarter-Tone Pieces</em> onto several Fourier component spaces, revealing striking similarities to the chorale by Bach. These similarities suggest that using Fourier space to describe pitch-class collections can be a compelling and methodical way to approach microtonal and other unusual collections.</p>
