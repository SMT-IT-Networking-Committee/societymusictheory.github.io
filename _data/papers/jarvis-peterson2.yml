    <p>A strength of online, open-source materials is their ability to be flexibly adapted by users to fit their particular needs. While it is increasingly common for print textbooks to include access to an online companion site, those materials are, understandably, closely aligned with the terminology, progression of topics, and pacing of the book they accompany. Lack of customizability can be a hindrance if an instructor prefers to present content in a different order, as later assessments may require students to know terminology from earlier chapters. <em>OMT2</em> uses a combination of online quizzing strategies to combine the best of both worlds: alignment and customizability. In this talk, we introduce two categories of quizzes we created for <em>OMT2</em>: (1) in-line chapter comprehension quizzes using H5P—an open-source quizzing platform that we will introduce; and (2) customizable quizzes meant to be deployed through a user’s Learning Management System (i.e., Blackboard, Canvas, etc.). In both cases, we are focused on developing quizzes that can help students practice not only foundational skills, such as spelling triads and key signatures, but also more complex ones, such as hearing hypermeter or analyzing form. In our presentation, we’ll showcase some of the ways in which we’ve used H5P and our LMSs to develop these quizzes that practice these more complex skills, then we’ll work in small groups to brainstorm ways in which we can further leverage the power of these quizzing platforms to create auto-graded practice of advanced concepts for students.</p>
