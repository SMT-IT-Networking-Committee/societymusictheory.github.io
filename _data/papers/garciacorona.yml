abstract: |
  <p>The <i>trío romántico</i> was a style of music popular during the late
  1940s, fifties, and beginning of the sixties in Mexico and in many other Latin
  American countries. It became the preferred musical vehicle for the most
  popular genre at the time: the bolero. Boleros, through their romantic and
  sentimental lyrics, not only voiced themes of love, but also revealed deep
  feelings of vulnerability. Trio Los Tres Reyes were among the top five trios
  of the era. Two of their original members live in San Antonio. With a new
  leading voice, Los Tres Reyes today perform their classic hits and speak about
  social issues and new vulnerabilities. In this presentation, I explore the
  performative connections between the trio style and ideas of Mexicanness in
  San Antonio that go beyond discourses of modernity and cosmopolitanism usually
  associated with romantic music from mid-twentieth-century Mexico. By looking
  at Los Tres Reyes’ recent musical production in San Antonio, I show how the
  use of the trio style departs from an idealized past and emphasizes a troubled
  present by focusing on local political issues. I call attention to this
  mid-century singing style as an agent of social change, particularly for those
  with Mexican/American heritage living in the US in the current political
  climate.</p>
