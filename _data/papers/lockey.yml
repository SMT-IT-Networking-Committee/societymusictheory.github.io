abstract: |
  <p>The <i>siciliana</i> emerged as an identifiable character type at the
  crossroads of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and went on to become
  one of the most ubiquitous choices for representations of—and allusions to—the
  pastoral realm in music for the remainder of the eighteenth century. Occurring
  in a broad range of vocal and instrumental genres in both sacred and secular
  contexts, the character type has often been linked to idyllic settings and
  tender emotions, forming a vehicle for imparting a sense of tranquility,
  longing, or melancholy. Yet a closer examination of the vast siciliana
  repertoire reveals a wider expressive scope that also encompasses themes of
  seduction and tragedy. </p>
  <p>Using a variety of examples, this paper advances two crucial arguments.
  First, I show how the siciliana became a significant vehicle for the
  expression of female lamentation, inheriting a role once held primarily by
  seventeenth-century ostinato-bass laments. Second, I make the case that the
  siciliana often embodied a confluence of desires for emotional immediacy,
  escapist idealism, and the objectification of female expression. This last
  facet comes about, in part, through the repeated use of sicilianas to engage
  poetic themes that were assigned to female characters more often than male
  characters, an association that even extended to male characters’ utterances
  by means of references within sicilianas—both subtle and blatant—to images of
  idealized female expression, raising the possibility that the siciliana itself
  might have served as an additional symbol of this constructed poeticism.</p>
  <p>Informed by a broader view of the expressive range of the siciliana, I
  examine the important aesthetic and historiographical ramifications that
  result from varied perceptions of the siciliana as a musical character type.
  In particular, I argue that to underestimate the expressive scope of the
  siciliana—a risk derived from lending too much credence to certain
  eighteenth-century writers’ emphasis on the “simplicity” of this character
  type—is to practice a further form of misogyny by denying the poetic and
  rhetorical complexity allotted even to this constructed image of female
  expression.</p>
