    <p>It is no secret that the video game industry codifies gendered stereotypes; these appear in marketing campaigns promoting games to specific audiences, in mechanics and visual illustrations of characters in games, and in various video game genres. In this paper, I scrutinize the construction of gender in the musical elements of soundtracks in role-playing games. Expanding upon Michael Austin’s work (2018), I examine how musical gender construction compares with the visual and interactive representations of gender on the screen. </p>
    <p>Using <em>Nier: Automata</em> as the primary case, I employ neo-Riemannian theory to demonstrate how harmony and texture subvert typical gendered expectations established by other role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. For example, many boss-battle music cues in <em>Nier: Automata</em> showcase harmonic progressions employing slide transformations. Moments like these replace the historically-masculinized aeolian “victory cadence” first established in the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. and later adopted by the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series.</p>
    <p>However, a conflict exists when we contrast musical observations with the visual and interactive elements. Hypersexualization of main character Android “2B,” portrayals of male fantasy, and hegemonic power dynamics comprise some of the gendered stereotypes experienced in-game. A ludomusical dissonance sustains between the aural and visual images of the main characters. This specific disjunction characterizes only one of the various relationships between the gendered musical and visual elements in video games. In examining the gendered ludomusical dissonance in <em>Nier: Automata</em>, my paper shows that dissecting musical representations of gender, in relation to the visual and interactive constructions, transforms unnecessarily gendered perceptions.</p>
