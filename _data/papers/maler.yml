  <p>Terms borrowed from theories of Classical form appear with surprising
  frequency in analytical forays into post-tonal repertoires. But despite their
  pervasiveness, these terms are generally not well-defined. Alfred Schnittke’s
  polystylistic oeuvre provides an ideal entry point for an exploration of one
  such under-defined concept: the cadence. In this paper, I argue that Schnittke
  addresses this issue of definition musically in the Concerto for Viola and
  Orchestra (1985) and String Quartet no. 3 (1983). In grappling with
  Schnittke’s unorthodox cadential gestures in these two works, I face not
  simply an analytical challenge, but a definitional conundrum—and one that
  requires an expansion of the definitional frame.</p>
  <p>My analysis identifies two cadential types found in the first movement of
  the Concerto: the first type achieves formal closure with post-tonal musical
  content, while the second type employs tonal cadential materials to affect a
  post-tonal context. The first is represented by a dissonant, post-tonal
  cadence, defined by its chromatic voice-leading in contrary motion and
  repeated three times in ever-expanding iterations; the second is represented
  by the decontextualized contrapuntal cadence in the first movement’s final ten
  measures. By bringing into conflict different kinds of closure, I propose that
  Schnittke asks the listener what a cadence can mean in a post-tonal context. I
  further argue that by confronting the difficulties of defining the cadence in
  both the Concerto for Viola and Orchestra and String Quartet no. 3, we can
  come to a richer understanding of what “cadence” signifies in post-tonal
  music, and more broadly.</p>
