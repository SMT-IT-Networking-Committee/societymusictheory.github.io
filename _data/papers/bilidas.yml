    <p>A “cutting contest” is a public challenge between two skilled tap
    dancers, who alternate increasingly elaborate rhythmic sequences,
    beginning with eight bars per sequence, ultimately reducing to a single
    bar. Dancers must enter on time (pick-ups and syncopated entrances are
    permitted), lest they forfeit the contest. At the start of the contest,
    the tap dancers and judges negotiate the meter and tempo of the contest.
    The judge gives a count-off bar and the first dancer begins as the only
    “musical source.” The original meter is maintained by the judge through
    the tapping of his/her feet, although rendered inaudible by the audience’s
    verbal reactions to the dancer’s steps. The opponent keeps his eyes locked
    on the soloist as he silently counts. Since tap dancers create the audible
    rhythmic patterns, while the meter is “unheard,” dancers use metric
    dissonance (Krebs 1999; Love 2013) in hopes of metrically misleading one’s
    opponent.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I aim to demonstrate that tap dancers use metrical
    dissonance as means of confusing their opponents. I will examine solos by
    Joshua Johnson, Jumaane Taylor, and Sarah Reich. Since the primary goal of
    the opponent is to be able to identify the meter at all times, tap
    soloists strategize their own unpitched tap shoes to accent metrical
    dissonances that cloud the original meter.</p>
