  <p>An important part of the recent growth in scholarship on meter focuses on
  reconstructing eighteenth-century listening practices. Danuta Mirka (2009)
  studies contemporary accounts of meter in theory treatises to build a model of
  eighteenth-century metric listening, while Stefan Love (2016) takes a corpus
  studies approach, arguing that surveying repertoire provides a more accurate
  view of meter than eighteenth-century theorists. But despite the known debt
  that much eighteenth-century art music owes to dance and dance music, Mirka
  and Love only briefly mention dance. In touching so lightly on dance, these
  and other authors overlook the more fundamental connection between meter and
  movement. In this paper I examine late-eighteenth-century French contredanses
  and their music to propose a model of contemporary metric hearing that unites
  literal and musical motion.</p>
  <p>There are three features of the contredanse and dancing in general that
  support their relevance to eighteenth-century metric experience. First is the
  contredanse’s role in society—recent writers on eighteenth-century music often
  present the minuet as the premier dance of the century, but though it remained
  the most aristocratic dance, by the middle of the century it had been
  surpassed in popularity by the contredanse. Second, contredanses involved
  multiple dancers moving simultaneously, and music helped them coordinate their
  movements. As a result, hypermetrical schemas matching hypermeasures with
  dance moves could develop. Finally, the experience of moving in time with
  musical meter likely had a positive effect on dancers’ ability to find meter
  in music in general.</p>
