Drumming of Guinea"

abstract: |
    <p>According to Justin London’s <i>many meters hypothesis</i>, meters are
    “highly context-specific patterns of temporal expectation that govern our
    attention to, as well as performance of, rhythmic sequences” (London 2012,
    8), where each meter is “a coordinated set of periodic temporal cycles of
    sensorimotor attention” (91). By aligning London’s concept of temporal
    cycles with Gerhard Kubik’s four African “basic, cross-culturally valid
    reference levels with regard to timing: … elementary pulsation[s], …
    reference beat[s], … cycle[s]” (Kubik 2010, 31), and “time-line patterns”
    (57), this paper seeks to establish an analytical procedure to quantify
    the many meters used in Guinean Malinke dance drumming.</p>
    <p>Guinean Malinke dance drumming is performed by an eight-to-ten-part
    polyrhythmic percussion ensemble. The music is constructed of cycles of
    multiple repeating patterns of varying lengths. While many accompaniments
    are multi-use, each piece utilizes an identity pattern in the form of an
    eight- to sixteen-beat melo-rhythmic conversation between two of the
    drums. This paper analyzes a corpus of 76 pieces as taught and published
    by former national ballet drummers to establish the many meters at work in
    Malinke dance drumming. I then demonstrate the ways in which the identity
    pattern and accompaniments of each piece may be expressed as contours of
    varying strength and weakness relative to its multiple specific, both
    isochronous and non-isochronous (timeline), metric layers. A
    quantification of these overlapping shapes allows a view of the depth and
    complexity of this music.</p>
