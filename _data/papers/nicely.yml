title: "Specifically Generic Accompaniments: Clump Vectors in Guinean Malinke Dance Drumming"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Guinean Malinke dance drumming incorporates three types of musical parts
  within a polyrhythmic fabric of four to ten simultaneous patterns: a
  background of multi-use supporting accompaniments, a middleground of
  melo-rhythmic themes specific to each piece, and a foreground of licks and
  improvised passages in dialogue with the dancers and unique to each
  performance. All parts are contextualized by multiple isochronous and
  non-isochronous temporal layers, including a steady tactus embodied in the
  dancers’ feet, at least one layer of tactus subdivisions, and a timeline. This
  analysis examines the ways in which background stock accompaniments played on
  bells, <i>kenkenis </i>(small stick drums), and djembes shape the musical
  landscape by providing a context of specific musical relationships. </p>
  <p>My analysis is based on two fundamental aspects of this genre: that
  rhythmic motives have quantifiable shape and direction relative to the
  multiple temporal layers that contextualize them, and that this momentum often
  simultaneously inhabits different envelopes relative to different layers,
  creating musical complexity and depth. I focus on “clumps”: pairs of attacks
  moving at the fastest increments of the texture, analyzing each clump via a
  three-digit vector reflecting the relative “to-ness,” “from-ness,” and
  “neutral-ness” of each clump relative to all context layers. This paper first
  analyzes the “potential” clump vectors of thirteen stock accompaniments by
  calculating their vectors to all possible temporal context layer types used in
  the genre. Specific orchestrations of six to seven accompaniments combined by
  professional Guinean Malinke drummers are then analyzed to explore their
  specific exploitation of clump vectors.</p>
