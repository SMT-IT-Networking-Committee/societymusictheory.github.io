    <p>Mahler’s symphonies frequently progress in a manner that negates the traditional directionality of symphonic form, allowing for multiple temporalities within a single work or movement (Johnson 2014, 2017; Monahan 2015; Samuels 2011). As Johnson (2017) notes, Mahler’s forms incorporate moments of “structural self-reflection,” where the music halts forward progression and gives way to a static passage. In this paper, I argue that one such moment of reflexivity—in the Scherzo of Mahler’s Fifth Symphony—is more than a break from the symphony’s formal flow. Using Bergson’s concept of “pure memory,” I show how this reflexive space expands the Scherzo’s possible future actions from linear and pre-determined to open and free-associative.</p>
    <p>The movement begins as a typical five-part scherzo with two contrasting trios. Its formal boundaries become blurred, however, in the latter half of the piece. A moment of reflexivity appears midway through the second trio, acting as an invocation of pure memory that halts the work’s flow; after this point, the relatively routine linear progression of the scherzo is denied. The second trio is expanded significantly, and a development is introduced that incorporates musical material from the refrain and both trios. These sections appear as a non-linear jumble of motives, as the return of each section is densely permeated with other sections’ material. Viewing pure memory as a constitutive component of the Scherzo’s form allows for musical progression that exists outside of linear temporality, while providing a means of perceiving structural coherence amid such seemingly chaotic instances of motivic density.</p>
