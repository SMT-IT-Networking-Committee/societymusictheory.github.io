    <p>Igor Stravinsky once stated that he suffered from a rare form of
    kleptomania, stealing others’ music to “make it his own.” Balanchine, his
    choreographic collaborator for many iconic ballets of the twentieth century,
    followed a similar path, also reworking the ideas and practices of dance and
    other art forms to create a unique neoclassical style. Even his widely known
    saying “See the music, hear the dance,” was not strictly his own. Rather, it
    came from essayist Glenway Wescott who wrote in 1963 that “Suddenly
    I <i>see</i> the music; suddenly I <i>hear</i> the movements of the dancers.”
    Wescott had good reason to attribute musical powers to the choreographer, for
    Balanchine was broadly trained as a musician: his piano and music theory
    studies allowed him to provide piano accompaniment for his dancers. Moreover,
    Balanchine’s singular training and disposition made his choreography integral
    to the music he chose.</p>

    <p>My title reworks the words of Balanchine, suggesting that we as
    musicians can benefit from “hearing” his choreography. Music theory has
    gladly embraced the study of physical movement, and especially the
    movement of human bodies, as a meaningful source and analog for our own
    attentions to the metaphor of musical movement.  The study of ballet,
    especially when a choreographer draws upon sophisticated musical
    understanding, gives us the opportunity to hear what we see, and see what
    we hear. In this talk I will join physical and metaphorical movement in
    two of Balanchine’s iconic ballets, his setting of Tchaikovksy’s
    <i>Serenade for Strings</i> and his collaboration with Stravinsky for the
    ballet <i>Orpheus</i>. Taking Balanchine’s cue, I hope to show how musical
    and dance movement partner one another.</p>
