abstract: |
    <p>Contrapuntal rhythm (hereafter CR) is the rate at which fundamental
    counterpoint progresses, expressed as a durational value, most often the
    minim. Accurate assessment of CR in Renaissance music is crucial for
    several analytical procedures including reduction, similarity comparisons,
    and the quantification of style change. While the concept of CR has been
    extensively theorized by Ruth DeFord (2015), the present study is the
    first to offer a precise and dynamic means of ascertaining it in
    Renaissance music. The main analytical considerations of my
    period-inspired and fully reproducible approach for assessing a piece’s CR
    are dissonance treatment, attack density, and cadence placement. When done
    by an analyst, counterpoint reduction can be convincing and dynamic, but
    difficult to reproduce by others; conversely, the two prevailing automated
    methods take observations at every new note (“salami slicing”, Christopher
    White, Ian Quinn, 2014) or at regular rhythmic intervals (Christopher
    Antila, Julie Cumming); both of these approaches are perfectly
    reproducible but not dynamic and therefore necessarily occasionally
    inaccurate. By contrast, an essential tenet of my approach is that CR is
    generally stable, but can and does vary within a single piece, without the
    need of a change in notated time signature. I begin with an examination of
    how CR and reduction are addressed by Johannes Tinctoris (1477) and Pietro
    Pontio (1588), then I describe each step of my method with sample
    analyses.</p>
