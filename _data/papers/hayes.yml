title: "Towards a Simondonian Theory of Improvised Music"

abstract: |
  <p>Music that includes improvisation presents an ontological puzzle for
  analysis when it asserts some stable characteristics to a work, while still
  allowing some details to be determined by the performers. Recordings of
  performances or the study of historic improvisatory styles can supply some
  observations, but of a much more generic character than those of analytical
  statements about wholly determinate musical works. Surveying music of John
  Cage, Pierre Boulez, Anthony Braxton and Ana-Maria Avram, this paper addresses
  analytical challenges in contexts where neither the composition as it is
  written, nor a canonical performance, contain the full account of the
  aesthetic object. I propose an approach to such works as “technical objects”
  according to the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon, which rely on human and
  technological relationships for what Simondon called the
  “transindividual.”</p>
  <p>Renewed interest in Simondon’s thought has revived a number of valuable
  ideas that can be adapted to a more rigorously detailed analysis of improvised
  music. Simondon’s mid-twentieth-century philosophy grows out of a study of
  developing technologies of his time. In his effort to provide a theory of
  human-technology interaction, Simondon interprets human creativity within his
  narrative of technological development. By moving the discussion from the
  aesthetic to the technical object, Simondon helps to theorize the invariant
  function and meaning of indeterminate musical passages. The main route of this
  approach leads toward the interpretation of compositional decisions about the
  performance context, the “technical ensemble” comprised of performers,
  technology, the musical work, and the composer.   </p>
