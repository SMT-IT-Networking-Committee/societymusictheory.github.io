  <p>Much of the cadential and phrase-structural organization of the
  first-movement exposition of Schubert’s “Unfinished” Symphony in B minor, D.
  759 (1822) is obviously reminiscent of classical precedents. Yet few of its
  specifics fall readily within the categories established by recent theories of
  classical form—Caplin’s theory of formal functions or Hepokoski and Darcy’s
  sonata theory; indeed, the work’s individuality pointedly resists the
  wholesale application of either model.</p>
  <p>In this paper I argue that theories of classical form can nonetheless
  inform an analytical practice tailored specifically to romantic music,
  provided aspects of those theories are modified, recombined, and reconfigured.
  I develop my thesis through two analytical vignettes. I first analyze the
  exposition’s main-theme and transition functions, showing how they generate a
  series of multiple—and in part mutually incompatible—retrospective
  reinterpretations that resists a satisfactory “final-state” analysis. In the
  second vignette I argue that the subordinate theme, in spite of its seemingly
  discontinuous and at times highly dramatized surface, is best understood as
  one single overarching sentential design.</p>
  <p>Both analyses demonstrate a mode of formal organization that is
  characteristic of much romantic music, and in which units of the length of a
  simple classical theme are nested within relatively long and hierarchically
  complex thematic units. More importantly, they show how classical theories of
  form can go a long way in interpreting individual smaller-scale building
  blocks in this repertoire, but that the larger constellations in which those
  building blocks appear are sui generis and unheard of in classical music.</p>
