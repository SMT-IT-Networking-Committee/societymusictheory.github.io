    <p>The semantic importance of musical styles and genres in the early
    eighteenth century is often viewed within the framework of the Classical
    style: topics from the late Baroque are valued as gateways to the
    interpretation of later music, but their hermeneutic usefulness is not often
    explored in earlier contexts. This is likely because immediate musical
    oppositions common in the Classical style are not generally present in the
    late Baroque. I argue, however, that topics are a principal component of the
    semiotics of Baroque <i>opera seria</i>, specifically in works by G. F.
    Handel. Handel’s primary topical strategy was to employ one topic in each solo
    aria such that the interaction of topics, lyric, and drama lead to an
    interpretation of the featured character. However, there are other, less
    pervasive strategies for topical signification present in Handel’s operas.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most common secondary strategy involves what I have termed
    <i>topical reversal</i>, in which a topic is used in a manner that is
    antithetical to its typical appearance or dramatic associations. Another
    secondary strategy sometimes found in Handel’s operas is the use of a
    <i>topical region</i> or <i>theme</i>, in which one particular topic is
    used for several successive (or nearly successive) arias or is
    foregrounded across the work, suggesting comparison of its different
    iterations. Finally, although only one topic is expected per aria or
    movement in Baroque music, I posit that Handel sometimes used <i>two
    topics simultaneously</i>. I will provide examples of these three
    secondary topical strategies, speculate on their frequency, and offer
    interpretations.</p>
