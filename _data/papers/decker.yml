He holds the M.M. and Ph.D. in music theory from Florida State University and was the winner of the National Opera Association’s biennial dissertation prize (2013).

abstract: |
    <p>The waltz has a special place in musicals that almost no other topic does: we know when we hear it that the subject, somehow in some way, has to do with love. Although waltzes do not have a monopoly on romance in musicals, the waltz’s semiotics are complex enough for many different kinds of situations having to do with love, including comic and ironic uses. The waltz gained these topical associations from several sources: its use as a European and American social dance in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; the method of dancing itself, which involved a whirling motion while in close contact with one dancing partner; and its use in concert music, salon and parlor music, operetta, and, to some extent, music hall and vaudeville. In this talk, I will briefly substantiate these potential associations using a survey of over 200 popular songs and operetta numbers written between 1885 and 1930. I will then turn to some waltz numbers from later Broadway shows (after 1940–present) and examine the ways in which these associations have been manipulated to highlight different aspects of the topic’s possible meanings and underpin a range of situations involving love, romance, and sex.</p>
