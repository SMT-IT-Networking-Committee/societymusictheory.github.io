abstract: | 
    <p>While most research in the arts and humanities has embraced specialization, music theory has a rich history of transcending disciplinary boundaries. Since the latter part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, research within music theory has experienced an expansion fueled by fruitful conversations with linguistics, mathematics, computer science, psychology, literary theory, philosophy, gender studies, semiotics, and many other fields, borrowing their concepts, perspectives, methods, and theories. As a result, today’s research in music theory is intrinsically cross-disciplinary, unbound by the barriers that define historically sharp divisions between the arts, the humanities, and the sciences.</p>
    <p>However, most cross-disciplinary inquiry in music theory has been the product of individuals working alone and has neglected <em>team-based</em> cross-disciplinary research, where scholars from all sides of campus exchange expertise and collaborate to produce new knowledge. Solo cross-disciplinary work, though relevant and necessary, is insufficient by itself to address the complex and pressing research questions that demand our attention. Team-based cross-disciplinary work, instead, drives bold advances in knowledge, bridging the methodological, perspectival, and rhetorical disciplinary divides, and propelling innovative solutions to the urgent threats and extraordinary challenges of the new century. Continuing to allow music theory to forsake team-based cross-disciplinary research, therefore, may potentially undermine its relevance for offering the kinds of insights our 21<sup>st</sup> century requires. </p>
    <p>Team-based cross-disciplinary work presents us with an opportunity to unlock a renewed relevance of music theory. This is an opportunity we must seize. Engaging our students in team-based cross-disciplinary inquiry will afford them unique opportunities to apply knowledge, prepare them for modes of inquiry necessary for graduate-level and beyond-academic-boundaries research, lead them to seek a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of problems, and give them the translational tools and skills needed to become agents of change working within a complex, global, rapidly evolving society.</p>
    <p>This brief talk is by no means a critical evaluation of the current state of research in music theory. Instead, it attempts to broaden the conversation about music theory pedagogy by recognizing how our discipline functions within the overall scheme of team-based cross-disciplinary research, bridging the space between academia and society. It presents personal insights, snapshots, and suggestions that may serve as inspiration for faculty seeking to integrate and foster team-based cross-disciplinary inquiry within our 21<sup>st</sup>-century undergraduate and graduate curricula.</p>
