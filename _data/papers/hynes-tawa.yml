    <p>“China is a major-mode country—it has no minor-mode sounds. Japan is a minor-mode country, and it has no major-mode sounds.”</p>
    <p>The above is a free translation of an extract from Yoshida Kenkō’s fourteenth-century <em>Tsurezuregusa</em>. He did not, of course, actually write about the major and minor modes as the West would come to know them, but Japanese musicians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would have interpreted his pronouncement along such lines, because of the way they mapped Japanese modes onto Western tonality after the Meiji Restoration of 1868. The way Japanese musicians adapted the Western minor mode in the service of harmonizing their own modes has been discussed before, but this paper brings more attention to the identification of the minor mode itself with Japan, and on the comparative foreignness of the major.</p>
    <p>In its effort to become a formidable competitor on the stage of Western-style imperialism, Japanese musicians faced a dilemma: they had to assimilate the Western major mode, while at the same time re-theorizing and legitimizing their own modes, which coded to Western ears as minor. This paper tracks the meanings held by the major-minor binary in Japan’s imperial period between 1868 and 1945, teasing out the various ways in which the major mode’s alignment with Western powers and the minor’s alignment with Japan’s own background was leveraged towards a nation-building project with consequences that produced curious musical results and a legacy of violent trauma that remains painful today for a great many peoples.</p>
