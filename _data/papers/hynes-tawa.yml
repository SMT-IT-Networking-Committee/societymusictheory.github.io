      bio: |
        <p>Liam Hynes-Tawa is a music theorist currently teaching at Yale University, with specializations in modern Japanese and Renaissance European forms of tonality. This research usually involves trying to figure out how irreconcilable ways of thinking about pitch have dealt with each other, as well as the entertainingly vexing question of what modes and keys even are. Liam has earned a BA in Music and East Asian Studies from Brown University, a PhD in Music Theory from Yale University, and recent publications in the journals <em>Intégral</em> and <em>Analytical Approaches to World Music.</em></p>

abstract: | 
    <p>Like many non-Western composers who came of age in a world threatened by Western dominance and colonialism, the Japanese composer Yamada Kōsaku (山田耕筰, 1886–1965) originally trained along Western lines, under German composers. As he grew in fame and security, however, he pioneered an approach in which traditional Japanese elements would over time be incorporated into, and eventually displace, Western syntax. This process was by no means straightforward—how can one provincialize Western syntax in a tradition whose very prestige value rests on its Westernness?</p>
    <p>This paper investigates the evolution of Yamada’s strategy across three symphonic works. These works show a steady progression of moving “Japanese”-signifying elements from a position of ornamental window-dressing to one of central structural importance, which in turn displaces Western tonal syntax from its central position to a subsidiary one. <em>Triumph and Peace</em> (1912) is a four-movement symphony in the Austro-German tradition with only a brief nod to anything traditionally Japanese, <em>Inno Meiji</em> (1921) is a symphonic poem that incorporates <em>gagaku</em>-based pitch material more substantially while still being often driven by Western syntax, and the <em>Nagauta Symphony “Tsurukame”</em> (1934) completely overturns the previous pieces’ hierarchies by fitting a Western-style accompaniment to a pre-existing Japanese theatre song, allowing the latter to dictate the proceedings. I demonstrate that as we progress in time through Yamada’s works, an analyst must increasingly allow Western harmonic analysis to give way to concepts from traditional Japanese music in order to make any sense of them.</p>
