abstract: |
  <p>The music example has always held pride of place in music-theoretical
  rhetoric. David Lewin’s fabled opening sentences plunge straight into a
  discussion of the first example. But the precise feature that makes the music
  example attractive to the specialist—presenting relevant information in its
  most compressed form—puts up a barrier to the layman, or anyone unable to
  decipher its technicalities.</p>
  <p>Digital technology has revolutionized music. As music is increasingly
  approached from a processual (as opposed to synoptic) perspective, static
  images present a number of shortcomings that digital animations can overcome.
  This simultaneity of sound and graphic can even convey demanding analytical
  maneuvers to non-specialists: viewers can hear <i>and</i> see what’s going
  on.</p>
  <p>Three examples of analytical animations, taken from the nineteenth-century
  repertoire, communicate highly technical information and still engage an
  audience beyond a circle of specialists: Stephen Malinowski’s visualizations,
  Ramaswamy and Caplan-Bricker’s representations of neo-Riemannian
  <i>Tonnetze</i>, and voice-leading animations in Callender, Quinn, and
  Tymoczko. Each animation offers an interpretive surplus, encouraging listeners
  to experience the piece of music in a particular way.</p>
  <p>Like music examples in print, these animations help focus the audience’s
  attention while bypassing certain technicalities and foregrounding aspects, by
  means of annotations or movement, that cannot be gauged from the mere
  representation of the musical score alone. These three examples still appeal
  to a relatively small public—prior musical experience and education certainly
  helps understand the intricate points—but their principles can be applied in
  broader public educational contexts.</p>
