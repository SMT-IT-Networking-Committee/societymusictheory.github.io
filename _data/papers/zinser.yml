title: "Considering Texture in/of Virtual Spaces in Three Studio-Produced Pop Records"

abstract: |
    <p>Texture, in music-theoretic contexts, often involves categorical ways of
    framing relationships among “parts.” Yet, advancements in technology have
    allowed for listening conditions that radically complicate assessment of what
    a musical “part” is; complicating matters further, such assessments often take
    place in virtual spaces rather than actual acoustic situations. Building on
    the work of Moore (2012), Moylan (2012), Théberge (2018), and Zagorski-Thomas
    (2018), this paper argues that discussing texture in pop recordings requires
    nuanced consideration of how impressions of virtual sonic spaces are created
    and artfully used to shape a listener’s functional interpretations of sound.
    In natural acoustic spaces, the sounds we perceive are affected by the
    dimensions of the space we occupy; in virtual spaces, this perceptual
    mechanism is reversed—our perception of space is affected, even created, by
    sounds. This lends the music an additional dimension, as unnatural shifts
    between spaces are manageable with ease. While we undoubtedly process more
    familiar syntactic textural relationships, we also assess how sounds interact
    in a space while creating that very space. Musical interpretations in this
    context are shaped by distinctions between the sounds and our subjective
    experience of those sounds. I discuss three stylistically contrasting
    examples: the use of time-based effects in Strange Talk’s “Climbing Walls”
    (2011); sensations of envelopment in Michael Jackson’s “Rock With You” (1979);
    and the use of contrasting spatial impressions as a quasi-syntactic device in
    Ariana Grande’s “No Tears Left to Cry” (2018).</p>
