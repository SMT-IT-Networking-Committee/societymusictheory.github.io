    <p>John Cage first read excerpts from James Joyce’s <em>Finnegans Wake</em> in the late 1920s in <em>transition</em> magazine. The novel influenced Cage’s compositional practice in both specific and diffuse ways. I explore <em>The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs</em> (1942) and Solo for Voice 47 (1970) as specific examples of a transfer of Joycean text and, just as importantly, Joycean structural processes to Cage’s work; a more diffuse connection exists in Cage’s embrace of collage-like compositional methods and the circus performance ethos in works from 1967 (<em>Musicircus</em>) onward, to which Solo 47 points.</p>
    <p>The play of <em>Finnegans Wake</em> with and against sense and syntactic control helped guide Cage’s search for a verbal analog to the “noise” he began incorporating into his music from the late 1930s onward. It became the source of texts and/or titles for many of Cage’s works, both musical and poetic. Touching briefly on parallels with Cage’s ways of assimilating other influences, especially Henry David Thoreau, I examine the uses to which Cage puts Joyce’s words in the two works named above, and touch on several of his textual works, including <em>Writing Through Finnegans Wake/7 out of 23</em> (1977) and the text-piece <em>Muoyce</em> (1982) to determine precisely what the Cage of the 1930s found in Joyce’s final novel and how the Joycean motto Here Comes Everybody served Cage as a metonym for his creative practice and ethos in the final quarter-century of his life.</p>
