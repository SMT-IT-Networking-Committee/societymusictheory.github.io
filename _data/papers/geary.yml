  <p>Despite a renewed interest in early music within the theory community,
  analyzing this repertoire remains a challenge. In short, our methodologies
  lack the comprehensive explanatory power equivalent to tools associated with
  later centuries. A fertile area of research, though, is studying the working
  process of Renaissance musicians. Peter Schubert, Julie Cumming, and Philippe
  Canguilhem have verified that improvising counterpoint was more common among
  fifteenth- and sixteenth-century musicians than previously recognized. Taking
  their work as a starting point, my research is more explicitly analytical. A
  survey of duet canons in mass movements by Josquin confirms that composed
  Renaissance counterpoint closely parallels the rules for improvising
  <i>stretto fuga</i>. However, adopting an improvisation-based analytical model
  also reveals points of divergence between the two musical products, where
  notated works step beyond strict adherence to the improvisatory techniques.
  After reviewing the rules for improvising two-voice canons, I present three
  analytical theses that are supported by musical examples: the <i>strong beat
  preference rule</i>, <i>structural rest</i>, and <i>structural dissonance</i>.
  I conclude by comparing the role of structure in this style and its treatment
  in repertoires from more recent centuries. </p>
