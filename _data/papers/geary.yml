    <p>In many genres of popular music, the drums perform a fixed rhythmic layer called a drum pattern. Further, most analytical methods either compare specific drum patterns to more generalized rhythmic structures or treat the drums as a backdrop for evaluating rhythmic variability in other parts. In twenty-first century mainstream pop, however, the drums alone provide both fixed and variable elements. A close study of Billboard’s top fifty pop songs from 2018 shows that individual tracks have an average of four drum patterns and eight drum pattern changes—the action of moving between adjacent drum patterns—and as many as nine and eighteen. The first goal of this presentation is to outline the three musical characteristics that vary most regularly amongst a song’s multiple drum patterns: number of layers, rhythm, and instrumentation. This corpus also shows that patterns typically match the rhetorical function of formal areas. The second goal is to define two types of drum pattern changes: drum buildups and drum decays. Both of these musical processes can create a sense of trajectory across different spans of musical material as well as for different expressive effects—and the two are regularly combined in individual tracks. Together, analyzing drum patterns and drum pattern changes can be a new way to highlight expressive variability in this repertoire, and it can also be used to refine other types of popular music analysis.</p>
