abstract: |
  <p>The style of Kesha’s 2017 album <i>Rainbow</i> starkly contrasts with her
  previous recordings, <i>Animal</i> (2010) and <i>Warrior</i> (2012).
  <i>Rainbow</i> establishes a new sound, creating a sense of incongruity with
  Kesha’s previous works. Instead of her earlier stylistic features such as
  rapped lyrics, extreme autotuning, and over-produced vocals, <i>Rainbow
  </i>introduces natural timbres, spoken words, and her first use of head voice.
  Kesha’s head voice in <i>Rainbow </i>is marked in opposition to her chest
  voice, including her characteristic rapping. The expressive effect of this
  vocal timbre is atypically disruptive, warranting interpretive reflection. I
  argue that Kesha’s utilization of head voice in <i>Rainbow </i>is best
  understood as an instance of Susan McClary’s “female voice,” signified through
  a strongly gendered feminine timbre which is repeatedly contrasted with a more
  “masculine” chest voice. Kesha’s “female voice” thus reinforces central
  textual, formal, and structural elements in the album. </p>
  <p>This paper considers moments where female subjectivity is coordinated
  through precise and calculated vocal timbres throughout <i>Rainbow</i>,
  including the tracks “Praying” and “Woman.” Because analyses of Kesha’s music
  are largely absent in the music theoretical literature, this essay’s
  methodology draws from the works of popular music specialists and music
  critics including Kate Heidemann, Robert Hatten, Nicola Dibben, and McClary.
