        <p>Joseph Siu is the Undergraduate Program Director and Lecturer in Music Theory at the Music Department of the University of Maryland Baltimore County, where he teaches courses on music theory, keyboard skills, and music cognition and perception. Joseph received his M.A. and Ph.D. in Music Theory from the Eastman School of Music, and his B.Mus. in Piano Performance from the University of Western Ontario. At Eastman, Joseph was awarded the Teaching Assistant Prize for Excellence in Teaching, and his doctoral dissertation on phrase rhythm and sonata form was supported by the Doctoral Fellowship Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</p>
        <p>Joseph’s research interests include phrase rhythm and musical form in 18th- and early 19th- century music, music cognition and perception, and music theory pedagogy. Joseph has presented his music theory and music cognition research at numerous international, national, and regional conferences. Joseph was the recipient of the SOCAN Foundation/George Proctor Prize at the 2017 conference of the Canadian University Music Society, and also the recipient of the Best Student Paper Award at the 2014 conference of the South Central Society for Music Theory. Recently, Joseph was awarded the UMBC CAHSS Dean’s Research Fund Award for his research project on absolute pitch, tone languages, and the tritone paradox. Joseph’s writings can be found in the journal <em>Psychology of Music</em> (2019), the <em>Proceedings of the Ninth European Music Analysis Conference</em> (2017), the cross-disciplinary <em>SciArt Magazine</em> (2017), and the book <em>From Sea to Sea: Perspectives on Music Education in Canada</em> (2007).</p>
        <p>Joseph serves as the Treasurer for the Music Theory Society Mid-Atlantic and has been on MTSMA’s Executive Board since 2018. He also served on MTSMA’s program committee for the 2018 and 2020 conferences and hosted MTSMA’s 2019 conference at UMBC.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>Recent research in phrase rhythm and hypermeter have found that some phrase-rhythmic patterns, such as the end-accented “closing-theme schema,” appear regularly in certain parts of the Classical sonata exposition. These phrase-rhythmic norms can, therefore, be regarded as the first-level defaults according to the compositional preference hierarchy in Sonata Theory. However, besides the closing-theme schema, there has been no systematic study to examine the phrase-rhythmic norms in the other locations of the sonata exposition. Therefore, this study aims to fill that research gap by conducting a corpus analysis of phrase-rhythmic usage in all the first-movement expositions of piano sonatas composed by Haydn and Mozart. This corpus study can then inform our understanding of phrase-rhythmic default levels in Classical sonata form as well as any individual differences in the compositional styles of Haydn and Mozart.</p>
    <p>In Haydn’s and Mozart’s piano sonatas, phrase rhythm in the primary themes are generally regular, while the secondary themes are mostly irregular. However, in the transitions, Haydn and Mozart have different first-level defaults: regular phrase rhythm occurs more often in Haydn’s sonatas, whereas irregular phrase rhythm is the norm in Mozart. When irregular phrase rhythms do occur, Haydn’s sonatas demonstrate a strong preference to focus on a single loosening device, non-quadruple hypermeasures, while Mozart’s sonatas tend to also include the use of metrical reinterpretations and end-accented phrases. This study also reports on the phrase-rhythmic norms at the boundaries of the sonata formal sections and the hypermetric placements for the MCs, the dominant-locks, and the EECs.</p>
