    <p>Probably the most remarkable aspect of Tom Waits’s music is his vocal quality, both its recognizability and variety. His music is also distinctly theatrical, most clearly reflected in three albums of stage music. His songs are full of fictional personas who speak in distinct voices, figuratively and literally.</p>
    <p>In this presentation, I argue that the semiotics of Waits’s vocal techniques, especially his carefully crafted vocal timbres, offer interpretive insights that can cut through otherwise opaque lyrics. Specifically, I argue that there are a relatively small number of character archetypes in Waits’s music, marked by a common vocal timbre. To support my theory, I offer analyses of individual songs and a novel empirical approach that classifies Waits’s vocal timbres into categories.</p>
    <p>Regarding the empirical study, 133 participants each categorized by vocal timbre 40 out of 147 randomly-selected 5-second Waits excerpts. Participants sorted songs into as many as eight categories, provided descriptive labels of timbres, then hierarchically combined groups until there was only one remaining. Acoustic features were also extracted for timbral cues using the MIR toolbox, and texts for each song were analyzed for emotional and topic categories using LIWC2015.</p>
    <p>The resulting similarity matrix for all songs was subjected to cluster analysis, which suggested seven timbral categories or character archetypes. These categories demonstrate different timbral profiles, consistent with distinct vocal characters in Waits’ music. These empirically-derived timbral connections between disparate songs provides an analytical framework to examine intertextual interpretations through the semiotics of vocal timbre.</p>
