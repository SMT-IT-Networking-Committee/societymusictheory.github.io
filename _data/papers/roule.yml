abstract: |
  <p>When Jean-Baptiste Prin retired from his decades-long career as an opera
  dancer and trumpet marine virtuoso in 1742, he bequeathed his music manuscript
  collection to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, where he had spent much of
  his life. In his retirement speech at the Académie, Prin singled out his
  manuscript of trumpet music from the operas of Jean-Baptiste Lully, which he
  suggested might be useful for the Académie’s performances of the composer’s
  works. Treasured by Académie members, the manuscript is preserved at the
  Bibliothèque municipale de Lyon (Rés FM MS 133654). A cursory glance through
  its pages reveals that it is much more than a collection of trumpet music. The
  volume contains layers of repertoire entered by various hands over time,
  evincing signs of functional use that ranged from luxurious keepsake object to
  pedagogical workbook. </p>
  <p>The trumpet pieces were compiled at the order of Marie Adélaïde of Savoy
  (1685–1712), who presented the manuscript to Prin in 1702. Subsequent pages
  contain a tutorial for the trumpet marine and popular vocal airs and dance
  pieces arranged for trumpet marine, including compositions by Prin. Throughout
  the book, music entries are punctuated by engravings of women from Greek
  mythology who are frozen in acts of magical transformation. In this paper, I
  argue that the manuscript’s contents interplayed meaningfully to construct a
  dynamic musical and philosophical experience for the reader. The narrative of
  loss, transformation, and renewal that the engravings weave throughout the
  musical contents mirrors a narrative of learning and mastery that the reader
  would have experienced as he or she explored operatic pieces for trumpet and
  popular pieces for trumpet marine. Though unique in its contents, the volume
  is one of many manuscripts from eighteenth-century France that were
  contributed to by multiple owners with varying musical tastes over time. I
  argue that an understanding of how readers used and experienced Prin’s
  manuscript can shed light on how these manuscripts as a whole were not only
  records of evolving musical tastes, but a unique space in which readers could
  interact with diverse repertoire in a way that was nowhere else possible. </p>
