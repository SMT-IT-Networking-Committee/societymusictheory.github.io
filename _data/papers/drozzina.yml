    <p>Valentina Khopolova (b. 1935) is a prominent Russian music theorist working at the Moscow Lomonosov State University, primarily focusing on twentieth-century classical music. Her work remains overlooked in Western music academic scholarship, while the research of her brother, Yuri Kholopov (1931–2003), is cited profusely (Ewell 2012; Cairns 2014; Segall 2017).</p>
    <p>This paper shows how Kholopova developed a powerful system of “expression parameters,” or EPs for the music of Sofia Gubaidulina, and my own application of the system to Gubaidulina’s repertoire of the 1980s. For Kholopova, the EPs are elements of musical composition expressing drama; they are thematic and primary, and can range from methods of articulation, dynamics, register, etc. Each EP has either a consonant or dissonant value. Ewell (2014) applied the system to Gubaidulina’s Ten Preludes for Solo Cello (1974). I focus on the important but previously disregarded factors that in each given work the pairings are initially <em>neutral</em>; dissonance is never viewed as “negative”; and the binaries work in tandem. I demonstrate how Kholopova’s system especially enriches the understanding of Gubaidulina’s multi-movement works of religious nature for several instruments, such as <em>Rejoice!</em> Sonata for Violin and Cello (1981) and <em>Sieben Worte</em> (1985). <em>Sieben Worte</em> largely explores timbral properties and therefore the set of EPs is selected based on the prominence of harmonic coloring throughout. Kholopova’s mode of analysis retains the dramaturgical meaning, which is at the forefront of the majority of Gubaidulina’s pieces, born out of the dialogue between the pairings and their gradual synthesis.</p>
