abstract: |
  <p>Composed for the celebration of São Paulo city’s four hundredth
  anniversary, Villa-Lobos’s Symphony no. 10 powerfully depicts the first
  contact between the native Tupinambás and José de Anchieta in the founding of
  the city. Using historical references and early ethnographical studies in the
  compositional process, Villa-Lobos crystallizes a shift from his exoticism in
  the 1920s to a historicist perspective on the formation of the Brazilian
  nation. Such representation poses a problem, however. While the pervasiveness
  of imagined indigenism in literature, art, and music has been central in the
  construction of a Brazilian cultural identity (cf. Volpe and Béhague), the
  living indigenous societies are as foreign to Brazilians as they have ever
  been. Indeed, as anthropologist Alcida Ramos argues, Brazilian indigenism is
  analogous to Said’s concept of “orientalism.” </p>
  <p>In this paper, I examine the narrative content of the Symphony as an avenue
  for understanding the representation of identity and difference. Within the
  Symphony, the índio brasileiro is presented in three stages: in a march to
  <i>Pindorama</i> (utopia), the unsettling encounter with Anchieta, and an
  immediate conversion into “civilization.” Significantly, Villa-Lobos places
  the moment of contact at the center of the work, where the Tupinambás
  encounter Anchieta and the Voice of Earth (baritone) commands: “Escutai-o!”
  (Listen to Him!). As Anchieta utters a few words, the newly converted
  Amerindians immediately start singing his Marian poems in Latin. While such
  miraculous conversion pervades the historical accounts on Anchieta—so much so
  that he was canonized in 2014—newer studies portray a more complex reality,
  where those who were not subject to conversion were tortured, enslaved, or
  killed. Thus, in paraphrasing Leo Treitler, this passage <i>demands</i>
  interpretation, as the act of “listening” to Anchieta during the “Indian
  pacification” had a high cost. The Tupinambá population was decimated from a
  thriving 100,000 in the sixteenth century to an almost complete annihilation
  at the end of the eighteenth century. Within this context, while Villa-Lobos’s
  work glorifies the conversion of the native Brazilians, it may also be the
  starting point for a broader discussion on the historical distrust between
  indigenous communities and Brazilian society at large.</p>
