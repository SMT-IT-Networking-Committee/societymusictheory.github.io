  <p>Scholarship on the swashbuckler genre from both film and film music studies
  focuses on its Classical Hollywood incarnation, with Errol Flynn vehicles
  scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold receiving the most attention. The genre’s
  understudied postwar period brought major changes, including expanding the
  range of female characters beyond that of the passive observer. Women joined
  the adventure, wielding pistols and rapiers and playing pirates and plucky
  “loose” women. And yet, the films were often torn between celebrating powerful
  women and punishing them for deviating from traditional feminine behavior.

  <p>I argue the fraught gender politics of the postwar swashbuckler
  destabilized techniques for representing gender in the leitmotivic score. As
  film music scholars have established, Classical Hollywood composers depended
  on gendered orchestration and musical styles to differentiate active male
  characters from their passive female love interests, sometimes representing
  women with love themes alone, but women becoming narrative agents in their own
  right exposed the limits of this system. I analyze three responses to this
  challenge from the early fifties. In his score for <i>At Sword’s Point</i>
  (1952), Roy Webb undercut the agency of the female hero by scoring her with a
  conventional love theme. Franz Waxman found a more progressive solution by
  composing both a heroic and a lyrical leitmotif for the titular character of
  <i>Anne of the Indies</i> (1951), recalling Korngold’s approach for <i>Captain
  Blood</i> (1935). Most radical was Walter Scharf’s score for <i>Buccaneer’s
  Girl</i> (1950), which uses jazz as the basis for the protagonist’s heroic
  theme.</p>
  <p>As this variety of approaches indicates, the leitmotivic score had
  difficulty absorbing the female swashbuckler. The gendered division between
  the public and the private sphere that formed its basis was contested in the
  years following World War II. The genre had gone stale by the fifties, but the
  postwar swashbuckler’s gender politics reflected contemporary concerns. At a
  time when many US American women faced pressure to abandon their wartime
  careers and redirect their energies toward the idealized suburban home, these
  ideologically conflicted films (and film scores) provided crucial spaces to
  imagine women in leadership positions and manage anxieties about changing
  gender roles. Saturday Morning <i>10</i>:<i>45</i>–<i>12</i>:<i>15</i></p>
