abstract: |
    <p>Despite Szymanowski’s declaration that the <i>Myths</i> (1915) for violin
    and piano were not “dramas” (Wightman 1999, 144), several scholars—including
    Palmer (1983), van Moere (2008), and Helman (2015)—have called for
    programmatic readings of “Narcissus.” To this I respond with a narrative
    analysis inspired by Freud’s (1914) conception of narcissism and Lewin’s
    (1986) discussion of perceptual loops in Husserl’s phenomenology. “Narcissus”
    depicts the self-obsessive and self-referential qualities of the titular
    narcissist through diverse musical means—imitative counterpoint, generative
    harmonies, inversional symmetry, and cyclic bass lines. The idiosyncratic
    sonata form highlights how Narcissus is tragically ensnared in a perceptual
    loop with his own
    reflection—Narcissus-watching-Reflection-watching-Narcissus-watching…ad
    infinitum—that can only be terminated with what Lewin dubs an “external
    call”—in our protagonist’s case, his death and transformation. Through my
    analysis, I further demonstrate how Szymanowski’s manipulation of sonata form
    and the tension between tonal and cyclic structures in “Narcissus” are core
    features of Szymanowski’s middle-period style.</p>
