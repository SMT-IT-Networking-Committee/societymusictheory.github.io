  <p>On 8 March 1782, in the mission village of Gnadenhütten, established by the
  Moravian church along the Tuscarawas river in the Ohio Country, ninety-six
  Delaware and Mohican Christians sang hymns as they were murdered at the hands
  of 160 Pennsylvania militiamen. Despite the multiple horrors of the
  massacre—one of the most violent events of the American Revolution—it was the
  singing of the Moravian Indians that lingered most powerfully in subsequent
  stories and histories. Moravian historians have argued that the singing of the
  Indian congregation during their final hours was definitive proof of their
  conversion to Christianity, since this was a common practice in German
  Moravian communities at the point of death. What many church historians and
  even outside scholars have failed to recognize in the singing of the Indian
  congregation at Gnadenhütten was the presence of an indigenized Christianity—a
  Delaware and Mohican Christianity articulated through song. By singing, not
  only had the Moravian Indians realized the German Moravian ideal of a
  spiritual death, but their songs had constituted their determination to keep
  their Indian identity. For Eastern Woodlands people, to have one’s song broken
  by torture or punishment meant losing one’s self. To sing in the face of
  impending death was to defy the Pennsylvania militiamen who brought such
  tremendous destruction and horror upon their community. While Moravian
  missionaries may have simply desired to preach the Gospel through their own
  particular style of sung Christian community articulated through hymnody, the
  process of becoming Moravian had allowed Indian Christians considerable space
  to develop indigenized forms of Christianity and music-making. Yet, it may
  have been the hybridity of these practices that ultimately rendered them as
  outsiders to both European Christian communities and Native communities in
  Pennsylvania and Ohio, and therefore particularly vulnerable to violence. The
  grim realities of the massacre at Gnadenhütten demand a careful examination of
  the dichotomies between the Moravian mission agenda and the ultimate fate of
  the Moravian Indian congregation. Had Moravian singing created a meaningful
  mode of indigenized Christian practice, or had it simply constituted another
  form of sonic colonization?</p>
