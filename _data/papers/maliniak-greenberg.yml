abstract: |
    <p>This study examines the evolution of concerto first-movement form in
    the 18th century through a diachronic approach, using empirical
    corpus-based data. Present-day scholarship examines 18th-century concertos
    either through the Vivaldian baroque ritornello lens, or the Mozartean
    classical hybrid ritornello-sonata one, resulting in two distinct notions.
    The emergence of the latter from the former is rarely commented upon in
    any depth. Here, we examine this process relying both on descriptions of
    form throughout the 18th century and on an extensive corpus study
    comprising 210 concertos, composed between 1711 and 1789. Through
    analyzing tutti-solo alternations, thematic recurrences and the tonal
    trajectory, we argue that the concerto transformed through two important
    trends: the growing importance of the solos, and the movement
    reorganization in larger-scale units beyond the textural division.
    Specifically, we demonstrate that the increase in the concerto movement
    length occurred through the expansion of the opening ritornello, and the
    first and last solos. The middle and final ritornellos received decreasing
    roles, eventually regulated to mere solo articulation. We also show that a
    final tonic recapitulatory section, initiated by the main theme around
    three-fourths through the movement, was a common concerto procedure early
    on.</p>
    <p>Although some of these trends have been noted both by contemporary
    (Quantz, Koch) and modern (Talbot, Caplin) theorists, the diachronic
    corpus-based approach presented here allows us to appreciate the process
    of change, to identify significant milestones during that process, and to
    provide a chronologically-sensitive framework for evaluating mid-century
    works on their own terms, rather than on those of Vivaldi or Mozart.</p>
