abstract: |
  <p>Few medieval manuscripts have generated more controversy than Cambridge
  University Library Gg.V.35: an eleventh-century miscellany from Saint
  Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury. The manuscript transmits a heterogeneous song
  collection known as the <i>Carmina cantabrigiensia</i> (or “Cambridge Songs”),
  whose origin and function have long been debated. The collection has
  alternately been described as the repertoire of a wandering goliard, a
  professional entertainer’s training manual, and a collection of songs prized
  primarily for their literary value, or conversely, for their musical
  qualities. Interpreting the collection in its wider manuscript context, Arthur
  Rigg and Gernot Wieland explained it as the final element in an array of
  pedagogical materials intended for classroom use and arranged in ascending
  order of difficulty. More recently, Jeremy Llewellyn contextualized the
  collection within the art of the medieval cantor, tracing the liturgical
  origins of the song CC44, <i>Hec est clara dies</i>, as a case study.</p>
  <p>The present study reexamines <i>Hec est clara dies</i> in light of newly
  identified concordances in a thirteenth-century processional from Wilton
  Abbey. I show how the song quotes the unique Wilton <i>Visitatio sepulchri</i>
  Easter play and other chants used in the Wilton liturgy. I furthermore
  demonstrate how other texts transmitted in the manuscript point to the
  influence of the Saint Amand Abbey school, and more specifically, to the
  school of Saint Bertin, founded by Hucbald of Saint-Amand. On this evidence, I
  propose that the Cambridge Songs were a collection belonging to the cantor,
  poet, composer, and teacher Goscelin, monk of Saint Bertin Abbey (ca.
  1040–1114). Goscelin served for some fifteen years as chaplain and tutor at
  Wilton Abbey before sojourning in various English religious houses as an
  itinerant hagiographer, and ultimately settling at Saint Augustine’s Abbey.
  This attribution harmonizes the various proposed origins and functions of the
  manuscript and explains seemingly contradictory evidence regarding the
  transmission of its song collection. Finally, it sheds new light on the
  growing body of hagiographic and liturgical works attributed to Goscelin, on
  the education of his students, and on the music and liturgy of Wilton
  Abbey.</p>
