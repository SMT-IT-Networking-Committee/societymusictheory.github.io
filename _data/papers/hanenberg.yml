  <p>Irregular-meter grooves define the sonic palettes of many progressive and
  alternative rock genres and artists. While recent scholarship has demonstrated
  the analytical value of studying metrically irregular rock music, common
  subdivision patterns and the instrumental cues that express them remain
  under-theorized. To better understand irregular rock grooves, I examine
  drumbeat articulations. By contrasting metrically irregular drumbeats with the
  standard 4/4 backbeat, the distinguishing features of different irregular
  grooves come into sharp focus. In this paper I present findings on the most
  common irregular meters—quintuple and septuple—within a corpus of 240 songs
  released since 1990. These two cardinalities are especially instructive as
  models for irregular patterning: each bears a distinct relationship to regular
  metric archetypes and reveals a characteristic approach to irregularity.</p>
  <p>Among quintuple patterns we find a multitude of subdivisional possibilities
  expressed through a variety of drumbeats. Of eight 5/4 drumbeat archetypes and
  two common 5/8 possibilities, most concern patternings of kick and snare drums
  that vary the standard rock backbeat. The representation of all ten of these
  archetypes in my corpus attests the diversity of quintuple grooves.
  Conversely, septuple patterns are strikingly consistent, imitating the
  backbeat more closely. Nearly half of the 7/4 grooves I surveyed begin with
  what could be construed as a 4/4 measure, with standard backbeat
  accompaniment, while 85% of 7/8 examples adopt the backbeat (with a recurring
  eighth-note deletion). Septuple grooves thus negotiate a space between the
  unpredictable irregularities of quintuple meters and the predictable
  regularity of the 4/4 backbeat.</p>
