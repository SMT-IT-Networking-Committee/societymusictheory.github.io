  <p>Though many theoretical measures of similarity rely on shared
  interval-class content, Tuire Kuusi has found that in experimental conditions,
  similarity judgements were also guided by a pitch setâ€™s degree of consonance,
  association with familiar sonorities, chord span, and the distribution of
  notes in pitch space. However, it remains unclear to what degree each of these
  properties contributes to the perceptual experience of <i>similarity</i>.
  Machine learning techniques such as linear regression can be used to create
  models that describe the relationship between the pitch set attributes
  identified by Kuusi and perceptual judgments collected experimentally. This
  presentation reports the results of an experiment in which listeners rated
  isolated pitch sets along five descriptive dimensions: smooth-rough,
  stable-volatile, clear-blurred, light-gloomy, and calm-irritable. Regression
  models were trained to fit values for the attributes identified by Kuusi to
  the average judgements of listeners. In addition to identifying the relative
  contribution of a particular feature to a verbal description, the models can
  also be used to predict values for pitch sets that were not directly tested.
  In this way, these regression models can be used as a similarity measure
  constructed from empirical data rather than theoretical intuitions. Cluster
  analysis of extrapolated data can be used to investigate how pitch sets group
  together and how well they accord to theories of set classes and set-class
  families.</p>
