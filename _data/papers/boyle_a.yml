    <p>Many analysts note an apparent paradox in the functions of repetition: it
    can create discontinuities at the boundaries of the repeated segment, but
    can also promote continuity in the form of a groove or ostinato (Lidov 2005,
    Margulis 2014). The first type, objectifying repetition, highlights the
    repeated material as a significant musical entity: it is foreground and is
    typically of formal or rhetorical importance to the work as a whole. In the
    second type, the repeated material itself (the ostinato) becomes subordinate
    to an ongoing metric process and typically plays a background role.
    Contemporary repetitive music often cultivates ambiguity between these dual
    functions for expressive purposes. My paper explores the textural
    manipulations arising from Harrison Birtwistle’s repetitions in two works,
    “Frieze 2” and “Frieze 3” from <i>Nine Movements for String Quartet</i>. I
    begin by describing generalized prototypes for the two repetition functions,
    drawing on and supplementing typologies by Middleton (1990), Lidov (2005),
    and Leydon (2002). Using these models, I show how Birtwistle’s brief
    “ostinati” combine characteristics of the two prototypes. I then show how a
    hidden, global chaconne in each movement embodies some of the same
    contradictions underlying the local repetitions. Thus, the same ambiguities
    of identity, continuity, and textural priority that animate local passages
    are also at the heart of Birtwistle’s larger forms.</p>
