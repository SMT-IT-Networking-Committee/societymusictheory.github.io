  <p><i>Swan Lake</i> concludes, the audience bursts into applause, and the
  prima ballerina lies dying in a pool of blood with a satisfied smile on her
  face. This is the shocking conclusion of <i>Black Swan</i> (2010), and close
  analysis reveals that Tchaikovsky is to blame in the demise of this young
  woman.</p>
  <p>Nina utterly fails to embody the passionate Black Swan role, and her
  desperation leads her down a dangerous path of mental dissociation. A dark
  alternate identity subsumes her over the course of ten dissociative episodes.
  Three <i>Swan Lake</i> numbers orchestrate all of these episodes, and she is
  eerily synchronized with the musical meter during these episodes, emerging
  disoriented and amnesic. Analysis of her metric entrainment will show that
  this music is metadiegetic, and that she is performing to the music she hears
  in her head without will or consciousness. This reveals an alternative
  narrative arc, evoking the pathological music discourse of the nineteenth
  century (in which decadent music was seen as a dangerous precipitant of
  psychological disease): this is <i>not</i> the story of a ballerina who
  perseveres through strength and determination, but a ballerina maneuvered and
  ultimately destroyed by Tchaikovsky. Young women were considered especially
  vulnerable to the deleterious effects of dissolute music, which had the power
  to “effectively hypnotize female listeners” (Kennaway 2012) and cause them to
  behave as “automaton[s] controlled by a foreign will” (Bernheim 1888). Like
  early hypnotists who utilized the steady beat of a metronome to access the
  subconscious, Tchaikovsky entrains Nina under his metric spell.</p>
