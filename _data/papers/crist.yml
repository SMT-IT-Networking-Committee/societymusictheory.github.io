abstract: |
  <p><i>Time Out</i> by the Dave Brubeck Quartet is one of the most commercially
  successful albums in the history of jazz, not far behind Miles Davis’s <i>Kind
  of Blue</i>. Both were recorded in the same year (1959) and location
  (Columbia’s 30th Street Studio). Davis’s album has received extensive
  scrutiny, including numerous articles and several monographs (Kahn, Nisenson,
  Williams). But there is no comparable body of work on Brubeck’s album, despite
  its ubiquitous presence in the American soundscape for more than a
  half-century.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I suggest that a close look at Brubeck’s <i>Time Out</i> as
  a sound document reveals not only a fascinating chapter in the history of
  recorded jazz but also new perspectives on American cultural history of the
  1950s and 60s. Drawing upon the holdings of the Brubeck Collection at the
  University of the Pacific and the archives of Teo Macero, the album’s
  producer, at the New York Public Library, I will detail the previously hidden
  connections between the track “Blue Rondo à la Turk” and the death of W.C.
  Handy (“Father of the Blues”); the genesis of “Strange Meadow Lark,” from its
  earliest compositional sketches to Miles Davis’s later interest in recording
  it; and the surprisingly extensive evolution of “Take Five,” as documented by
  the original session recordings.</p>
  <p>In addition, the story of <i>Time Out</i> involves an unexpectedly diverse
  cast of characters from many sectors of American and European musical and
  visual arts. For instance, the weekend preceding the album’s release, the
  Quartet performed at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic, under the
  direction of Leonard Bernstein. The concerts were attended by both the
  avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse, then in his seventies, and the young
  pioneer of free jazz, Ornette Coleman. Moreover, the painting that Brubeck
  wanted for the cover of <i>Time Out</i>, but had to be postponed until its
  sequel, was by the Catalan surrealist Joan Miró, and its use was brokered by
  Xenia Cage and Henri Matisse’s son, Pierre.</p>
