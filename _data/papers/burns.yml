abstract: |
  <p>In December 1927, Paris’s Maison Gaveau hosted a performance of works by
  Heitor Villa-Lobos, to great acclaim. A front-page review of the concert in the
  newspaper <i>L’Intransigeant</i> noted especially a series of three songs for
  orchestra and voice. <i>Trois poêmes indiens</i> sparked much gawking in
  Europe, highlighting a tale of Villa-Lobos’s capture by Amerindian Brazilian
  “cannibals,” his rescue by heroic whites, and his eventual return to urban life
  with the fruits of “jungle” music.</p>
  <p>The story is surely apocryphal, but the works, later arranged for piano and
  voice and published with the Portuguese title <i>Tres poêmas indigenas</i>
  (1929), shed light on a very real cultural-historical process. Villa-Lobos was
  no collector-champion: two of the texts on which the songs were based had
  previously been published with melodies in ethnographic volumes, and the other
  was newly written by Villa-Lobos’s modernist colleague Mário de Andrade. Yet
  Villa-Lobos’s songs are at pains to define and make use of indigenous Brazilian
  identity. And they do so in a particular way, inscribing indigeneity and
  modernism together into contemporary Brazilian nationalism.</p>
  <p>Over the course of the three songs, Villa-Lobos uses increasing pitch
  resources and expanded internal contrast to create a progressive image of
  Amerindian music-making, one that begins with a narrow pitch collection and
  ostinati and ends with a more lied-like approach to text-music relations.
  Villa-Lobos not only takes advantage of Brazilian urban Indianist fantasies,
  but also redefines indigeneity as something expansive, an innate trait of
  <i>brasilidade</i> (Brazilian-ness) that can include even the most modern and
  urban of texts, as long as they draw upon themes perceived to be related to
  indigeneity.</p>
  <p>Using the score, its performance history, and reception, I take <i>Tres
  poêmas indigenas</i> as a case study in composition’s exposure to intertwining
  pressures of exoticism, modernism, and nationalism. Villa-Lobos’s embrace of
  distant, primitive indigeneity made for good fortune on foreign shores. But it
  also served a domestic project in which indigeneity was cast as integral to
  national identity. From these songs, I also connect to broader discussions of
  the relationship between indigeneity and nationalism and of the foreign and
  domestic consumption of Amerindian caricatures.</p>
