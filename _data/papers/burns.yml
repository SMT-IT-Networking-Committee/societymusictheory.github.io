abstract: |
    <p>Theory curricula are shaped not only by the perceived needs of our
    students, but also by pressures—both real and imagined—to produce students
    that exhibit competency in the rules of voice-leading, phrase structure,
    and other concepts that are traditionally taught in conservatories and
    schools of music. Central to these competencies is the mastery of
    chorale-style writing and its attendant voice-leading rules. In this brief
    talk, I address the pressures, labor costs, and anxieties that constrain
    attempts to decentralize chorale-style writing in the undergraduate
    curriculum.</p>
    <p>Internally, one must fit within a cohesive departmental curriculum.
    More broadly, textbook norms and common curricular practices across
    schools provide self-reinforcing standards for what music is and how
    musicians should understand it—a lingua franca of musicianship, one which
    currently includes skills in SATB part-writing. Moreover, any curricular
    changes de-emphasizing SATB materials also impose hidden labor costs on
    instructors. To move away from textbook norms, faculty must construct new
    materials and reconfigure existing ones, a significant task that reduces
    time for other activities that are necessary to one’s job. Such changes
    also compel theory instructors to reconsider their skills as pedagogues: a
    shift away from chorales likely involves moving away from their own
    undergraduate training, and thus acquiring new skills.</p>
    <p>As we consider decentralizing SATB activities, we must take into
    account that instructors deploying changes bear costs and face anxieties
    and pressures from ourselves, our departments, and our peer
    institutions.</p>
