    <p>Recognizing both the low rate of female performance in heavy metal bands—globally at the level of 3% (Berkers &amp; Schaap 2018)—and the dearth of music analysis for extreme vocal expression (Smialek 2015), this study analyzes the work of a female vocalist from the genre of progressive metal: Tatiana Schmailyuk of the band Jinjer. My analysis of Jinjer’s song and video, “Pit of Consciousness” (<em>Macro</em>, 2019), yields data that places lyrical and visual subjectivity into interpretive dialogue with musical materials and expression. Using this case-study approach, I focus on two research objectives: 1) to analyze the performance expression of a female extreme metal vocalist; and 2) to illustrate a multimodal analytic model for music video.</p>
    <p>Metal scholarship affirms the genre to be dominated by male performers (Walser 1993; Weinstein 2000) and points to the preponderance of patriarchal values, with the performance content contributing to an aesthetic production of misogyny, power, and intensity (Barron 2007; Overell 2013, 2014; Rafalovich 2006; Walser 1993; Weinstein 1991, 2009). The notion of heavy metal as a hegemonic discourse exhibiting hypermasculinity (Walser 1993) has been queried by recent scholars who reveal metal to support a range of gendered and sexualized subjectivities (Clifford-Napoleone 2015; Kahn-Harris 2007).</p>
    <p>This paper illustrates a systematic methodology for identifying and interpreting cross-modal expression and aesthetics in words, music, and images. Ultimately, the selected vocalist is shown to claim space and articulate an alternative femininity through concrete effects that challenge norms of gender and genre.</p>
