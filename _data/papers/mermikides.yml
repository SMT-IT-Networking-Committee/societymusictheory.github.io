    <p>This paper presents an overview of existing research – and offers novel
    perspectives - on expressive micro rhythm; the salient ‘deviations’ from
    the conventional lattice of rhythmic notation. Long advocated by
    practitioner-educators such as Mingus and Crook, this hugely important
    component of jazz expression and virtuosity is often obfuscated by unclear
    and contradictory terminology, and the welcome adoption of digital
    technology in its precise calculation remains largely in the realm of
    post-hoc description rather than offering practical implications in
    performance and pedagogy. However, recent developments in digital
    technology and our understanding of rhythmic performance and perception
    have created an excellent opportunity to improve research in this field.
    Original software is presented that engages with a range of micro-timing
    and micro- rhythmic analytical frameworks (from Mingus, Benadon,
    Butterfield, London, Biles to Mermikides) and with pre-recorded material
    as well as real-time performance. These rhythmic mechanics can be heard to
    operate on multiple musical time levels from the hyper-measure down to the
    tatum. The ‘feedback metronome’ demonstrated offers new analytical
    approaches as well as pedagogical opportunities that reconsider the
    metronome’s role in jazz learning, and our appreciation and understanding
    of this important but often under-represented feature of jazz virtuosity.
    New analyses of Coltrane performances are also presented including swing
    ratios of ride cymbal patterns, micro-rhythmic permutations in
    <i>Acknowledgment</i>, plasticity of ensemble grooves in <i>Mr.
    Knight</i>, and the use of hypermetric rotation.</p>
