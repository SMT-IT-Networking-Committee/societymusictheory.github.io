    <p>Discussing the repudiation of hierarchical forms in non-tonal music, Robert Fink (2001) remarks on composers who adopted forms derived from visual arts, such as collage, for achieving coherence in formal “flatness.” A few, such as Iannis Xenakis and Luigi Nono, were inspired by visual principles and proportions from architecture and painting respectively, which they transformed into music (Sterken 2007, Guerrero 2010). This paper introduces another strategy—shared by Morton Feldman and Caroline Shaw—for re-presenting spaces through embodied experience. </p>
    <p>Each movement in Shaw’s <em>Plan and Elevation</em> depicts a garden in the Dumbarton Oaks estate. For example, “The Ellipse” is inspired by the eponymous garden’s structure and Shaw’s experience walking there, which she likens to Kierkegaardian “infinite repetition.” The movement’s narrative is generated by a musical subject (Monahan’s (2013) individuated element): an ostinato that gradually transforms, through a changing rhythmic, harmonic, and timbral environment, to a large-scale gesture, in a process illustrating repetition as self-transcendence (Kemp 2015). Feldman’s <em>Rothko Chapel</em> expresses the chapel’s physical structure only vaguely, but a narrative emerges from the viola’s repeated declamations, which, expressing a musical subject, interact with choral and percussive soundscapes inspired by the chapel paintings’ variations of textures and hues.</p>
    <p>Shaw’s and Feldman’s works are starkly different, yet they both rely on musical subjects in expressing their source-spaces as experienced by the composers. While Xenakis’s and Nono’s schematic approaches encapsulate visual principles through mathematical proportions, I argue that musical subjects allow listeners to Shaw’s and Feldman’s works to experience the spaces’ aesthetic and stylistic features.  </p>
