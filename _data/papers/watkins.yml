abstract: |
  <p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Jesuit missionaries in what
  is now southern Paraguay, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina developed a
  system of thirty mission towns (<i>reducciónes</i>) devoted to Christianizing
  Guaraní Indians. In addition to introducing them to Christian religious
  concepts, Jesuits taught the Guaraní to sing plainchant and polyphony, and to
  build and play European instruments.</p>
  <p>A frieze high on the walls of the chancel and transept of the main church
  (constructed between 1739 and 1764) in the ruins of the mission of Santísima
  Trinidad in Paraguay consists in part of angels playing musical instruments.
  While these instruments are overwhelmingly European, some of the angels appear
  to be carrying objects that several scholars have interpreted as Guaraní
  rattles known as <i>mbaraká</i>. They resemble <i>mbaraká</i> to some degree,
  but identifying these objects as such has neglected the larger iconographic
  context of the frieze, which includes representations of the Madonna and Child
  and angels carrying thuribles—liturgical implements in which to burn incense.
  </p>
  <p>In this paper I argue on the basis of the iconographic context, records of
  musical instruments in the Guaraní reducciónes, the shamanic nature of the
  <i>mbaraká</i>, and specific aspects of the disputed objects’ visual
  appearance, that they were intended by the indigenous craftsmen who fashioned
  the frieze and by the Jesuits who supervised those craftsmen, to represent not
  <i>mbaraká</i>, but rather aspergillums—Christian liturgical implements used
  to sprinkle holy water—and thus fit seamlessly into a depiction of heavenly
  worship, reflected in the earthly music and liturgy of the Jesuits and their
  indigenous congregation. Despite their intended identity as aspergillums,
  however, the general shape of the objects, specific location in the frieze,
  and association with supernatural power would have permitted a reading by the
  indigenous congregation as <i>mbaraká</i>, allowing for a syncretic
  interpretation by the Guaraní in ways that fused European and indigenous
  identities and practices and, moreover, projected that syncretic identity into
  the heavenly realms. </p>
