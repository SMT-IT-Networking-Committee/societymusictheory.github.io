    <p>On Easter Sunday 2018, <i>Jesus Christ Superstar </i>(<i>JCS</i>) was
    broadcast on NBC as a live musical television special, directed by David
    Leveaux and Alex Rudzinski, starring John Legend (Jesus), Sara Bareilles
    (Mary), and Brandon Victor Dixon (Judas). <i>JCS</i> first debuted as a
    staged musical in 1971, and was turned into a film production in 1973, which
    premiered to critical acclaim. In 2000, Gale Edwards and Nick Morris
    directed a film production of <i>JCS</i> in which the style of singing
    harkened to other Broadway works, rather than to the original 1970s rock
    aesthetic. Even with the differences in musical style, stage production, and
    character choice, both film productions maintain a distinct homosocial
    sensibility, often crossing into homoeroticism. The differences in these two
    films do not allow the viewer to simply ignore the intersections of racial
    and gender politics at play. Ted Neeley’s interpretation of Jesus in <i>JCS
    </i>1973 evokes a “performance” of straightness, particularly in his
    intimacy with, but ultimate rejection of Judas Iscariot (Carl Anderson).
    This version illustrates the distinct and precarious positionality of the
    early 1970s white and black gay man in contending with the pressure to
    conform to heteronormativity. Furthermore, this version alludes to the fear
    of miscegenation covertly ingrained in the American twentieth-century
    imaginary, pitting a white Jesus against a black Judas. <i>JCS</i> 2000
    seems to take homosociality and homoeroticism for granted, with a Judas
    (Jérome Pradon) who is not tortured by his homoerotic desire, but rather,
    distressed by his lack of authority over Jesus (Glenn Carter). In this
    paper, I will look at three scenes from both film productions and proceed to
    utilize critical race theory and the practice of queering in analyzing the
    lead characters. Ultimately, in comparing these two film productions and
    analyzing the actors’ interpretation of their characters, I argue that both
    of these productions of <i>JCS, </i>although aesthetically disparate, are
    constrained by white heteropatriarchy.</p>
