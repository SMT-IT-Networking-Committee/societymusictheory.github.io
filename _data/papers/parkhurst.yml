  <p>Acknowledgment of some sort of Schenker-Hegel connection is common<i>
  </i>in the exegetical literature on Schenker. In this paper, I contend that
  Hegel himself would have been unlikely to discern “the Hegelian slant of
  Schenker’s theory” (Street 1989, 86). This conjecture is corroborated in part
  by Hegel’s <i>Aesthetics</i>, which defends the decidedly un-Schenkerian
  position that music is a referential art form that signifies “inner life”
  (Hegel 1975/2, 795). But even more importantly, I argue, the music-analytical
  program that Schenker carries out in his mature works, which involves
  advancing piece-internal explanations of specific musical matters of fact, is
  a project that Hegel explicitly <i>excludes</i> from the remit of
  “philosophical science.” For Hegel, all that dialectical philosophy can
  accomplish is to retrospectively order and systematize the findings of the
  “special sciences”; dialectics cannot explain particular states of affairs
  (such as the unique design of an individual work of music). If Schenkerian
  analysis is in fact an “adaptation of Hegelian dialectics” (Cherlin 1988),
  therefore, it is not an especially Hegelian adaptation.</p>
  <p>After drawing this negative conclusion, I offer a positive characterization
  of how to be a Hegelian about music theory. In short, the idea is that
  properly Hegelian music-theoretical inquiry would not (and could not) be
  directed toward explaining pieces; instead, it would have to explain the
  origins and function of the <i>social practice</i> of explaining pieces.
  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this leads me to say a few (perhaps surprising) things
  about Moritz Hauptmann, the “Hegelian music theorist” (Bent 1994, 56). </p>
