    <p>When learning outcomes are framed independently of a particular
    repertoire, music theory syllabi can comfortably accommodate musical
    diversity. Essays by Tenzer and Clendinning, responding to recent
    disciplinary deliberations, have suggested some ways to include
    “non-canonical” world music in the classroom, but more can be done. There
    are many good reasons to expose university students to diverse music, but
    it seems especially important for them to learn basic principles that many
    musics share.</p>
    <p>In a first-year theory course I teach, we consider how pulse and meter,
    grouping structure and functions, pitch focus and hierarchy, and voice
    interactions in various textures can shape musical time. The syllabus
    provides a basis for analyzing “canonical” tonal and post-tonal repertoire
    covered in later courses, but it also supports close hearings of
    “non-canonical” music. Indeed, in the latter, fundamental rhythmic and
    melodic processes are often more salient than in art- or popular-music
    textures governed by harmonic and contrapuntal constraints.</p>
    <p>In this talk I discuss how three examples of world music contribute to
    this pedagogical program: a layered Balinese gamelan cycle, a zither-flute
    duet from the Chinese silk-and-bamboo repertoire, and a melody played by a
    Bolivian panpipe orchestra. Although they originate in cultural contexts
    unfamiliar to most students, they are readily accessible. And they all
    employ the basic processes I cover in the course, often through strikingly
    similar procedures, such as interlocking patterns, melodic elaboration,
    motivic transformation, and collectional completion. Appreciating these
    shared procedures will help students understand the music(s) they
    eventually choose to concentrate on.</p>
