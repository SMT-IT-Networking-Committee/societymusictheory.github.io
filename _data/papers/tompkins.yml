abstract: |
    <p>This paper presents a corpus study that identifies the number of
    statistically distinct modes used in sacred and secular genres from
    1400â€“1750. Corpora used for the study include Masses, motets, and secular
    songs from the Franco-Flemish School, works by Palestrina, secular Italian
    songs with alfabeto guitar tablature from the early seventeenth century,
    and works by J.S. Bach. K-means clustering of key profiles are used to
    determine the number of distinguishable modes in each corpus. The results
    of this study show that the number of modes present in a corpus depends
    not only on date of publication but also on the genre of a composition.
    Secular genres are more likely to cluster into two modes while sacred
    genres cluster into several modes. This paper also explores the
    differences between systems of notation and musical practice and suggests
    other ways in which machine learning techniques can be in dialogue with
    the study of harmonic practice in early music.</p>
