title: "Beyond Intoxication: On Sobering Experiences of Electronic Dance Music"

abstract: |
  <p>Since the early 1990s, philosophical approaches to electronic dance music
  (EDM) have privileged intoxication. Appearing in various theoretical guises,
  intoxication has drugged our thinking and contributed to an orthodox,
  quasi-monist philosophy of EDM. In this vein, ravers surrender themselves to
  “Dionysian pleasure” (Melechi 1993: 32) and experience “forgetfulness,
  selflessness, and oblivion” (Gauthier 2004: 69). Lost within the
  socio-chemical-musical assemblage of the rave, dancers assume an
  undifferentiated oneness akin to a Deleuze-Guattarian Body-without-Organs
  (Jordan 1995). All semiotic structures are digested and Baudrillard’s
  hyperreal singularity reigns supreme at acid-fueled psytrance parties (Vitos
  2010; 2017). <i>Ekstasis</i> dances freely (e.g. Gilbert & Pearson 1999) as a
  black-boxed buzzword. In music theoretical work, EDM’s temporal infinity
  produces intoxicating process pleasure (Garcia 2005) and flow (Butler
  2014).</p>
  <p>This paper provides an antidote to the above by considering North American
  dubstep post-2010 in the company of Adorno. Drawing upon fieldwork at Spring
  Awakening Music Festival (Chicago, Ill., 9–11 June 2017) and Lost Lands Music
  Festival (Thornville, Oh., 29 September–1 October 2017), I demonstrate that
  many festivalgoers are addicted to the sobering experience of the dubstep drop
  (a musical fetish defined by explicitness). I problematize abstraction,
  oneness and forgetfulness by arguing that the drop choreographs a grave
  awareness of self and an intense interrogation of others. I then focus on the
  online reception of dubstep tracks such <i>Drowning </i>by Excision with
  reference to Adorno’s emotional listener. In the final part of the paper I
  consider dubstep’s preoccupation with “hype” alongside Adorno’s conception of
  self-conscious hysteria.</p>
