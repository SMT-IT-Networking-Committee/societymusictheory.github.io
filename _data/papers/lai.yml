abstract: |
    <p>This paper explores a particular kind of interaction between metrical
    dissonance and phrase rhythm in Schubert’s sonata forms. By integrating
    theoretical concepts derived from Harald Krebs with the model of sonata
    form developed by James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, I explore how metrical
    dissonance and “hypermetric subliminal dissonance”—a type of phrase rhythm
    that is specifically associated with the subliminal dissonance—can be
    heard to shape the structures and processes of Schubert’s sonatas. To
    demonstrate such interaction between metrical dissonance and phrase rhythm
    in sonata form, this paper analyzes the first movements of three
    instrumental works by Schubert: the Piano Sonata in E Minor, D. 566; the
    Piano Trio in E-flat Major, D. 929; and the Piano Sonata in C Minor, D.
    958.</p>
    <p>These works share three strategies of metrical dissonance: to
    articulate formal boundaries, to expand and so loosen a theme, and to
    destabilize progressions that lead to structural cadences. Meanwhile, I
    argue that the particular metrical dissonances used in these pieces
    proceed in tandem with the teleological trajectories of tonality
    characteristic of sonata form.</p>
    <p>In sum, this study contributes to a growing literature on temporal
    relationships in music of the early 19th century (Hyland 2016; Krebs 1999
    and 2014; VonFoerster 2011). Apart from its examination of metrical
    dissonance, this study also seeks to fill a gap in our understanding of
    the relationship between phrase rhythm and sonata form in Schubert’s
    music, a relationship that has been substantially investigated in other
    repertoires (Ng 2012; Rothstein 1989; Temperley 2008).</p>
