abstract: | 
    <p>Fans of the experimental hip hop trio clipping. (<em>sic</em>) laud the intricately crafted sonic narratives that play out over the course of their songs and albums—so much so that two of their albums have recently been nominated as finalists in the Dramatic Presentation category for the prestigious Hugo Science Fiction Awards, a category in which a musical album had not been nominated since 1971. I point out that their aural narratives often incorporate “diegetic” sound into the production that accompanies rapped verses—that is, the production often includes sounds that have a clear causal root in the events being described in the lyrics. I argue that listening through the traditions of film sound, radio drama, and hip hop sketches provides paths better suited to understanding clipping.’s compelling stories than traditional music-theoretical approaches to musical narrative.</p>
    <p>With analysis of two songs, I explore the complexities made possible by clipping.’s sonic and narrative strategies and demonstrate the utility of the diegetic framework. In both “Get Up” and “Run For Your Life,” sounds that are unambiguously diegetic at the outset become increasingly untethered from narrative “reality.” I conclude by suggesting that these uncanny sound worlds offer more immersive narrative experiences, but also problematize the easy, voyeuristic way in which listeners of this music might fetishize the violent stories being told.</p>
