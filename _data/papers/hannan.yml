abstract: |
    <p>The music of the math metal band Car Bomb gives rise to multiple, often incommensurate rhythmic realities for different listeners. I call this phenomenon “rhythmic parallax.” Even basic rhythmic features—such as pulse and tactus—are often radically different depending on listeners’ purposes. I explore four perspectives on various moments from the song “Blackened Battery,” those of (1) a casual listener, (2) the band members while composing, (3) the band members while performing, and (4) a transcriber using software that measures the recording against clock time. Examining the different interpretations that arise from these perspectives provides a novel method for rhythmic analysis, one that cuts across habitual boundaries between metric analysis, microtiming analysis, and discussion of embodiment. I suggest that an analysis that focuses on rhythmic parallax reflects the difficulties, complexities, and apparent contradictions of music temporality.</p>
