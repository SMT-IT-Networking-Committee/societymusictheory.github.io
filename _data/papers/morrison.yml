abstract: |
  <p>Beginning with the International Copyright Act of 1891 through the first
  revision of the US federal Copyright Act in 1909, this paper will consider how
  ideas of intellectual property developed in the nineteenth century did not
  acknowledge the creative and cultural productions of African Americans in the
  making of the popular music industry. Through the concept of
  <i>Blacksound</i>, I will explore how the embodiment of the sounds produced in
  blackface throughout the nineteenth century informed the construction of
  racial identities and continued to resonate throughout formation of the
  <i>music industrial complex</i>. Specifically, I will consider how the sounds
  developed by mostly white male performers in early blackface performance—based
  on both “imagined” and real sounds of African Americans—continued to resonate
  and shift throughout popular music history, even after the disappearance of
  the blackface mask and gradual inclusion of non-white men and women on the
  popular stage during the Jim Crow era.</p>
  <p>A central case of study will be the popular tune “Ta Ra Ra Boom De
  Ay”—first published in 1891 and eventually claimed in a UK court case to
  belong to the “public domain.” The song originated with famed African American
  entertainer, Ma Ma Lou, in a late-nineteenth-century St. Louis sporting house
  and serves as an example of how the sounds and performance practices of black
  musicians moved from regional to commercial popularity without afforded rights
  and royalties. To complement the analysis of this non-recorded performance, I
  will provide an analysis of selected blackface 1890s publications by the
  Witmark & Sons publishing house, one of the most influential architects of the
  early popular music industry. As this paper will show, these cases set the
  stage—through performance, copyright laws, and the racialization of
  Intellectual (Performance) Property—for how Tin Pan Alley musicians, along
  with mechanical and music performing rights organizations, used Blacksound as
  the basis of popular music, as it shaped the sounds of records, radio, film,
  and other emerging technologies of popular entertainment.</p>
