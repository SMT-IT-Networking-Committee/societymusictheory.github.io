    <p>This presentation will examine the musical impact of computer programs
    developed in the eighties at the Parisian Institut de Recherche et
    Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), tracing their influence on
    post-spectral composition through an analysis of Kaija Saariaho’s early
    electronic works: <i>Vers le blanc </i>(1982, tape), <i>Jardin secret I</i> /
    <I>II</I> (1984–86, tape alone/ harpsichord and tape), and <I>IO</I> (1987,
    large ensemble with tape and live electronics). These works mark Saariaho's
    entry into computer-based music, as well as her stylistic turn toward French
    spectralism, offering a unique perspective on the composer’s initial
    development of techniques that have since been acknowledged as hallmarks of
    her mature style. Detailed analyses illuminate three key aspects of Saariaho’s
    compositional approach, including her use of interpolation systems to create
    continuous processes of transformation, her organization of individual musical
    parameters into multidimensional networks, and her construction of timbres
    based on the analysis of acoustic phenomena. Drawing on extensive archival
    documentation, I show how these techniques arise from the affordances of
    contemporaneous IRCAM technologies (CHANT, FORMES, and IANA), which Saariaho
    used to progressively formalize her musical thought within the crystalline
    confines of a customized program dubbed “transkaija.” Through an excavation of
    the underlying code for this program, this paper reconstructs musical
    processes that lie at the heart of the aforementioned works, revealing the
    extent to which technological mediation contributed to Saariaho’s early
    development as a post-spectral composer.</p>
