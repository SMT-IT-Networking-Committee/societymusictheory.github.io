title: "Playing with Shadows: The Reinjection Loop in Georg Friedrich Haas's Live-Elektronische Musik"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>The music of Austrian composer Georg Friedrich Haas is often grouped
    within the loose generic bounds of spectralism, but the composer dismisses
    this overly narrow characterization; instead, he positions his work at the
    intersection of several compositional approaches [Haas 2007]. Recent
    scholarship seems to support this view, suggesting that Haas’s music can be
    understood as a dramatic confrontation between “clashing harmonic systems”
    [Hasegawa 2015]. Building on these observations, this paper focuses on Haas’s
    recent endeavors in the domain of <i>live-elektronische Musik</i>, showing how
    the composer deploys a relatively straightforward technical procedure—the
    reinjection loop, or the delayed playback of recorded sound at various
    speeds—to juxtapose different modes of pitch organization, including
    twelve-tone temperament, microtonality, and just intonation. In <i>Ein
    Schattenspiel</i> (2004) for solo piano, recorded material is consistently
    played back at an accelerated ratio of 33/32, producing a quartertone system
    that recalls Ivan Wyschnegradsky’s <i>ultrachromatisme</i> and <i>espaces non
    octaviant</i>. By contrast, materials in <i>String Quartet No.4</i> (2003) are
    reinjected in a stop-and-go manner at different speeds, yielding fluid pitch
    relationships between the performers and live electronics: just-intoned
    harmonies clash with near-octave sonorities, twelve-tone melodies are
    harmonized with overtone spectra, and at times, indeterminacy throws the music
    open to chance. In these works, the reinjection loop functions on multiple
    levels, bringing the performers into contact with their immediate pasts, but
    also bringing Haas into dialogue with the long-cast shadows of his own musical
    predecessors, sparking a conflation of historical memory as various strains of
    influence collide in a musical pastiche.</p>
