abstract: |
  <p>In May 1963, on the eve of the Mills College festival celebrating Darius
  ;wa
  Milhaud’s seventieth birthday, organizer Nathan Rubin told the campus
  newspaper that the four-day event would explore the “paradoxical relationship
  between youth and age.” Though centered on Milhaud, a professor of composition
  at Mills since 1940, the festival programming extended back through the French
  tradition to Rameau, Josquin, and Machaut, while also featuring a day-long
  presentation of music by “young Americans” such as Milton Babbitt, Earle
  Brown, and Mills faculty member Morton Subotnick. The premiere of Milhaud’s
  <i>Suite de quatrains</i>, which incorporates elements of indeterminacy,
  showed a composer actively engaging with his reputation as a former innovator.
  More than a commemoration of a distinguished colleague, then, the
  festival—subtitled “The Age of Youth”—filtered the French past and the
  American present through the prism of Milhaud’s long transnational career.</p>
  <p>Drawing on material from the Mills College archives and a documentary
  produced for San Francisco television, this paper interprets the 1963 Milhaud
  Festival as the product of a musical community in which the French composer’s
  local significance had come to shape overarching views of music’s past,
  present, and future. For the Bay Area musical establishment, Milhaud’s
  international reputation and ongoing compositional activity brought the
  prestige of the French classical tradition to the region. But for Rubin,
  Subotnick, and others invested in contemporary music, it was the avant-garde
  Milhaud of the early 1920s who offered historical precedent for a new
  generation of American rebels and experimenters. Through his own involvement
  in the festival and commentary in the documentary, Milhaud mediated between
  these external perspectives while expressing careful skepticism about the new
  claims to his legacy. Although this renewed interest in his early career
  granted legitimacy in the postwar era, it also threatened to relegate him to
  the past while he was still alive, and to position “the young Americans” as
  the true heirs of the interwar Parisian avant-garde. Indeed, the tensions and
  contradictions manifested in this local festival speak to broader processes of
  dialogue and reinterpretation among successive generations of modernist
  artists.</p>
