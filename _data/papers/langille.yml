        <p>BMus (Honours Music Theory, Composition), MA (Music Theory), MISt (Library and Archives), McGill University</p>
        <p>Originally a jazz saxophonist, Brenna studied classical music both in undergraduate and graduate school at McGill University with interests in early music analysis, late nineteenth century chromaticism, and temperament and tuning systems. Her master’s thesis is on form independent of text in Monteverdi’s Fourth Book of Madrigals. Brenna started learning swing dances, including tap, at Cat’s Corner Dance Studio in Montreal following the completion of her first master’s degree. Due to this new-found interest, Brenna’s recent research has been on investigating rhythm and form in tap dance with a particular focus on the influences of African American vernacular dances on jazz as an artform and the rhythms of Eddie Brown. Her recent work in the field of information studies has been largely focused on critical information literacy and new ways in which to provide information services for both the public and academic communities. One of Brenna’s more recent projects includes an open-access subject guide to aid in the research of the history and culture of African American vernacular dances originating from the swing era, which will be published at the beginning of November by the Tap Legacy Foundation.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>The relationship between jazz music and dance stems all the way back to the origins of jazz itself (Harker 2008; Stearns 1994). In fact, in the swing era the two would be more easily understood as one combined artform (Harker 2008; Dodge 1995). Indeed, the oral histories of many of the jazz greats credit their own experiences and collaboration with dance as vital to their development as musicians as well as jazz music as a whole (Cole 1980; Harris 2019; Hentoff 1995; Stearns 1994). That said, vernacular jazz dance has lacked attention from jazz studies both in the pursuit of history and analysis (Harker 2008).</p>
    <p>In this paper I shall approach this issue through providing an analysis of a tap routine, Eddie Brown’s BS Chorus, and its relationship to two different jazz standards. Through analyzing a routine that is intended to be performed to a variety of jazz pieces, we can observe how a percussion piece with its own form and set of musical expectations can interact with music that may run with, or counter, to these formal divisions, thus influencing the interpretation of the piece itself. As existing scholarship has pointed out, our reliance on harmonic and melodic relationships have often been favored over rhythmic and metric interpretations of the music (Hasty 1997). By analyzing tap, we can not only have a more historically-informed understanding of jazz as an artform, but also provide new approaches to understanding the rhythmic and metric structure of music.</p>
