    <p>The relationship between jazz music and dance stems all the way back to the origins of jazz itself (Harker 2008; Stearns 1994). In fact, in the swing era the two would be more easily understood as one combined artform (Harker 2008; Dodge 1995). Indeed, the oral histories of many of the jazz greats credit their own experiences and collaboration with dance as vital to their development as musicians as well as jazz music as a whole (Cole 1980; Harris 2019; Hentoff 1995; Stearns 1994). That said, vernacular jazz dance has lacked attention from jazz studies both in the pursuit of history and analysis (Harker 2008).</p>
    <p>In this paper I shall approach this issue through providing an analysis of a tap routine, Eddie Brown’s BS Chorus, and its relationship to two different jazz standards. Through analyzing a routine that is intended to be performed to a variety of jazz pieces, we can observe how a percussion piece with its own form and set of musical expectations can interact with music that may run with, or counter, to these formal divisions, thus influencing the interpretation of the piece itself. As existing scholarship has pointed out, our reliance on harmonic and melodic relationships have often been favored over rhythmic and metric interpretations of the music (Hasty 1997). By analyzing tap, we can not only have a more historically-informed understanding of jazz as an artform, but also provide new approaches to understanding the rhythmic and metric structure of music.</p>
