title: "Re-Reading Mozart’s Keyboard Sonata in A Major, K. 331: Text, Audience, <i>Werkbegriff</i>"

abstract: |
  <p>The differences between the autographs and first editions of Mozart’s
  keyboard sonatas and their consequences for our understanding of Mozart’s
  works have been a long debated problem in Mozart scholarship. Many scholars,
  including the editors of the <i>Neue Mozart Ausgabe</i>, surmise that the
  first editions were “probably or possibly proof-read by Mozart” (NMA,
  editorial guidelines) and suggest that there is only one work and, hence, only
  one text. Other scholars have criticized this type of <i>Urtext</i> based on a
  mixture of sources as an “abstract, artificial fabrication” (e.g., Wolff,
  1998) and called for a more differentiated philological approach than to add
  up all recorded versions of a work into one total.</p>
  <p>In my paper I shed new light on this debate by analyzing two new sources
  for the Sonata in A Major, K. 331—the autograph bifolio discovered in Budapest
  in 2015 and a hitherto unknown, early manuscript copy that appeared on an
  auction in Munich in 2017. I show how the Munich copy corroborates the notion
  that the sonata in its autograph version was already distributed and performed
  in Mozart’s inner circle of family, friends, and students long before the
  first edition. Thus I disprove the common theory (e.g., Rampe, 1995) that the
  autograph constituted merely a draft to be completed in the first edition.
  Moreover, I present documentary evidence that strongly suggests that Mozart
  was only marginally—if at all—involved in the publication process of the
  sonata. As a result, I contend that the traditional <i>Werkbegriff</i> is
  indeed not applicable to K. 331, but that the sonata exists in two separate
  manifestations motivated by a shift in target audience. I therefore argue that
  a <i>Werkedition</i> yielded by a mixture of sources does not do justice to
  Mozart’s text and the historical realities of the sonata. Instead, I propose
  to apply the “versioning” approach in which autograph and first edition retain
  their historic integrities. I illustrate the implementation of this method in
  my own new edition of K. 331 (Kassel: Bärenreiter, 2017), which allows for a
  completely new perspective on a well-known piece.</p>
