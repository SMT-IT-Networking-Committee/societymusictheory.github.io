abstract: |
  <p>In “The Secret Programme of the Lyric Suite” (1977), George Perle proposed
  that both Alban and Helene Berg were complicit in fabricating the myth of a
  perfect marriage, which Perle later found relevant to Helene’s prohibition of
  the completion of her husband’s last work, the opera <i>Lulu</i>. Perle asks
  about Helene: “Ought we not to inquire into her mind and character?” But
  precisely this inquiry has been hampered by a lack of reliable sources and
  diverted by speculation about secret meaning in Berg’s music relating to
  extra-marital affairs, in particular that with Hanna Fuchs-Robettin. The
  availability today of new sources, including the edition of the complete
  existing correspondence between the Bergs, Helene’s unpublished letter
  exchanges with Soma Morgenstern, Willi Reich, Erwin Stein, and Erwin Ratz among
  others, and additional personal papers in the Austrian National Library, allows
  for a more authoritative and nuanced investigation into Helene Berg’s thinking
  and an explanation of her restrictions on <i>Lulu</i>. </p>
  <p>The dispute over the completion of <i>Lulu</i> is well known. Following
  Berg’s death there was consensus among his close colleagues that the work was
  not “incomplete” but could and should be finished. At first Helene Berg was in
  agreement, but by the early 1950s she had taken an unwavering position that the
  work should remain just as her husband had left it. Alternatives to her
  official narrative have been proposed: that she disapproved of the subject of
  <i>Lulu</i> and that she found too much of Hanna Fuchs in the opera. But the
  roots of Helene Berg’s view of <i>Lulu</i> and her sense of responsibility
  towards her husband’s work are informed by other factors that have not been
  studied, among these, the psychological effect of Helene’s familial relations
  (including her rumored paternity by Emperor Franz Joseph), her chronic health
  problems, and her affinity for spiritualism as revealed in her involvement in
  anthroposophy and its shaping influence on her concept of marriage. This paper
  will explore the constellation of factors that underlay Helene Berg’s refusal
  to see the completion of <i>Lulu</i> in her lifetime and set forth a new theory
  explaining her actions. </p>
