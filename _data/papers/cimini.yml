abstract: |
  <p>This talk is about Maryanne Amacher’s (1939–2009) sound installation
  <i>Living Sound: Patent Pending</i> (1980). This talk develops a thick account
  of Amacher’s thunderous playback and intermedial mise-en-scène to suggest a
  complex auditory rendering of the juridical protocols whereby
  laboratory-created life forms were determined to be patentable in the landmark
  case Diamond v Chakrabarty (1980) after which the installation was named.
  Using a number of audio, visual and spatial strategies, Amacher’s work
  conjures major episodes in the governance of life in the 1970s and 1980s US to
  explore how sound might be made to seem as though it were alive. <i>Living
  Sound</i> finds Amacher concerned with how this “life” might be materialized
  in the juridical, intensified in the laboratory, and supervivified on the
  market as commercial value.</p>
  <p>With this, the talk extends critical genealogies of “the body” that have
  effloresced in North American musicology with shifted attention to
  constitutive frameworks for “life” in the late-twentieth-century US Not simply
  feminized or othered by concepts of form and structure, “the body” belies a
  series of terms held in play by an array of governing structures—“life,”
  “nature,” “matter,” “carnality,” “corporeality, “viscerality”—that are
  co-extensively materialized, and implicated in different registers of
  political, social, cultural, economic and technological analysis. Amacher’s
  attention, specifically, to a concurrent feminist cultural study of
  technoscience complexly interleaved questions of music, sound and audibility
  with demands for the recognition of marginalized perspectives in the
  production of scientific knowledge, articulated in the work of Haraway,
  Hartsock, Spanier and others for whom music was far from a central concern. As
  much a locus of visceral impact as imaginative excess, “Living Sound” crafts
  from this interleave a surprising, guiding thread through a politics of life
  in which music, sound and audibility can enmesh distributions of power, agency
  and security in the late-twentieth-century US. </p>
