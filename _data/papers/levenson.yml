  <p>In 1730 the Jesuit priest Jean-Baptiste Girard was accused of the seduction
  and sexual abuse of a young woman named Marie-Catherine Cadière. Despite ample
  evidence of his guilt, Girard was ultimately acquitted. Over the following
  years, French commentators flooded the presses with pamphlets, poems, songs,
  and plays, reinterpreting the scandal as a religious parable about good and
  evil, while later Enlightenment writers drew upon the trial as grounds for
  religious skepticism. Although scholars have focused mainly on this scandal in
  its French context, it quickly spread into the international popular culture of
  its day. By examining the trial’s reception abroad, this paper reveals how the
  crime of sexual assault was reconstrued to match new political expediencies
  across national borders; Cadière’s own voice, I show, was washed out by the
  very process of dissemination and reinterpretation that had made her narrative
  famous in the first place. </p>
  <p>This paper unearths a yet-to-be studied English ballad opera from 1732 based
  on the incident, <i>The Wanton Jesuit, or Innocence Seduced</i>, and interprets
  it within the context of early-eighteenth-century British politics. For
  eighteenth-century audiences, the genre of ballad opera provided raw and honest
  commentary on the controversial issues of the day through its combination of
  popular tunes and spoken comedy; tunes signified multiple, sometimes ironic,
  meanings and communicated in a coded, aural language, helping those in the know
  to interpret subversive content. My intertextual analysis of Cadière’s sung
  ballads—recycled from pre-existing operas and songs—shows how her story became
  not only a symbol for anti-Catholic propaganda, but also a morality tale about
  how power and wealth could conceal debased deeds. Such a message, I argue,
  captured the spirit of disillusionment then felt about Britain’s
  government—spurred by the collapse of an attempted alliance with France, a
  corrupt Prime Minister, and increasing social inequality—all under the guise of
  a French headline. Yet, as the story was reworked to be about politics,
  religion, and wealth, the woman behind the scandal also faded in popular
  memory. Might Catherine Cadière join the chorus of #MeToos flooding present-day
  mass media?</p>
