abstract: |
  <p>For his Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano, op. 40, Johannes Brahms urged that
  the horn be a <i>Waldhorn</i> (natural horn), not a <i>Ventilhorn</i> (valved
  horn). Musicological commentators typically cite the recent death of Brahms’s
  mother as provoking nostalgia for the then outmoded instrument that the
  composer had known in his childhood. Furthermore, in the Romantic era the horn
  had become an “emblem of distance” (Daverio, Beller-McKenna), and,
  acousmatically separated from instrumentality, horn fifths (such as
  Beethoven’s <i>Lebewohl</i> or those found in the lauded <i>Adagio mesto</i>
  of Brahms’s Trio) were read as a musical trope of pastness and memory (Rosen,
  Berry). However, emphasis on allusion neglects that before signification,
  there is immediacy. Rather than distance or nostalgia, Brahms explicitly cited
  the pragmatism of the <i>Waldhorn</i>’s softer sound in the chamber music
  setting, and hornists have focused upon the musicality of the
  <i>Waldhorn</i>’s technique: the variable timbre produced when the player’s
  hand occludes the bell of the instrument to provide notes between the harmonic
  series.</p>
  <p>Weaving perspectives from critical organology, embodiment, and voice
  studies, I propose that attending to the <i>Waldhorn</i> in the Trio
  rearticulates timbre to melodic production and thus the material to the
  musical. The horn fifths in the <i>Adagio mesto</i> invite a reconsideration
  of the significance of the <i>Waldhorn</i>’s sound, revealing the presence of
  the hornist’s body as a cherished “grain” in the horn’s voice. This audibility
  of the body was, I argue, silenced by the valve’s mechanization and
  “digitization” (Moseley) of the horn’s design and technique, a new “romantic
  anatomy” (Davies) of the hornist that paradoxically allowed for the body’s
  erasure from melodic production. Despite resistance from Brahms and others,
  the <i>Ventilhorn</i> was the ultimate victor under orchestrational
  imperatives that demanded full control and exhaustion of instrumental
  resources (Dolan). With its consistently open and homogenized sound, I suggest
  the valved instrument itself enacted the dismemberment of timbre from “music.”
  As a response to Tresch and Dolan’s call for an “ethics of instruments,”
  remembering the hornist’s technicity reveals how its mechanization played a
  part in music’s disembodiment in the nineteenth century.</p>
