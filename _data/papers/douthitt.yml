abstract: |
    <p>Scott Walker, who died this past March, was a former teen idol who later
    adopted a strange and, some would say, disturbing avant-garde idiom. His songs
    are considered visionary by critics and peers; they are also thematically dark
    and psychologically demanding. I propose that, in his late experimental work,
    Walker composes as much with the frames of his songs as with their contents;
    that is, he treats the typical fixed givens of rock music as primary material
    for manipulation. This strategy allows Walker to reinvigorate old tropes, but
    also unsettles the listener as the terms of engagement with the music keep
    changing underfoot. The song “Phrasing” serves as a case study. Working from a
    full transcription, audio data, and an index of sounds and images found in
    Walker’s wider corpus, I analyze three overlapping areas of compositional
    manipulation in “Phrasing:” the "production space," in which dramatic
    contrasts in timbre, vocal effects, and instrumentation create a surreal
    sequence of acoustic environments; the "note space," in which octatonic
    harmonies, deconstructed backbeats, and atypical gestures simultaneously
    invoke and deny the orienting genre conventions of rock; and the
    "musico-poetic space," in which the sonic and lyrical signifiers of the song
    acquire enhanced meaning when read against Walker’s highly idiosyncratic
    personal cosmos of signs. In manipulating a listener’s multimodal experience
    of space, Walker invites interpretation using concepts borrowed from
    psychoanalytic theory. I conclude by situating Walker’s late style in the
    context of other composers who similarly intervene at the level of the
    frame.</p>
