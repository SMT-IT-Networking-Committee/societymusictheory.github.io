    <p>To generate rhythmic interest in their songs, musicians manipulate time
    feels, which affect listeners’ perception of meter by maintaining a tempo
    while making the music seem faster or slower. As de Clercq (2016) describes,
    drummers dictate time feels through the placement of the kick and especially
    snare drum. Time feels have become stylistic markers of specific genres, as
    with double-time in bebop (DeVeaux 2015, 211; Taruskin 2009, 99) and half-time
    in hardcore punk breakdowns (Easley 2011, 145). Despite their significance,
    however, scholarship on time feels remains sparse. Moreover, authors have not
    explored how instruments besides the kick and snare drums aid in creating
    feels. Although other instruments exercise more freedom within a feel compared
    to the drums, one observes recurring elements between passages of the same
    feel. Extrapolating these characteristics opens discussion regarding the
    degree to which an excerpt adheres to a feel. Characteristics associated with
    the same feel, when presented simultaneously, strengthen a feel, whereas
    conflicting characteristics weaken a feel and suggest the possibility of feels
    “in dialogue.” In this paper, I observe the musical material of instruments
    such as cymbals, electric guitar, and bass guitar in order to further
    delineate the characteristics of existing feels. I also examine how elements
    of various feels presented simultaneously strengthen or weaken the feel
    indicated by the drums. I draw examples from post-millennial rock and metal,
    in which musicians use a wide range of feels.</p>
