title: Hierarchy vs. Heterarchy in Two Compositions by Wayne Shorter
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Are there conditions for or limitations to prolongation in tonally
    ambiguous music? Are hierarchical models sufficiently robust, or are other
    analytical methods required? Such questions have intrigued music theorists
    of nineteenth-century music from Proctor to Cohn, and have animated the
    field of transformational theory. And such questions are also significant
    for jazz theorists, particularly those addressing tonally ambiguous music
    of the 1960s. In this presentation, two coauthors address such questions
    by examining two compositions by composer/saxophonist Wayne Shorter, “El
    Toro” and “Pinocchio.” Building on the theoretical work of Patricia Julien
    and Steven Strunk, we present distinctly differing points of view on the
    compositions, providing a forum to frame issues of hierarchy vs.
    heterarchy. For each piece, the first presenter argues that a hierarchical
    interpretation (implying monotonality) helps clarify the ambiguity of the
    internal progressions while the second presenter shows that heterarchical
    considerations (interactions of locally tonal events with transpositional
    cycles) overshadow considerations of monotonality.</p>

    <p>After discussing each work, the presenters conclude with thoughts on
    the evolution of jazz harmony through the 1960s. The second presenter
    offers a view of ic4 schemata, occurring first in earlier—and evidently
    monotonal—pieces, then worked into deeper levels of structure in ways that
    challenge hierarchical interpretations. Afterward, the first presenter
    provides a metric that rates various parameters of the compositions,
    providing an overall method of viewing jazz compositions on a scale of
    “clearly tonal” to “non-tonal.”</p>
