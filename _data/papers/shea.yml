    <p>Current and historical methods of metric analysis often assume that the
    first beat of a metric group is stronger than the second. This, however,
    is not the case in all repertoires. For example, a study by William
    Rothstein (2011) demonstrates that Verdi’s midcentury operas often place
    emphasis on even-numbered beats. This paper shows this metric trend to be
    even more prevalent in a corpus of 200 nineteenth-century operatic
    excerpts, (1809-1859).</p>

    <p>I present a formal model that classifies phrases according to anacrusis
    length and prosodic accent, showing where large-scale metric accents fall
    within a phrase. This model produces three metric types which align with
    Rosthstein’s (2011) previous work. Compositional and historical features
    (e.g., language, premiere date, librettist, etc.) were tracked alongside
    type in order to determine whether preferences for certain metric forms
    were more prevalent in certain contexts. This indeed was the case. For
    instance, use of even-emphasis meter increases over time, even though odd
    emphasis meter remains most common. Individual composers also show a
    significantly distinguishable preference toward each type of meter. These
    results not only confirm that the highest concentration of even-emphasis
    meter occurs in Verdi’s midcentury operas (Rothstein 2011), but that Verdi
    is the primary user of this type overall. I also demonstrate that language
    and composer nationality do not significantly affect an excerpt's metric
    type; only Verdi shows distinction in these areas. With this finding, I
    argue against using nationalist language to identify metric types and
    instead propose suggestions that better reflect an updated understanding
    of nineteenth-century metric conventions.</p>
