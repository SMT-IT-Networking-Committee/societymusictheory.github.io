  <p>After fleeing his homeland in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution (1917),
  Russian Silver Age artist and later Hollywood set designer Nikolai Remisoff
  (1887–1975) opened the Club Petroushka in midtown Manhattan. One of the
  numerous Russian-themed restaurants to emerge in New York during the
  mid-1920s, the Club Petroushka was a site in which recently arrived Russian
  émigrés could craft a particular image of Russianness to the thrill-seeking,
  prohibition-avoiding, dollar-paying public. Conceived as a “most vivid and
  multi-colored Russian tavern,” Club Petroushka conveyed a fantastic idea of
  Old Russia in everything from the gastronomic fare (“dishes entirely new to
  Gotham’s palate”) to the whimsical murals of puppets, dancing figures, and
  vibrant tavern scenes adorning the walls. Most enthralling was the “Gypsy
  camp,” a wagon-like structure situated in a corner of the room from which
  would emerge a band of “gypsies”—who, like Remisoff, were recent exiles from
  the now-communist Russia. With their “weird chants” and “passionate songs and
  dances” the Gypsy entertainers treated patrons to a multisensory encounter
  with an “indefinable spirit of Russia.”</p>
  <p>What was the “gypsy music” that helped shape the Russian experience at Club
  Petroushka? Who were its performers and composers? And in what ways did this
  music inform the cultural parameters of the post-revolutionary Russian
  diaspora (known alternatively as “Russia Abroad” and the “White Russian”
  emigration)? This paper addresses these questions, unpacking the complex
  association between “Russian” and “Gypsy” and offering a close musical and
  cultural analysis of the Russian gypsy idiom that developed in the emigration.
  Based on an examination of archival material from the Club Petroushka, memoirs
  and compositions of its musicians, extant recordings of pieces performed at
  the Club, and on its advertisements and reviews, this paper offers a
  heretofore largely overlooked realm of Russian music scholarship—the popular
  music culture of the Russian emigration—and an exploration of the ways members
  of the post-revolutionary Russian diaspora utilized Russian Gypsy music to
  display a particular iteration of “Russianness,” ultimately demonstrating the
  draw of the extra-systemic “gypsy” to the New York public and the
  auto-Orientalist strategies involved in its presentation.</p>
