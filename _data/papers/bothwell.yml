abstract: |
  <p>Despite Umm Kulthum’s prominence as the most significant performer of
  Arabic music in the twentieth century, and the excellent biographical and
  ethno-historical work on the singer (Danielson 1998 and Lohman 2010), detailed
  analysis of her musical output has been relatively limited, in English or
  Arabic. This points to a larger issue in the pedagogy of Arabic
  music-theoretical ideas to Anglophone audiences: despite the depth of the
  Arabic music theory literature, the aural/oral nature of the tradition renders
  the connection of theoretical concepts to specific recordings difficult,
  especially in the initial stages, for non-native musicians. To bridge that
  gap, this paper employs transcriptions and analytic vocabulary from a newly
  available text, my English translation of Ali Kisserwan’s <i>Meeting of the
  Great Pyramids—The Compositions of Mohammad ʿAbdel Wahab for Umm
  Kulthum</i>.</p>
  <p>With the addition of Kisserwan’s corpus of ten “long songs” (approximately
  four hundred pages or six hours of transcribed music) from the heart of the
  Golden Age tradition, together with his accompanying analyses, it becomes much
  easier to link Arabic music theoretical concepts directly to a score and sound
  examples, making them more accessible to Anglophone students.  After detailing
  the choices and compromises involved in translating Kisserwan’s book of
  analyses, I describe using these analyses in my (Western) music theory
  classroom as the basis for a unit on <i>maqām</i>, heterophonic improvisation,
  and linear analysis. Finally, I argue that familiarity with Umm Kulthum’s
  music develops facility in the analysis of linear and improvisatory elements
  of music from Western art music and popular traditions.</p>
