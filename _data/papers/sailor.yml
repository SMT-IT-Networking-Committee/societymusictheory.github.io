abstract: |
  <p>Fauré’s music exhibits frequent modulation, enharmonicism, and seventh
  chords. Yet his harmonic language was often described by his French
  contemporaries as “modal” or even “Gregorian” (e.g., Koechlin 1927). I explain
  how this curious choice of terminology derives from two aspects of the
  influence of Louis Niedermeyer’s method of plainchant harmonization in
  nineteenth-century France.</p>
  <p>The first and more widely discussed of these was Niedermeyer’s rejection of
  all raised leading tones and other alterations. The novel “cadences” that
  resulted revealed a new realm of harmonic possibilities that composers like
  Fauré quickly seized advantage of.</p>
  <p>A second aspect of Niedermeyer’s influence, arguably subtler yet more
  pervasive, was his insistence upon an antagonism between “Gregorian harmony”
  (his method of plainchant harmonization) and “modern harmony” (common-practice
  tonality). “Modality” thus demanded the active avoidance of common-practice
  progressions. Tendency tones like the leading tone were especially anathema.
  As a sort of negative image of tonality, “modality” therefore implied both the
  use of those progressions that the diatonic scale affords, yet which tonality
  disfavors or avoids, as well as the avoidance of the diatonic progressions
  that tonality favors, especially where these involve tendency tones.</p>
  <p>Using the Andantino of Fauré’s Piano Trio as a case study, I show how even
  Fauré’s major-key music is “modal” in precisely this way. The common-practice
  tendencies of scale degrees 4 and 7 are largely neutralized, and the
  paradigmatic dominant-to-tonic resolution is averted or weakened.</p>
