  <p>This paper uses Joel Mandelbaum’s <i>Four Miniatures</i> (1984) for the
  thirty-one-tone archiphone to examine the connection between physical
  performance gestures and perceived musical transformations. The topics of
  gesture and transformation have been connected since the outset of
  transformational theory; Lewin’s <i>GMIT</i> (1987) provided a basis for the
  treatment of musical intervals as “characteristic gestures” that may be
  performed or enacted. This paper considers these elements in two separate but
  isomorphic spaces, the physical space of the generalized keyboard in which
  gestures occur and a musical space (in this instance a corresponding
  <i>Tonnetz</i>) that maps pitch transformations in thirty-one-tone equal
  temperament. Focusing on the miniature titled “Triangulation,” this paper
  considers Lewin’s transformational attitude as a basis for understanding how
  the physical gestures of the performer on the archiphone keyboard invite the
  listener to actively participate in the musical transformations. Mandelbaum’s
  notes for “Triangulation” provide gestural indications that demonstrate how
  the piece should be visualized as triangular partitions of the keyboard;
  treating the piece as a series of triangular partitions that are performed in
  a particular order can assist a difficult performance on a generalized
  keyboard without the tactile information of a standard piano or organ. The
  archiphone’s generalized keyboard layout allows for unique gestural
  transformations (rotation, expansion, etc.) that generate musical content and
  structure, ultimately connecting the physical and musical spaces through the
  performer’s bodily actions. This paper demonstrates that the gestural actions
  used in the physical performance space generate a cohesive design in the
  musical space.</p>
