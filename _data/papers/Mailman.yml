abstract: | 
    <p>Besides electronic sound, another field of post-war technological innovation was the explosion of innovative music notation (graphic scores of Cage, Feldman, Oliveros, Ligeti, Busotti, and Stockhausen). Some of the same composers were forging <em>integral serialism</em> (deriving multiple features from one numeric series) and were simultaneously tantalized by the spontaneity afforded by aleatoricism (or <em>open form</em>). The aural result of integral serialism is often so kaleidoscopically fluid that it sounds derived by chance and vice versa. Boulez writes that “fluidity of form must integrate fluidity of vocabulary.” Yet beyond these two-fold connections, the multiple temporal unfoldings of Stockhausen’s <em>Refrain</em> (1959) (for piano, percussion, and celeste) uniquely synthesize all <em>three</em> of these innovational strands: notation, serialism, and aleatoricism in one entanglement. </p>
    <p><em>Refrain’s</em> striking visual presentation is known as a circularly shaped score with a rotating transparent strip of additional noteheads. Radial trajectories at varying distances from the center share features with spiral motion, which is what generates (on chromatic pitch space) the composition’s hidden all-interval 12-tone series unveiled at its centerpoint. Yet the pitch motives on the rotating strip arise from another row derived through poetic <em>sestina</em> permutation, which itself is spiral. Rotation of the strip expands or contracts the temporal distance of these motives, creating indeterminacy in the pacing of varied repetition heard in performance. In this way <em>Refrain’s</em> indeterminacy and serialism are multiply wrapped together through this concept of <em>varied-distance radial motion</em>, such that the technical operation of the score’s visual form mediates between, thereby encompassing, two opposites of Cold-war music. </p>
