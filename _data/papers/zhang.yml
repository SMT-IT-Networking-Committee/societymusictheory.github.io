    <p>Current-day discussions of expanded antecedent-consequent periods generally require some expansion to take place in the consequent; the possibility of an expanded antecedent followed by a consequent of standard length remains unaddressed. This new category subverts the period’s usual phrase-rhythmic narrative, which typically interprets the consequent as operating from norms set by the antecedent. Instead, these standard consequents adopt a more active role in “fixing” the expanded antecedent’s protracted length.</p>
    <p>This paper examines periods in which an expanded antecedent comes before a standard consequent. Drawing primarily from Dvořák, a composer whose music contains many antecedent expansions, I begin by exploring three types of phrase expansions that may arise in the antecedent: an internal phrase expansion before the antecedent’s cadence, a cadence-altering suffix, and a post-cadential extension. Following this exploration, I demonstrate the analytical possibilities of this phrase expansion using the opening movement of Dvořák’s Wind Serenade.</p>
