  <p>An imperfect authentic cadence (IAC) is usually stronger than a half
  cadence (HC) but weaker than a perfect authentic cadence (PAC). At times,
  however, its cadential strength may diverge from this traditional setup, so
  that an IAC can be as weak as a HC, or as strong as a PAC. Examining these and
  similar possibilities of the flexible IAC gives much insight into formal and
  voice-leading issues.</p>
  <p>This paper probes these unique qualities of the IAC through three of its
  non-standard but highly common guises: (1) the apparent IAC without cadential
  function, (2) the deceptive IAC, and (3) the IAC as a covered PAC. The IACâ€™s
  ability to engage with these alternative functions results in differing
  cadential strengths, giving rise to possibilities for ambiguities,
  reinterpretations, and conflicts that in turn may set the stage for
  fascinating expressive and narrative twists.</p>
