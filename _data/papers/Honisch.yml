    <p>In counterpoint to the question of whose voices are included and excluded in music academia, my paper asks a question of its own: how have changing aesthetics and shifting critical postures brought new points of emphasis to the creative practices of disabled musicians during Covid-19? Building on the premise that <em>extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures</em>, I explore the ways in which “disability music,” made and received within the curricular and pedagogical systems of “ability music” that our time of pandemic has revealed with particular clarity, throws hierarchical organizations of pitch, rhythm, phrase, melody, harmony, and ultimately, the very idea of “form” itself into crisis. My approach attends to what it means, and, crucially, what it <em>could</em> mean to be disabled at the beginning of a decade that, in Arundhati Roy’s apt words, constitutes a “portal,” inviting our presence “with little luggage, ready to imagine another world” (Roy, 2020). In so many ways, however, now more than a year after Roy’s call, the crisis continues, the portal remains untraversed, another world is left unimagined. Moving within the framework of Critical Disability Studies, and voicing the principles of Disability Justice in response to the epistemic <em>in</em>justices that reduce disability music to music’s other, can, I suggest, help us move beyond the ableist frames of a post-pandemic “return to normal,” a discourse which poses an always unanswered question: normal for whom?</p>
