    <p>Flexibility is an essential characteristic of game show music: a theme song needs to be able to accompany varying lengths of time occupied by entrances, exits, announcements, and credits, depending on the unique requirements of each episode. I argue that the game show music of Score Productions in the 1970s satisfies this need using formal ambiguity in three ways. First, the one- or multi-measure vamp can be repeated as often as necessary to fill time, as in the celebrities’ deliberations during <em>Match Game</em> or the host’s and contestants’ entrances for <em>Concentration</em>. Second, hypermetric disruption weakens listener perceptions, particularly of the four- or eight-measure group, so that these passages can be shortened or elongated. <em>Password Plus</em> employs this technique by inserting additional measures of tonic after the four-measure main theme, while <em>To Tell the Truth</em> alternates between measures of 4/4 and 3/4 in its introduction, main theme, and interludes. Finally, motivic reuse subverts length-based expectations by saturating a theme song with one single motive, or transformations thereof, as in <em>Password Plus</em>, whose four-measure main theme begins with three identical measures of a characteristic arpeggio. Used as separate entities or in combination, these elements of formal construction provide the flexibility required to accommodate the day-to-day variations in game show segment length, in addition to special situations requiring additional music.</p>
