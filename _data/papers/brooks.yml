title: "“It Is the Musician behind the Camera Who Is the Soul of the Picture”:  Music on the Sets of “Silent” Film"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>According to a 1923 account by a “film fiddler,” a motion picture’s success
  came not from the director or actor, but the musician <i>behind</i> the
  camera. The gestures, choreography, and emotional affect of films depended
  upon unseen musicians who “tickled their fiddles patiently in the studio all
  day long for a union wage and no hope of glory.” Without music on set, “tears
  would not flow so easily from the beautiful eyes of the star.”</p>
  <p>Set music was ubiquitous during the 1910s and 1920s. Far from “silent,”
  motion picture sets reverberated with ephemeral music during production. Stars
  and directors requested favorite pieces, hoping to trigger believable tears
  and laughter through personal “playlists” (although pieces such as Massenet’s
  “Élégie” were routinely used). Off-camera and unheard by eventual movie
  audiences, small house ensembles nonetheless shaped gestural vocabularies,
  coaxed credible facial expressions, and coordinated crowd and dance scenes.
  Such music was controversial; some directors and actors of the era preferred
  emotion without a musical catalyst—Lillian Gish recalled “closing her ears” to
  on-set waltzes while filming <i>La Bohème</i> (1926).</p>
  <p>While the presence of musicians on early film sets is widely known, the
  principles, functions, and economics of this vital practice have received
  almost no critical attention. Rather, most scholarship on music and early film
  has focused on post-production elements, namely the rich assortment of
  soundscapes during silent film exhibition. In this paper, I draw on periodical
  sources, memoirs, and archival documents to analyze the use and meaning of
  on-set music in the 1910s and 1920s. Incorporating recent musicological
  scholarship on gesture and emotion, I focus on music’s partnership in the
  performative act of early film production. Through case studies of directors
  such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, stars such as Blanche Sweet, and
  set musicians such as Melville Ellis, I ultimately argue that analyzing
  music’s unexplored role on silent film sets not only sheds new light on
  music’s relationship to emotion, meaning, and gesture in the early twentieth
  century, but also offers an essential new contribution to understanding the
  role of music in early film.</p>
