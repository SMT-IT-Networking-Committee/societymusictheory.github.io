abstract: |
  <p>The use of folk songs as historical evidence is highly suspect due to
  creative and satirical elaborations within the text. Yet, satire itself is
  based upon some grain of truth that has been transformed into a mockery of the
  original form. Such an example can be found within a series of quick-witted
  Horatian couplets utilized at the end of a Mexican folk song known as <i>La
  Huasanga</i>.</p>
  <p><i>La Huasanga</i> is written in the <i>Huasteca</i> song form, which is
  very distinct for its flourishingly virtuosic violin improvisations, driving
  strumming patterns within the accompaniment, and soaring vocal falsetto
  interspersed throughout each verse. The song as a whole is of little
  historical importance; however, a single interchange between two singers—as is
  customary within the genre—makes a confusing reference to Matins and Compline.
  The textual interchange reads as follows:</p>
  <p>–Rezan los padres Maitines . . . (The priests pray Matins)<br>
     –Los Maitines no son Completas . . . (Matins is not Compline)</p>
  <p>Joseph Dyer’s article, “Observations on the Divine Office in the Rule of
  the Master,” does indeed note seasonal adjustments augmenting or abbreviating
  the number of psalms sung during the night offices, yet the same practice
  indicates that Matins be recited after cockcrow. Details drawn from the third
  impression of the Puebla Cathedral’s <i>Reglas y Ordenanzas del
  Choro</i>—printed in 1731—indicate that Matins begin immediately after
  Compline. According to this timeline, Matins would still take place after
  cockcrow despite being recited much further in the day than is customary. Is
  the <i>Huasanga</i>, then, a credible source in illuminating an alteration to
  the Horarium of the Divine Office in New Spain?</p>
  <p>In comparing the text of <i>La Husanga</i> with archival information, this
  poster displays graphic organizations detailing how certain conditions would
  allow Matins to be recited as early as four o’clock in the afternoon, just
  after the conclusion of Compline at the Cathedral of Puebla in
  eighteenth-century New Spain. By presenting in this manner, I aim to provoke
  extensive discussion concerning the examination, credibility, and usage of
  folk songs as supplemental historical evidence in future investigations
  relating to New Spain.</p>
