  <p>What might music theory—a mediating and representational discipline—look
  like if it takes as its starting point the immediate, affective moment of
  musical experience? Though a perennial methodological question in the field,
  recent responses focus on establishing the untenability of question’s premise:
    that the distinctions drawn—mediated/immediate, representation/affect, or
  “gnostic”/“drastic”—are mutually imbricated. While theorists have been quick
  to illustrate this by showing how gnostic analysis affects drastic musical
  experience, they have appeared less eager to attend to the reverse: how
  experiencing music in a more thoroughly drastic manner might inform gnostic
  music-theoretical discourse. To explore this latter possibility, I engage a
  theory of music developed by music therapist Helen Bonny that guides the
  selection of music in psychedelic psychotherapy.</p>
  <p>Bonny’s theory orients to the emotional quality of music. She construes its
  general “mood” as emergent from the interaction of the emotional affordances
  of each structural musical “dimension.” The particular experience of an
  individual listener, however, depends not only on the music’s general
  affective quality, but also on the listening environment, the listener’s
  personal history, and present interpersonal dynamics. The knowledge produced
  by Bonny’s theory, that is, must always be “situated,” serving as a heuristic
  for ongoing experimentation in the hope of positive therapeutic outcomes. The
  lesson Bonny’s theoretical approach offers, I argue, is that a music theory
  oriented to the drastic would both concern itself with asking after the value
  of what it produces and hold itself accountable to the effects of its
  production. </p>
