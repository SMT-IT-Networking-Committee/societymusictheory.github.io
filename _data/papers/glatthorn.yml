abstract: |
  <p>Georg Benda’s <i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i> was an immediate success when it
  premiered in 1775. This melodrama—a genre traditionally defined as an
  alternation of histrionic declamation and pantomime with instrumental
  music—was so exotic that when it was first performed, contemporaries
  believed it might cause a revolution and dethrone opera as the reigning
  music-theatrical genre. Indeed, <i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i> ushered in a period
  during which hundreds of similar works were composed, and, by the end of the
  century, not only was Benda’s work in the repertory of nearly every German
  theater, but it was also one of the few German-language pieces translated
  for performances across Europe. Part of melodrama’s appeal was its evocation
  of the sublime. Scholars traditionally posit <i>Ariadne</i> and its
  characteristic sublime aesthetics as a “melodrama model” that was
  increasingly employed in subsequent Romantic opera. Yet such teleological
  readings of <i>Ariadne</i> fail to account for the emergence of mixed-genre
  melodramas that were situated precariously between “pure” melodrama and
  opera.</p>
  <p>This paper investigates manifestations of aesthetic hybridity between
  melodrama and opera during a period that has attracted little attention: the
  years immediately following <i>Ariadne</i>’s premiere (c.1775–80). I argue
  <i>Araidne</i>’s legacy as the paradigmatic melodrama has cast a long shadow
  over the reform movement that sought to bring melodrama closer to opera by
  including vocal music and localizing moments of the melodramatic sublime.
  Through an examination of critical responses to <i>Ariadne</i> as well as the
  melodramas they inspired, including Zimmermann’s <i>Zelmor und Ermide</i>
  (1779/1782) and Benda’s little-known <i>Philon und Theone</i> (1779), I reveal
  that works like these, rather than <i>Ariadne</i> itself, pushed the generic
  boundaries of melodrama to the verge of opera. In so doing, my investigation
  complicates both perceptions of how melodramatic moments made their way into
  opera and the very definition of melodrama. By shedding much-needed light on
  critical reactions to <i>Ariadne</i> and the works composed in response to
  them, we might understand not only early melodrama more fully, but also the
  process through which its defining aesthetics were subsumed into opera, the
  very genre some had once believed melodrama might replace.</p>
