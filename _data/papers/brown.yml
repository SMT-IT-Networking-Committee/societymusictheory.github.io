  <p>“In my school he has sung even extremely difficult things without errors,”
  boasted Bartolomeo Nucci (1695–1779) to Padre Giambattista Martini in Bologna
  in 1774, about his fourteen-year-old student Biagio, a castrato. Though not a
  professional singer himself, Nucci (a recruiter of castrati) was esteemed as a
  teacher by Giambattista Mancini, <i>maestro di canto</i> to the imperial court
  in Vienna, who in a treatise from that same year declared that the only
  remaining true singing schools were the Venetian and Neapolitan conservatories
  and Nucci’s school in Pescia. In this paper I employ Mancini’s treatise on
  singing and Nucci’s correspondence with Martini as lenses through which to
  examine the manuscripts of vocal music from Nucci’s collection now at the
  University of California, Berkeley—a unique surviving corpus of
  eighteenth-century vocal teaching materials.</p>
  <p>Though <i>solfeggi</i> are lacking in these manuscripts, many arias copied
  by Nucci’s scribes were likely for pedagogical purposes, as they omit
  ritornelli and instrumental parts, and were thus unusable for performance.
  These volumes, whose covers exhibit traces of a cataloguing scheme, contain
  compositions by Nucci, full scores by other composers (some locally copied,
  some collected from elsewhere), arrangements, and at least one operatic
  <i>parte cantante</i>. Inscriptions by and about Nucci’s students, including
  one by the aforementioned Biagio (later a pupil of Manzuoli), connect them to
  specific repertoire they studied and provide geographic touchpoints. Of
  particular interest is an “Aria da mutarsi” (substitute aria) Nucci composed
  for his protégé Vincenzo Michelotti, which can be compared to the aria it
  displaced in Jommelli’s <i>Antigono</i> (Lucca, 1746). Analysis of a dozen
  volumes of cantatas and arias at the core of the collection affords insight
  into the networks through which Nucci acquired repertoire, especially as
  individual items frequently name their cities and theaters of origin, and the
  singers who first performed them—Cuzzoni, Bordoni, Amorevoli, et al. Above
  all, these materials demonstrate that Nucci’s pupils had at their disposal
  anthologies containing some of the era’s best crafted, most demanding arias,
  through which they might learn the <i>canto di agilità</i> that Mancini
  considered reserved for only the most gifted singers.</p>
