    <p>Music-theory scholarship and pedagogy generally assume Hugo Riemann’s (1891; 1893), three functions: tonic, subdominant, and dominant. Some twenty-first-century theorists, such as Lerdahl (2001) and White and Quinn (2018), have suggested various additional functions. Already in the twentieth-century however, Prague was home to a school of Czech music theorists who developed expanded theories of harmonic function. The most famous of these theorists was Karel Janeček (1903–1974), who in his <em>Základy moderní harmonie</em> (<em>Foundations of Modern Harmony</em>, 1965) adds Lydian and Phrygian functions to Riemann’s original three.</p>
    <p>This poster presents Janeček’s theory and compares it to Riemann’s. This juxtaposition clarifies three open questions concerning Riemann’s function theory. First, is the <em>Schritt und Wechsel</em> system vital to Riemann’s approach? Second, is Riemann’s function theory so diatonic that it limits musical possibilities, as Rehding (2003) suggests, or does Riemann allow for analyzing virtually any chord into any one of the three functions, as Harrison suggests (1994)? Lastly—a concern raised by Dahlhaus (1975)—why do triads related to the tonic by fifth receive the privileged status of dominant and subdominant functions? The goal of this study is to show that examining Riemann’s reception in Prague can elucidate Riemann’s function theory, and by extension, the theories of harmonic function that scholars continue to use and develop today.</p>
