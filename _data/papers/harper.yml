  <p>Cats at keyboards. Dancing hamsters. The Numa Numa song, a flashmob of
  Beethoven 9, and videos set to “Harlem Shake” and “Black Beatles.”</p>
  <p>All of these audiovisual objects are recognizable as “viral”
  phenomena—artifacts of the early twenty-first century whose production and
  dissemination were facilitated by the internet, proliferating social media
  platforms, and ubiquitous digital devices. In this paper, I argue that
  participation in such phenomena (producing, watching, listening to,
  circulating, or “sharing” such objects) has constituted a significant site of
  twenty-first-century musical practice: viral <i>musicking</i>, to borrow and
  adapt Christopher Small’s seminal 1998 coinage. While scholarship on viral
  media has tended to center on visual parameters, rendering such phenomena
  silent, the term “viral musicking” seeks to draw media theory metaphors of
  voice and listening (Crawford 2009, 2012; Bucher 2012) into dialogue with
  musicology, precisely at the intersection of audiovisual objects which are
  played, heard, listened to.</p>
  <p>This paper analyzes several instances of viral musicking from the 2000s
  through the 2010s. It is not my aim to ontologize viral videos, or to
  enumerate characteristics of videos that “go viral.” Instead, I track viral
  circulation as heterogeneous, capacious, and contradictory—a dynamic,
  relational assemblage of both “new” and “old” media and practices. The content
  of viral material, too, spans broadly: from accidental and amateur videography
  to professionally produced behemoths like Beyoncé’s surprise 2013 album
  release.</p>
  <p>Rather, I seek to situate this variegated musicking within a tangled
  genealogy of virality. The notion of a virus as a metaphor for cultural spread
  is often credited to and traced through computer science and science fiction,
  and subsequently co-opted into marketing and media studies through
  popular-press works like Rushkoff’s 1994 <i>Media Virus!</i> However, the work
  of scholars such as Nelson (2002), Weheliye (2002), Browning (1998), and
  others offers an entwined alternate history, in which fears of cultural and
  biological “infection” concord with anxieties surrounding African diasporic
  circulation. Viral musicking activates the utopian promises of digital
  advocates, through the cooperative social operation of “sharing,” even as it
  resonates through histories and presents of racialization, miscegenation,
  appropriation, and the realities of porous, breachable borders, cultures, and
  bodies. </p>
