abstract: |
  <p>During the early American colonial period in the Philippines, zarzuelas in
  various local languages became the main form of popular entertainment. Through
  the novelty of the sung vernacular and the steady stream of Filipino
  performers and composers, the inherited Spanish genre opened up a new space
  for local productions. Early-twentieth-century zarzuelas touched on political
  and social issues as well as every day themes that resonated with a growing
  local audience. By the late nineteen-tens and early twenties, stereotypes and
  dichotomous representations of women populated the zarzuela stage. These
  portrayals range from the virtuous and idealized Filipina to the image of the
  manipulative and deviant female often depicted as products of urban
  modernization. For playwrights and librettists of the Tagalog stage, the
  zarzuelas became a vehicle to recreate the dramas of middle class domestic
  life with the goal of educating its audience and maintaining the largely
  patriarchal social order of early-twentieth-century Manila. </p>
  <p>For this paper, I address the important role of women in the production and
  performance of Tagalog zarzuelas. Focusing on the life and career of zarzuela
  artist Honorata “Atang” de la Rama (1902–91), I make more explicit the social
  and cultural capital that women wielded in the production of local theater. In
  zarzuelas such as <i>Ang Dalagang Bukid</i> (“The Country Maiden,” 1917) and
  <i>Ang Kiri</i> (“The Flirt,” 1926) De la Rama portrayed roles that
  encompassed various stereotypes of women. A closer look at De la Rama’s
  performance, however, reveals the artist’s renegotiation of gendered
  identities inscribed by male authors. By considering rare recordings of
  Atang’s popular zarzuela repertoire, I highlight the affective qualities of
  the songs she performed and the complexities of the characters she portrayed.
  Furthermore, her career not only as an actor but also as a producer of stage
  shows and as a playwright herself serve as prime example in this study’s
  attempt to recover female voices in early Philippine musical theater. </p>
