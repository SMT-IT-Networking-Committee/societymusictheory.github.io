    <p>This paper develops a model for the harmonic language of jazz pianist
    Robert Glasper. Although there is little scholarship about Glasper, he has
    been hailed as “the most prominent jazz musician of his generation”
    (Russonello 2018). Glasper’s music blends jazz with elements of R&B, gospel,
    neo-soul, and hip-hop. His chord progressions frequently feature diatonic
    tertian harmonies and clear tonal centers, but many familiar elements of
    traditional jazz harmonic syntax are often missing. I argue that, in their
    absence, recurring patterns of root and upper-voice motion within and between
    diatonic collections form a common thread that runs throughout much of
    Glasper’s music.</p>
    <p>To elucidate these patterns, I employ a music-theoretic construct with a
    rich history of modeling diatonic harmony: the ic3/4 dual interval cycle. The
    cycle efficiently models many of the diatonic chord motions and accompanying
    melodic patterns that characterize Glasper’s music. I also develop a slide
    transformation between cyclic subsets, which proves a powerful tool for
    capturing typical collection shifts in Glasper’s vamps and across his song
    forms. Ultimately, by mapping the patterns of harmonic color that characterize
    Glasper's sound, I seek to contextualize his music within the broader sweep of
    harmonic trends in post-millennial jazz.</p>
