    <p>The modern mariachi tradition is one of Mexico’s most globally recognized icons of nationalist culture and is often musically characterized as a mestizo folk form that combines indigenous rhythmic elements with Western harmonic and melodic structures. However, in Mexico, mariachi’s performative musicality is informed by discrete notions of hypermasculinity that alter how its sounds are produced and heard among native practitioners and listeners. I conceptualize this musical semiosis as <em>mariachismo</em>, a coalescence of body, instrument, timbre, and garments, which phenomenologically mirrors an ethos of Mexico’s charro figure, and which induces musical gestures of hypermasculine attitude and sound not solely understood by traditional Western music theory. This presentation decentralizes traditional Eurocentric pitch-centered systems of musical sound production by exploring the sonic dimensions of <em>mariachismo</em> as a notion of timbral listening. Mariachi sound is perceived within a timbre-centered sound system (Levine 2006) that imbues melody with a particular quality of sonic masculinity, compounded with melodic elongations of rhythmic phrasing and wide vibrato, all of which combined, complicate any theoretical analyses conducted solely through written notation. The aesthetic efficacy of hypermasculine timbre is rooted in everyday sound and listening practices in Mexico’s lifeworld, which normalize acts of excess sonic aggression that privilege a patriarchal acoustic habitus. Mariachismo’s aesthetic sounds are not reducible to Western transcriptions of precise pitch and tonal quality. Rather, they encompass a larger confluence of internal bodily knowledge, culturally learned and naturalized, representing an interface of engendered sound, listening, and embodiment.</p>
