      bio: |
        <p>Scott Schumann is currently an Assistant Professor of Music Theory at Central Michigan University, and also currently works as a content developer for Picardy, an online interactive platform for developing theory and musicianship skills. His primary research interests include music of the 20th- and 21st- centuries, and theories of expressive meaning in music, including topic theory, musical semiotics, musical gesture, and intertextuality in the music of Stravinsky. However, his poster today represents a new area of research interest, focusing on rhythm and meter in pop music, specifically the music of Tigran Hamasyan.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>Gretchen Horlacher’s work on cycles in Stravinsky’s music analyzes the rhythmic and contrapuntal interactions between ostinati, suggesting that these cycles create “a sense of progression among events,” and “produce a formal framework through the joint completion among strata of a contrapuntal pattern” (1992, 173). While there are a number of styles used in the music of pianist and composer Tigran Hamasyan (Armenian folk music, jazz, prog rock, etc.), the analyses in this poster focus on the use of asymmetrical meter, ostinati, and cycles throughout his compositional output. Three types of cycles (phrase, structural, and evolutionary) are defined and discussed using several transcribed examples of Hamasyan’s compositions.</p>
