abstract: |
    <p>Gretchen Horlacher’s work on cycles in Stravinsky’s music analyzes the rhythmic and contrapuntal interactions between ostinati, suggesting that these cycles create “a sense of progression among events,” and “produce a formal framework through the joint completion among strata of a contrapuntal pattern” (1992, 173). While there are a number of styles used in the music of pianist and composer Tigran Hamasyan (Armenian folk music, jazz, prog rock, etc.), the analyses in this poster focus on the use of asymmetrical meter, ostinati, and cycles throughout his compositional output. Three types of cycles (phrase, structural, and evolutionary) are defined and discussed using several transcribed examples of Hamasyan’s compositions.</p>
