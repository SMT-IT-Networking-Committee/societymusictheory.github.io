title: Tropological Interactions and Expressive Interpretation in Stravinsky's Neoclassical Works
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Igor Stravinsky’s neoclassical works have frequently been discussed for
    their relation to earlier musical styles, though few scholars have used
    topic theory to explore the composer’s link with music of the past. While
    topic theory is most commonly used as an analytical approach for music of
    the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scholars like Kofi Agawu (2009)
    have begun to turn their attention to topics in twentieth-century music.
    One of the more striking ways in which Stravinsky uses topics throughout
    his neoclassical works is in combination with other topics. Robert S.
    Hatten (2014) has defined this process as “troping,” which involves four
    axes or “dimensions along which an imported topic and its potential
    tropological interaction may be marked with respect to its new
    environment,” defined as degrees of <i>compatibility</i>,
    <i>dominance</i>, <i>creativity</i>, and <i>productivity</i>.”</p>

    <p>In this paper, I expand upon these four axes to examine some of the
    ways in which they interact on both local and global levels. I then build
    on these discussions through analyses and expressive interpretations of
    Stravinsky’s <i>Sérénade en la</i>, Mvt. I (1925) and <i>Apollon musagète
    </i>(1928). In both of these works, one topic is used most prominently
    throughout (hymn and French overture, respectively), while additional
    topics are troped with that characteristic figure in order to create a
    variety of expressive combinations. I will thus demonstrate how combining
    analytical insights from each axis and adapting them for a
    twentieth-century musical context can lead to more nuanced expressive
    interpretations in Stravinsky’s neoclassical works.</p>
