    <p>As harmonic practice expanded beyond the sonorities of common-practice
    tonality, the range of textures and colors available to orchestral
    composers likewise grew. The relationship between harmony and color in
    this context is a complicated one, and lines between the two are not
    always clearly defined. This paper starts from the hypothesis that timbral
    listening is an inherently embodied, ecological, and mimetic mode of
    listening, and proceeds to explore a particular orchestrational/harmonic
    technique found in 20th-century and contemporary orchestral literature:
    “mutated octaves,” a variant of traditional doublings at the octave that
    injects additional pitch classes into the octave. Mutated octaves are part
    compositional technique and part perceptual phenomenon. As perceptual
    phenomenon, mutated octaves can be classified according to the level of
    perceptual fusion they elicit. The varying levels of perceptual
    fusion—high, medium, and low—correlate with the vertical intervallic
    structures found in the sonority. In addition to offering a fresh
    perspective on the harmonic techniques at play in such passages, the
    experience of “mutated octaves” implicitly offers a critique to the
    score-as-text approach to music analysis; by grounding the analysis as an
    aural- rather than ocular-centric approach, the act of hearing mutated
    octaves in the music places the listening subject’s relationship with the
    performers on equal footing with the score per se.</p>
