abstract: | 
    <p>The music of Henry Threadgill (b. 1944), African-American composer/performer and 2016 Pulitzer Prize winner, strikes an innovative balance between composed and improvised elements. His influences include his activities with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), and the music of Varèse, and Carter. Threadgill’s music raises an interesting question about the coexistence of African-American and European traditions in 21<sup>st</sup>-century music: What methods might analysts use to describe the interaction between harmonic organization and improvisation in non-tonal settings? Building on work by Chad Taylor, Gareth Keany Hill, and Matthew Forker, I contend that attention to <em>macroharmony</em> will begin to answer this question. I use the <em>discrete Fourier transform</em> (DFT) to interpret macroharmonies and their harmonic qualities in <em>Sixfivetwo</em> (2018) for string quartet.</p>
    <p>The picture that emerges from the paper’s analytic examples is one of striking coordinations between improvisation and composed harmonic structure. Macroharmony and the DFT offer a way to probe the interaction of harmonic organization and improvisation in <em>Sixfivetwo</em>. The results may lead to a deeper understanding of the music of a composer/performer described by the Pulitzer committee as “among the most important artists in jazz.” More broadly, the results may improve our understanding of other nontonal music in which composition, improvisation, European elements, and African-American elements play equal roles, particularly that of other AACM luminaries such as Anthony Braxton and George Lewis.</p>
