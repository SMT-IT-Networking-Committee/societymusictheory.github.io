    <p>Analytical studies of rhythm and meter in extreme metal stress the inseparable relation of musical content (repeated riffs or <em>grooves</em>) with the bodily motions of performers and fans (headbanging and/or moshing). To further analyze this relationship, this paper uses live performance videos and transcriptions of songs by Meshuggah and Animals as Leaders to illustrate how and why a single extreme metal groove can encourage and accommodate multiple modes of entrainment. I argue that these riffs create “targets for bodily motion” (Zbikowski 2004, 286) through (1) the interplay of grouping and meter and (2) the realization or denial of metric projections. To accomplish this, this paper synthesizes work on extreme metal (Hannan 2018; Lucas 2018; Pieslak 2007), grooves and embodiment (Cox 2011; Kozak 2018; Pressing 2002; Zbikowski 2004), and rhythm and meter (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983; Hasty 1997). The talk will demonstrate that the ability of extreme metal grooves to promote multiple modes of entrainment is an important stylistic marker, with ramifications that speak to broader issues in the study of music and movement.</p>
