    <p>In recent years and with great enthusiasm, theorists of various analytical persuasions have aimed to understand non-normative compositional strategies within sonata-form movements. While many of these studies focus on classical music’s most renowned composers, the rise of online digital resources has provided opportunities to spotlight unusual practices in the works of lesser-known composers. Franz Clement’s Violin Concerto in D minor (c. 1810) is one such composition. Clement (1780–1842), best remembered as the commissioner, dedicatee, and first performer of Beethoven’s Violin Concerto, crafted a first-movement key scheme whose uniqueness rivals that of any sonata-form composition in the tonal literature: within the shell of a traditional Type-5 sonata in D minor, an S candidate is set in the major supertonic (E major), an EEC candidate appears in a chromatic submediant (B minor), and Clement recapitulates this music in C-sharp major. And the chromatic and tonal surprises do not end there.</p>
    <p>Our poster demonstrates that Clement’s unusual tonal plan pushes mainstream analytical approaches—namely Sonata Theory and Schenkerian analysis—to their limits. While Clement’s radical tonal maneuvers present different challenges to both systems of analysis, our two-pronged approach yields the same conclusions: (1) the first movement produces friction between its surface rhetoric, tonal rhetoric, and tonal structure; and (2) the first movement forms a compelling narrative that is represented on multiple levels of musical structure.</p>
