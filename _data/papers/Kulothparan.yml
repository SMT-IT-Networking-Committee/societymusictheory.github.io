    <p>Alter egos have played a prominent role in the history of rap like Ghostface Killah as Ironman and Tupac as Makaveli. In hip-hop’s approach to fiction, the vocal differentiation of characters is important. Nicki Minaj portrays alter egos in her music, with her most popular personas being “Roman Zolanski” and “Harajuku Barbie.” In this presentation, I explore Minaj differentiates these two personas using her vocal pitch, lyrical vocabulary, and the structure of her verses. Ultimately, these elements of her personas align beyond these qualities and relate to the stereotypical portrayals of men and women in rap music.  </p>
    <p>Kyle Adams (2009) states rappers distinguish their styles through a set of parameters. Looking at specific parameters that are manipulated within Minaj’s flow can distinguish her alter egos.  Robert Komaniecki argues that “some songs exemplify a high unity of flow, where rappers manipulate their delivery to conform to or differentiate from other artists featured in a song” (2017, 1.3). Minaj differentiates her flow to enhance the stereotypical differences of Roman and Barbie. Finally, Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) use grouping preference rules (GPRs) to define how listeners interpret groupings in a passage. I will revise GPR6 (parallelism) to three specific elements of each persona: textual parallelism, rhymed parallelism, and rhythmic parallelism. </p>
    <p>Through several elements in her flow, Nicki Minaj is able to differentiates her alter egos, which will be proven through the mentioned methodologies. My revision to L+J’s GPR6, I argue, might be useful in analyzing flow in rap music as a whole. </p>
