    <p>The abstract notion of “completion” is a central concern for many
    approaches to music analysis. We regularly speak of the completion of
    formal sections, the completion of motivic processes, the completion of
    narrative journeys, aggregate completion, and so on. Accordingly, the
    strategic use of musical incompletion, and purposeful avoidance of the
    completion of a fundamental musical idea, would be a marked musical event,
    one that could effectively portray similarly marked aspects of a given
    poetic text. In this paper I examine two songs by Clara Schumann (1819–96)
    that explore the notion of strategic incompletion of the fundamental
    structure in two interesting ways: (1) delaying the first appearance of
    the tonic harmony until nearly the end of the song through an expanded
    auxiliary cadence, and (2) establishing the tonic harmony early on as
    expected but concluding the song on the structural dominant, resulting in
    a “permanent interruption” (see Latham 2008).</p>
    <p>By purposefully suppressing aspects of the fundamental structure
    through the devices mentioned here, music can become charged with dramatic
    tension and rich with expressive potential. These two techniques represent
    opposite ends of a spectrum, one concerned with incompletion directed at
    the beginning of the fundamental structure, the other with incompletion
    directed at its conclusion. More generally, composers may draw upon the
    abstract notion of strategic incompletion to depict any number of
    musico-poetic sentiments in a song.</p>
