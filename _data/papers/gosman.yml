abstract: |
  <p>Rondo forms are particularly vulnerable to having a theme excessively
  repeated. The more parts that a rondo has, the more susceptible it is to being
  dragged down by a refrain’s repetition. While current theories of Classical
  form recognize that composers often embellish, shorten, or even eliminate
  successive refrains, this paper will consider that in doing so, composers have
  the opportunity to energize their rondos with new methods of organization, and
  may even break out of a movement’s rondo underpinnings. To demonstrate this, I
  will consider several movements in which later refrains are shortened or
  absent.</p>
  <p>For example, the third movement of Beethoven’s Violin Sonata no. 3 in E
  flat major is in sonata-rondo form. Its Refrain 1 is in rounded binary form
  and presents the opening theme three times. Beethoven avoids excessive
  repetitions of the theme by taking advantage of the first refrain’s rounded
  binary design, which is punctuated by three home-key PACs. Beethoven uses all
  three of these cadences as refrain stopping points, successively halving the
  length of each refrain and eliminating one PAC.</p>
  <p>The early drafts of the second movement of Beethoven’s “Eroica” Symphony
  indicate that Beethoven conceived of this movement as a five-part rondo. The
  form transforms during the compositional process, as a result of Beethoven
  shortening Refrain 2 with each consecutive draft. I will also consider the
  fourth movement of Haydn’s Symphony no. 101 and Beethoven’s “O namenlose
  Freude” as cases in which the complete omission of a refrain both destabilizes
  and energizes sonata-rondo form.</p>
