abstract: | 
    <p>Scholarly praise for Arthur Sullivan’s operetta music often singles out his varied rhythmic treatment of Gilbert’s highly regular verse. Prior studies tend to examine Sullivan’s text-setting in a vacuum, without a framework for comparing his approach to that of 19<sup>th</sup>-century composers more generally. Such a framework has emerged in recent scholarship on German art song by Harald Krebs, Yonatan Malin, Stephen Rodgers, Robert Snarrenberg, and others. This paper thus has two goals: (1) to use current theory to pinpoint the distinctive aspects of Sullivan’s approach; (2) to use Sullivan’s music to expand our conception of the possible relationships between poetic and musical meters.</p>
    <p>I take Malin’s theory of “declamatory schemas” as my main jumping-off point. Composers create variety within a song by changing from one schema to another. Rather than describing these moments as successions (in which one schema follows another), I instead treat them as transformations (in which one schema is converted into another). I focus on four of Sullivan’s techniques of schema transformation: stress deletion, stress addition, grouping dissonance, and selective compression/expansion. I show how Sullivan’s deployment of these transformations is motivated by characterization and the inflection of particular words.</p>
    <p>I conclude by affirming: (1) the value of applying declamatory schema theory to music that is neither German nor “serious”; (2) the necessity of performing style analysis within a framework that discloses an individual composer’s dialogue with common musical practices, shedding light on composer and practice alike.</p>
