    <p>Tonal relationships, as well as musical style, reflect the characters’ sexual relationships and transformations in the British camp musical <em>The Rocky Horror Show</em> (Richard O’Brien, 1973). The show is set in a dilapidated cinema and parodies science-fiction and horror movies: a bisexual, cross-dressing, alien, mad scientist—one of a trio of aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy Transylvania—sexually preys on Earthlings and creates an idealized male lover for himself, evoking both <em>Pygmalion </em>and <em>Frankenstein</em>. The show’s first six songs establish a clear tonal contrast between the innocent, conventional humans, who are introduced in flat keys and are the only ones to sing in minor keys, and the sexually aggressive, queer aliens, who are introduced in sharp keys. Changes in tonal areas also reflect the characters’ transformations. The most dramatic of these is Janet’s sexual awakening, depicted in “Touch-a, Touch Me” by a shift from the weakly defined A minor of the verse to A major in the chorus, a key associated with the Transylvanians and, by extension, with sexual agency. The pump-up modulation to Bę major at the end of the song reflects her increasing excitement and also restores her opening key, suggesting that she has internalized this new sexual agency.</p>
