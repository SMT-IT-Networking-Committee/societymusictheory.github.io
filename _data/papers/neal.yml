    <p>In 1972, country singer Barbara Mandrell covered soul star Joe Tex’s “Show Me,” remaking the song into a southern stew of soul, fiddle hoedowns, and a final gospel shout chorus combined with a fiddle break. The recording serves as a metaphoric biography of its producer Billy Sherrill, with his complicated career spanning Muscle Shoals to Nashville’s country boom period. The recording also offers an opportunity to probe one of the underlying tensions in country music: its indebtedness to a rich blend of cross-racial Southern common-stock elements, yet frequent predictions from cultural gatekeepers such as eminent country music historian Bill C. Malone of the genre’s ever-impending demise from the continuation of such blending.</p>
    <p>Within that framing tension, this paper examines country covers of soul hits, including “Show Me” and Shirley Brown’s “Woman to Woman,” to illustrate the impact of soul on country music’s vocal styles, specific songwriting practices, and fan reception in the late 1960s and 1970s. The contemporary academic discourse of Diane Pecknold, Charles Hughes, and others lays out the historiography of music industry personnel moving fluidly across country/soul scenes. These analyses enrich that history by cataloging and interpreting the musical artifacts that resulted from those cross-genre moves. Ultimately, these cover songs ended up exposing the dual nature of genre reception: they offered shared musical ingredients but reinscribed genre difference through the deployment of distinctive musical tokens, amplified by the marked racial identities of the performers.</p>
