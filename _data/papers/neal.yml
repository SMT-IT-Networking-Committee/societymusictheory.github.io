  <p>Where have all the V chords gone?  On November 4, 2015, country singer
  Chris Stapleton stepped on stage at the Country Music Association awards show
  and knocked out a stunning performance of “Tennessee Whiskey,” a classic
  country song recorded by both David Allan Coe and George Jones more than three
  decades earlier. The moment was heralded by critics and fans alike as a
  celebration of roots-oriented, traditional, hard country music, a welcome
  antidote to widespread pop-crossover trends. But Stapleton’s cover version—and
  his choice to perform with pop/soul singer Justin Timberlake—thwarted one of
  the fundamental musical traits of country music: an adherence to conventional
  principles of tonal harmony. Stapleton threw out all of the song’s V chords.

  <p>This paper explores the politics of harmonic language in the context of
  country music’s roots-revival. Specifically, many of the musical performances
  that are heralded as revivals of country draw heavily on a harmonic language
  that signifies R&B and soul music, a situation that invites nuanced
  considerations of race. Drawing on case studies of Chris Stapleton, Sturgill
  Simpson, and historical comparisons with Ray Charles’s recordings, this
  analysis concludes that the harmonic language of this roots revival within
  country music represents a duality of meanings in the current scene: it
  simultaneously invokes roots and tradition within a genre where the past is
  revered, and complicates the genre’s oversimplified history by reconfiguring
  its musical identity.</p>
