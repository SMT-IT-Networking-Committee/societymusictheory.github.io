abstract: |
    <p>The embodied rhetorics accompanying transformational theory have often served to vindicate its mathematical apparatus (Lewin 1987; Attas 2009; Straus 2011a), yet rarely has attention been devoted to the question whether that fundamentally discrete apparatus is at all suited to capture the continuous motion implied in wording such as “gesture” and “dance.”</p>
    <p>As an instance of this larger problem, I focus on the concept of inversional symmetry and its analytical application. In an examination of Straus’s (2011b) reading of inversional symmetry in Schoenberg and Webern in terms of “balance lost and regained,” I show that his twelve-tone-derived analytical toolbox itself presupposes a discrete and static opposition between balance and imbalance rather than a continuous and dynamic process of balanc<em>ing.</em> Consequently, such an analysis does not allow for a gradual going-in-and-out<em>-</em>of-balance, or for any finer-grained distinction between different asymmetric states.</p>
    <p>To address these shortcomings, I introduce a computer-assisted procedure that interprets inversional axes as a special instance of a general feature of pitch distributions, which I call their <em>melodic center of mass</em> (MCM), in analogy to physical centers of mass. The MCM of melodies can be tracked through time by means of a moving-average algorithm.</p>
    <p>Beyond its engagement with embodiment and temporality, this approach permits interpretations in terms of disability, musical forces, and concepts in technical timbre analysis. Most importantly, the critique of the discrete apparatus of post-tonal theory takes seriously the concern with music as “characteristic gesture,” “idealized dance,” or more broadly, as something meant to happen <em>in time.</em></p>
