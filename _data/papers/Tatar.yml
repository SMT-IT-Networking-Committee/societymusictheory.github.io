    <p>Screw Music, also known as “Chopped and Screwed,” is a sub-genre of hip-hop that developed in the 1990s in Houston, Texas. Created primarily by slowing and pitching down existing recordings, Screw Music is often described as sounding sluggish, woozy, and disorienting. </p>
    <p>My presentation explores the unique affective qualities of Screw Music, using two concepts drawn from recent research into timbre as my foundation: the notion of an emergent timbre and the motor mimetic hypothesis. An emergent timbre typically arises from the seamless blending of several sounds, one which exhibits qualities not readily present in any element alone. To describe the characteristic timbral features that result from the paired lowering of pitch and tempo in Screw Music, I adapt this concept to encompass an emergent timbral <em>transformation</em>. Next, I suggest that this effect is overwhelmingly perceived by listeners somatically. The motor mimetic hypothesis argues that our comprehension of music at least partially results from our imagining of making those sounds ourselves—this appears to be especially true with Screw Music. Finally, I mobilise these observations into a brief analysis of a scene from the Barry Jenkins film <em>Moonlight</em> (2016), whose emotional climax is diegetically scored by a Screw Music song.</p>
    <p>Accounts of timbre in hip-hop have typically focused on either its role in distinguishing a song’s textural layers or its indexical potential for nostalgia. My study foregrounds the relationship between this music’s sound and the listening body, and in so doing hopes to expand our understanding of timbre’s social dimensions. </p>
