abstract: |
    <p>The central role of transcription in the music of Michael Finnissy has
    been well documented. According to the composer, “Because I don’t have a
    particular fetish any more for generating original material, I often, even
    in pieces I don’t acknowledge as transcriptions, take the material from
    somewhere else.” To date, commentators have focused on the literary and
    political resonances of Finnissy’s borrowing without dissecting his modes
    of transformation, specifically his alteration of tonal function.</p>
    <p>This study draws on both the handwritten sketches and the autograph
    manuscript of Finnissy’s 5½-hour solo piano work, <i>The History of
    Photography in Sound</i> (1995–2001). Two separate Beethoven borrowings
    illuminate Finnissy’s transcriptive compositional process. Both excerpts
    appear in the section of the History entitled <i>Kapitalistisch
    Realisme</i> (<i>met Sizilianische Männerakte en Bachsche
    Nachdichtungen</i>) [Capitalist Realism (with Sicilian male nudes and
    Bachian paraphrases)].</p>
    <p>Finnissy’s transformative borrowing technique is analogous to the
    photographic process of “overexposure,” whereby an excess of light creates
    a washed-out, undetailed image. Two examples of Beethoven borrowings from
    <i>Kapitalistisch Realisme</i> chart the process from source to sketch to
    autograph: one highlights Finnissy’s favoring of inner voices over iconic
    melodies; another demonstrates his habit of “untying” the functional
    tonality of his sources, a method akin to the recently-documented borrowing
    techniques of Messiaen. Combining handwritten sketches and autograph
    manuscripts, this study details the precise mechanisms at work as Finnissy
    confronts, subsumes, and “overexposes” Beethoven’s music.</p>
