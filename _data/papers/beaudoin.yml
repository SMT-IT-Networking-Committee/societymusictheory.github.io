title: "Solti Recording Time in Mahler: Microtiming and Phrase Rhythm Annotations in Two Conducting Scores of the Fourth Symphony"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Solti’s two extant, heavily marked Doblinger conducting scores of Mahler’s
  Fourth Symphony—housed in the Sir Georg Solti Archive at Harvard’s Edna Kuhn
  Loeb Music Library—are full of handwritten Arabic numerals, ostensibly to
  denote phrase groupings. Using these respective scores, Solti made two
  commercial recordings of the work: in February 1961 with the Amsterdam
  Concertgebouw and in March 1983 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
  Contributing to the emerging field of conductor-centric recording studies,
  this paper combines analyses of Solti’s score annotations with microtiming
  measurements of their related recordings to chart evolutions in his Mahler
  interpretation between 1961 and 1983. </p>
  <p>After taking a bird’s-eye view of Solti’s numbering system, special
  attention is paid to moments of contradiction between the older and younger
  conductor. While such contradictions are rare, they illuminate significant
  changes-of-mind. Anacruses become downbeats, emphases shift, and the music is
  reimagined: a first movement development passage marked 3+3 in 1961 becomes
  4+4 in 1983; a pair of third movement phrases marked 7+5 with the
  Concertgebouw becomes a symmetrical 6+6 with Chicago. </p>
  <p>Solti’s two commercial recordings of the symphony document the effects of
  these annotations. Micro-temporal comparisons of specific phrases—made with
  the Lucerne Audio Recording Analyser [LARA]—illustrate the performative and
  expressive consequences of the conductor’s changes in metric emphasis.
  Understanding the act of music-making as taking place across varied media,
  developments in Solti’s Mahler interpretation are measured by connecting
  handwritten score annotations, vinyl records, and spectrographic
  microtiming.</p>
