    <p>Is the sound of breathing inappropriate? The recording industry seems to think so. Sound engineers often classify audible breathes as “extraneous noises;” apologetic record producers deem them “insignificant;” and a leading audio editing company markets a “breath control” plug-in that removes all traces of inhaling and exhaling via their proprietary “intelligent suppression” software. The same philosophy of negation applies to sounds of effort (grunts, moans) as well as those created by recording media (wax cylinder clicks, vinyl hissing).</p>
    <p>All sounds deserve recognition. This paper asserts that non-notated sounds in recordings of notated music are neither extraneous nor insignificant; rather, they are integral to a recording’s expressive content and analogous both to facial micro-expressions and the Barthian photographic punctum. Non-notated sounds are here divided into three categories: (1) sounds of breath, (2) sounds of exertion, and (3) sounds created by the recording apparatus itself. Each category is illustrated by a recording of early 20<sup>th</sup> century music: Claire Chase recording Varèse, Evgeny Kissin recording Prokofiev, and Maggie Teyte recording Debussy. Fusing spectrographic microtiming measurements</strong> <strong>with score-based rhythmic analyses, I probe the question: how does the rhythm of sounds created by the bodies and equipment of performers relate to, interact with, and expand upon the rhythm of the work being performed? In conducting a census of the sounds captured by the microphone, this research opens a space to analyze—and to celebrate—the expressive content of sounding bodies, instruments, and recording machines.</p>
