title: "Sketching and Imitating: Cage's <i>Cheap Imitation</i> and the <i>Song Books</i>"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>John Cage the borrower presents a paradox: both reverential and
    seemingly arbitrary, his appropriation of the words and music of others
    (e.g. Satie, Thoreau, Joyce, Mozart, Schubert, Duchamp, McLuhan) seems a
    baffling mix of defacement and whimsy. We must examine his working methods
    to learn how—and why—he borrowed.</p>
    <p>In <i>Cheap Imitation </i>(1969), Cage retains the rhythmic structure of
    Satie’s <i>Socrate</i> (1918) but uses the <i>I Ching</i> to substitute new
    pitches for Satie’s. This paper examines those among the 90 <i>Solos for
    Voice</i> in the <i>Song Books</i> (1970—“We connect Satie with Thoreau”)
    that Cage composed using the “cheap imitation” process. Sketches of these
    “cheap imitation” <i>Solos</i> reveal that an interplay of subjectivity and
    rigor went into the composition of these works. Cage does not use his
    source materials as mere grist for his <i>I Ching</i> mill; for example,
    Thoreau’s words and his reception of them are part of the <i>Song
    Books</i>. Far from rejecting all forms of subjectivity, Cage’s
    compositional method incorporates his own response to his chosen
    “collaborators.”</p>
    <p>Scrutiny of his sketches shows how the <i>Song Books</i> instantiates
    this dialectic between chance and his love of those who influenced him.
    They illustrate tensions between chance and choice that hold significance
    for the way we talk about indeterminacy, for our reception of Cage’s music,
    and for our investigations into the nature of musical borrowing and
    homage in general.</p>
