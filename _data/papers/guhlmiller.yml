    <p>One of the first questions a student of Ars Antiqua polyphony asks upon
    attempting to decipher the notation of a piece of music is “What mode is
    this in?” It is a tricky question with layers of assumptions behind it.
    Yet as anyone who transcribes this material, particularly that written
    down before about 1280, can attest, there are frequently multiple modes
    that a given piece can be “in” as well as multiple rhythmic
    interpretations of ligatures within a given single mode. Rather than
    assuming that when there are multiple possibilities it is because of a
    weakness in the notation, this study assumes that the notation offers
    these possibilities because it is not meant to present a single
    interpretation, but several possible interpretations, one of which may be
    selected at a given moment by the mutual will of the performers.  Drawing
    on theoretical traditions from Boethius to Anonymous of St. Emmeram, this
    paper will argue that the theorists expected the musicians to use their
    instincts when applying meter to song; making choices together as a group
    through the act of performance rather than relying solely on their reason
    and the notation. The study will conclude with a proposal for a new
    electronic edition of Ars Antiqua polyphony which would include numerous
    measured interpretations of a given work and give performers the chance to
    choose the one(s) they preferred to perform, along with a practical
    demonstration of what this would entail through a live performance of
    multiple interpretations of a motet.</p>
