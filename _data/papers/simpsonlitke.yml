    <p>In their 2007 study, Phillips-Silver/Trainor demonstrated how physical
    movement has the power to shape aural perception of meter, showing that it
    was not enough to observe physical movement; in order for participants to
    hear an aural stimulus in the meter of a given movement pattern, they had
    to embody it themselves. Following other recent attempts to broaden how
    music theorists approach analysis, this paper investigates ways in which a
    dancer’s unique listening perspective provides insights into the musical
    structure of salsa songs—insights that would not be made without such an
    embodied experience. To illustrate this approach, I will examine the song
    “Yaye Boy” in some detail. The initial lack of percussion in Cuban group
    Orquesta Aragón’s arrangement highlights the metric ambiguity of the
    opening melodic line, making the interpretive job of the dancer
    particularly difficult as none of the musical accents align with the entry
    points of the possible basic footwork patterns. While NY/Senegalese group
    Africando’s arrangement clarifies the location of the downbeat, supporting
    the ambiguous melodic line with the interlocking percussion patterns
    typical of salsa, this arrangement soon highlights a larger-scale
    hypermetric irregularity in the song’s phrase lengths. Because the
    footwork pattern is a hypermetric cycle spanning two measures of music,
    dancers are acutely aware of and affected by disruptions in phrase
    structure. Through their physical interactions with such frequently
    occurring moments of disorientation in salsa, dancers may either increase
    the tension of or help to reconcile metric conflicts, adding exciting
    interpretive layers to the art form.</p>
