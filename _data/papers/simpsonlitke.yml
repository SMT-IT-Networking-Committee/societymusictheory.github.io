  <p>While salsa takes many forms within individual dancing communities, two
  fundamental styles have developed in the US and spread worldwide—“On-1/LA” and
  “On-2/NY”—so-named after the metric location of changes in direction in the
  basic dance step. Dancers/musicians note the differing movement qualities of
  each style and debate their artistic legitimacy; however, the question of
  <i>why</i> these variations produce such contrasting effects has not been
  sufficiently addressed in the literature. </p>
  <p>McMains 2015 provides an interesting point of departure for this
  investigation by connecting footwork timings to the improvisatory practices of
  the dance: “[The difference between basics] may seem like a trivial
  distinction, but it actually changes the entire sensation of the dance because
  the beat on which no change of weight is taken falls in a different place in
  each pattern. Because this suspended step is the moment in which both dancers
  have the most freedom to improvise, its placement just before or just after a
  turn . . . significantly alters the dance” (149).</p>
  <p>I begin by examining how the physical accents of On-1 and On-2 footwork
  align with those of the music. I then explore how the mechanics of standard
  dance moves change with the basic step, noting how On-1 dancers have more time
  to prepare/resolve the move, while On-2 dancers receive more time for the move
  itself. These differences in timing are subtle but significant because they
  open up small spaces (in different metric locations) for improvisation—places
  wherein dancers express individuality, articulate style, and interact with a
  song’s unique musical features. </p>
