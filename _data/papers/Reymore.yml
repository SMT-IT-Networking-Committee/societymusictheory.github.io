    <p>Jaqueline Leclair’s 2020 album, <em>Music for English Horn Alone</em>, represents a landmark for the versatile—but often underestimated—English horn. The album includes the premiere of Karola Obermüller’s <em>different forms of phosphorus</em>. I offer a timbral-motivic analysis of this piece, arguing that formal understanding is best achieved by considering timbre as a primary parameter. </p>
    <p>Obermüller’s genius in <em>different forms of phosphorus</em> comes in part from her elegant mastery of motivic narrative. Although the motives include melodic and rhythmic content, their distinct perceptual characters emerge from timbral properties, sometimes evinced by variation of other properties. Four principal motives are woven together to create a musical narrative of coalescence, each dominating one large-scale formal section. The <em>pedal</em> motive is a harmonically rich, sustained tone which explores timbral variation through manipulation of vibrato and microtonality, while the <em>multiphonic</em> motive contributes texture. The <em>singing</em> motive manifests in two versions, <em>keening</em> and <em>plangent</em>, primarily differentiated by registral effects on timbre. The <em>drip-drop</em> motive, characterized by crisp articulation and short durations, interacts with the “extreme reverb” to produce rich, densely layered overtones. These motives begin as apparently separate entities but struggle for integration throughout, culminating in a climactic, energetic stream spiraling out into the ether, leaving the impression that these motivic processes, and their momentum, endure beyond our listening. </p>
    <p>Finally, I address how this timbral-motivic approach can be applied to other works, including multi-instrumental music, and I reflect on the piece/analysis in a wider context as they confront three types of underrepresentation within music theory.</p>
