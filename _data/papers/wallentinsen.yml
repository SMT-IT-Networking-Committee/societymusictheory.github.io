title: "\"Repeat and Repeat Again\": A Reexamination of Fuzzy Contour in Steve Reich's <i>The Desert Music</i>"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Steve Reich’s <i>The Desert Music</i> employs a key aspect of Reich’s
    compositional philosophy: melodic phasing. The phasing process places the
    theme against itself at various levels of metric displacement (Cohn 1992;
    Roeder 2003), creating regions of multilinear melodies that challenge
    listeners to understand melody in different ways. Contour plays a
    significant role in the perception of these melodic processes. Ian Quinn’s
    (1997) analysis of fuzzy contour relations in <i>The Desert Music</i>
    provides quantitative evidence regarding the contour similarity of Reich’s
    melodies, but does not address the complexity with which this melodic
    similarity is experienced in the context of Reich’s phased musical
    fabric.</p>
    <p>This paper expands upon Quinn’s analysis, using a new model of fuzzy
    familial contour membership to analyze complex multilinear melodies that
    result from Reich’s phasing technique. I model the emergent melodic
    possibilities within the multilinear pattern by mapping the contour
    motions (ascent, descent, or plateau) of each melody in each passage onto
    a Contour Adjacency Grid that is framed on the total number of attack
    points in the passage. The resulting composite representation captures the
    probability of divergent contours as they occur throughout the passage,
    allowing for exploration of experiential possibilities afforded by the
    musical fabric.</p>
    <p>These affordances suggest further connections with phenomenological and
    cognitive theories of multistability (Idhe 2012; Karpinski 2012). By
    examining relationships between melodies in terms of these multistable
    possibilities, I offer a more sensitive account of the contour relations
    listeners may perceive within the music, providing a better understanding
    of Reich’s minimalist process.</p>
