    <p>Amplifying recent scholarship, our paper dismantles Stravinsky’s iconoclastic self-image as a radical modernist via an examination of his neoclassical style through a tonal lens. Stravinsky frequently adapts clear tonal models to create music that not only “gestures” towards common-practice tonality, but inhabits it (Concerto for Piano and Winds, Largo; Violin Concerto, Aria II).</p>
    <p>Both Lynne Rogers’s “dissociation” and Donald Traut’s expanded notion of “displacement” have informed analyses of Stravinsky’s counterpoint. However, we argue that (1) “dissociated” passages often preserve underlying tonal schemas; (2) Traut’s pervasive normalization of perceived displacements is too reductive. </p>
    <p>In our expanded analytical purview, we identify seven contrapuntal techniques Stravinsky employed (including displacement): (1) Harmonic ambiguity, where two possible harmonic interpretations coexist. (2) Displacement of upper-voice notes in relation to the bass; conversely, added bass notes can intrude into the timespan of a well-paced upper voice. (3) Dissonances above a pedal can repeat persistently, regardless of chord changes, and are not obligated to resolve. (4) Common Dissonance types (e.g., suspensions) may be “incorrect” in their melodic or metrical treatment.</p>
    <p>Three further techniques are more particular to Stravinsky: (1) The Elision of the end of a harmonic progression into the beginning of another, causing two different harmonic functions to overlap. (2) Heterophony, where two different elaborations of the same schema sound simultaneously—giving rise to forbidden dissonances. (3) Finally, in the case of a Persistent bass, the bass note holds on to the previous harmony for too long. Thus, the upper voices should be taken as structural.</p>
