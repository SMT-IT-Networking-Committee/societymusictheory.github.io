    <p>Amplifying recent scholarship, our paper dismantles Stravinsky’s iconoclastic self-image as a radical modernist via an examination of his neoclassical style through a tonal lens. Stravinsky frequently adapts clear tonal models to create music that not only “gestures” towards common-practice tonality, but inhabits it (Concerto for Piano and Winds, Largo; Violin Concerto, Aria II; Symphony in C, Larghetto).</p>
    <p>Both Lynne Rogers’s “dissociation” and Donald Traut’s expanded notion of “displacement” have informed analyses of Stravinsky’s counterpoint. However, we argue that (1) “dissociated” passages often preserve underlying tonal schemas; (2) Traut’s pervasive normalization of perceived displacements is too reductive. </p>
    <p>In our expanded analytical purview, we identify seven contrapuntal techniques Stravinsky employed (including displacement): (1) <u>Harmonic ambiguity</u>, where two possible harmonic interpretations coexist. (2) <u>Displacement</u> of upper-voice notes in relation to the bass; conversely, added bass notes can intrude into the timespan of a well-paced upper voice. (3) <u>Dissonances above a pedal</u> can repeat persistently, regardless of chord changes, and are not obligated to resolve. (4) Common <u>Dissonance types</u> (e.g., suspensions) may be “incorrect” in their melodic or metrical treatment.</p>
    <p>Three further techniques are more particular to Stravinsky: (1) The <u>Elision</u> of the end of a harmonic progression into the beginning of another, causing two different harmonic functions to overlap. (2) <u>Heterophony</u>, where two different elaborations of the same schema sound simultaneously—giving rise to forbidden dissonances. (3) Finally, at the phrase level, the notated <u>Bass line</u> may supplant the conventional bass implied by a theme type, contradicting intrathematic units’ “natural” formal functions.</p>
