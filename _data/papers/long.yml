        <p>Megan Kaes Long is Associate Professor of Music Theory at the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music and a 2020–21 ACLS Fellow. She holds a B.A. in music from Pomona College and a Ph.D. in music theory from Yale University. Her work focuses on the intersections of tonal and modal traditions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Her monograph, <em>Hearing Homophony: Tonal Expectation at the Turn of the Seventeenth Century</em>, explores the role of text setting, rhythm, meter, and phrase in articulating tonal trajectories in homophonic vernacular partsong of the late Renaissance; it was published in May 2020 by Oxford University Press. Her articles appear in <em>Music Theory Spectrum</em> and the <em>Journal of Music Theory</em>, and her newest article, “What do Signatures Signify? The Curious Case of Seventeenth-Century English Key” will appear in JMT this fall. In non-COVID times, Megan is also a mezzo-soprano who specializes in early music; she performs with choral ensembles in the Cleveland area.</p>

    <p>This project develops a historically grounded model of pitch structure in the music of William Byrd, drawing on sixteenth-century music theory, recent research on sixteenth-century pitch frameworks, and analysis of computational data. The poster presents a subset of this data to argue for a model of tonal structure in Byrd’s music rooted not in modality, but rather in solmization. I extracted key profiles from a digital corpus of Byrd’s vocal and keyboard music, then performed cluster analyses to identify pieces with similar pitch content.</p>
    <p>Many compositions cluster into mode-like groups. Byrd writes in two forms of minor resembling the Dorian and Aeolian collections. Pieces with a flat signature and D keynote appear in both groups, suggesting that signature and keynote are not consistently reliable indicators of pitch content. Instead, these paradigms differ because of flexibility built into English solmization. A scale ascending from D (D-E-F-G-A, or <em>la</em>-<em>mi</em>-<em>fa</em>-<em>sol</em>-<em>la</em>) may continue to either B&#9837; (<em>fa</em>) or B&#9838; (<em>mi</em>). Apparently modal clusters do not necessarily imply pre-compositional modal planning; we might instead understand modality as an emergent property of other characteristics of sixteenth-century pitch structure.</p>
    <p>Cluster analysis also highlights outlying works. Compositions with A keynotes and no signature divide into two groups with sharper and flatter orientations. Some multi-part compositions straddle these two groups. Typically, Byrd creates tonal contrast in multi-part works by changing the keynote. However, these findings reveal that Byrd also shifts orientation flatward or sharpward to create similar contrast. Again, these distinct paradigms reflect solmization’s flexible treatment of B&#9837;.</strong></p>
