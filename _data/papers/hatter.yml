  <p>A plethora of mid-fifteenth-century northern European paintings and musical
  compositions exhibit self-referential features, elements that allude to the
  artists or the act of creation. Comparing these works reveals that
  professional identity was a growing concern for visual artists and musicians.
  Art historians have long recognized that large altar paintings featuring St.
  Luke, the patron saint of painters, in the act of painting or drawing a
  portrait of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child were created to memorialize the
  professional and spiritual concerns of local guilds of visual artists. Through
  self-referential features, including self-portraits of the artists as St.
  Luke, these works acknowledge the shared practices that bound these
  professionals into a distinct community, from youthful apprentices to
  consummate masters. Ecclesiastical musicians in the mid-fifteenth century
  similarly relied on a shared set of “tools of the trade,” which were imparted
  through a system of apprenticeship, essential to preserving and augmenting the
  professional musical community. Understanding the self-referential features
  embedded in compositions as the counterparts of the paints and brushes
  included in guild paintings of St. Luke allows us to understand the ways
  musicians celebrated and expressed their professional status as a group.</p>
  <p>Guillaume Du Fay composed two self-referential compositions during his
  employment as a musician and administrator at Cambrai Cathedral. <i>Fulgens
  iubar</i>, an isorhythmic motet for the Purification of Mary, has long
  garnered scholarly interest because of its pithy imperative acrostic—“Petrus
  de Castello, canta!” or “Sing [this line] Pierre!”—but it also displays
  previously unrecognized solmization puns. These features in the top two lines
  draw attention to the very people who would have sung them and who were
  engaged in solmization as an aspect of their pedagogical practice—the master
  and choirboys. Du Fay likewise included solmization puns in his personalized
  setting of the <i>Ave regina celorum</i> antiphon and into the physical
  memorial plaque that he designed to hang in the cathedral after his death.
  Like guild paintings of St. Luke, these prayerful acts of musical
  memorialization affirmed, through self-reference and the display of musical
  “tools of the trade,” the identity and interests of an enduring community of
  professional musicians.</p>
