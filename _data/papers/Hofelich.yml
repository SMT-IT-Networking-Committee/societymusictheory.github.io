abstract: | 
    <p>The majority of Shostakovich studies has privileged analytical investigations of his symphonies and chamber works, but not works for solo piano. The Op. 87 preludes exhibit structural and harmonic tendencies similar to his larger works while demonstrating meta-compositional musing on Baroque preludes. This reflection often takes place through a triadic post-tonal lens that distorts structural direction in favor of expansion. I situate Preludes 4, 13, and 22 in linear frameworks and engage with motivic threads between them.</p>
    <p>In Preludes 4 and 13, I illustrate how linear descents occur in multiple dimensions. Octave descents in each cycle of Prelude 4 resemble those in preludes from Bach’s <em>WTC</em>, Book I, reflecting pathways based on the rule of the octave. The composing-out of a descending fourth in triadic post-tonal contexts with the coupling of ^3 throughout, however, produces a static <em>Urlinie</em>. A melodic descending fourth generates harmonic content in Prelude 13. While parsimonious voice leading might be explored in mm. 44–47 of the coda, this passage is better considered the result of motivic nesting, where a diatonic tetrachord is chromatically embellished in an inner voice. </p>
    <p>Like Prelude 4, the structural immobilization of Prelude 22 results from large-scale melodic inactivity. An inert ^3 is prolonged throughout, overriding the direction generated by chromatic meandering in the foreground. Recurring neighboring motions and their chromatic intensifications, combined with the static middleground, contribute to a petrified musical exterior.</p>
    <p>This paper explores how Shostakovich’s synthesis of orthodox compositional practice and triadic post-tonality engages with structural hearing. </p>
