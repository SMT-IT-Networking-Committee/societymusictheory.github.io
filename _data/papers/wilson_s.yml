  <p>Disconcerting blasts of feedback, harsh distortion, malfunctioning
  equipment, and what Pauline Oliveros has called “negative operant phenomena”
  (1983): these are the sonic materials of so-called “noise music.” With roots
  in post-1945 avant-garde electronic music, industrial music, and a punk DIY
  attitude, noise music has emerged as a thriving musical practice. It also
  poses a special hermeneutic challenge because of its thoroughgoing
  unconventionality and lack of notation, which has led to scholarship that
  focuses mostly on context. We lack thorough discussion of what can be learned
  about this music through alternative forms of sonic analysis that account for
  its aural actuality.</p>
  <p>Building on work by Ricoeur (1976), Attali (1985), Lochhead (2006), Demers
  (2010), and others, I propose a multifaceted approach to find meaning within
  extreme forms of sonic expression that exist primarily as sound recordings.
  Taking into consideration six dimensions of noise—acoustic, communicative,
  symbolic, subjective, transcendent, and phenomenological—my theory of noise
  addresses not only the context of the expressive language, but also the aural
  actuality and experience of the music. This, in conjunction with spectral and
  waveform analysis of a sound recording, contributes to an interpretation that
  combines the analysis of acoustical information with a philosophical reading
  of the use of noise in music. </p>
  <p>Using the work of internationally renowned noise composer Merzbow (a.k.a.
  Masami Akita) as a test case, this paper will examine his landmark recording,
  <i>Pulse Demon</i> (1996). A multifaceted hermeneutic examination reveals this
  ostensibly impenetrable onslaught of formless sound to be a symbol of the
  Schwittersian destruction of art, an acoustical assemblage of unwanted sounds,
  and a traumatic physical experience akin to what Voegelin calls a
  “transgression of bodily integrity” (2010). Ultimately, the goal of this
  project is to provide a way for future scholars of extreme musical practices
  to interpret radical works in a way that accounts for their sociocultural
  context, symbolism, experience, and aural actuality.</p>
