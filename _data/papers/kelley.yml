title: A Corpus-Based Model of Voice Leading in Tonal Music
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>This study proposes an empirically derived model of tonal voice leading
    that can be used to teach part writing in undergraduate harmony courses.
    Machine-learning algorithms divided scale degrees into classes based on
    their voice-leading tendencies in the corpus.  The resulting theory
    therefore extends Harrison’s (1994) harmonic-function-based voice-leading
    models, Quinn’s (2005) “Harmonic Function without Primary Triads,” and
    Shaffer’s (2014) scale-degree categories in <i>Open Music Theory</i>, and
    provides corpus-derived evidence for the use of scale-degree functions.
    The dataset used in this study was generated from MIDI files of 1582
    four-voice homorhythmic chorale-style hymns selected from <i>The Cyber
    Hymnal</i>.  An algorithm for determining harmonic function was applied to
    create a list of each voice’s scale-degree numbers and their harmonic
    functional context.  Using this data, the machine learning produced a
    hidden Markov model with six states that can be interpreted as
    scale-degree functions.  Dividing the model into 21 scale-degree classes
    clarifies how each of the original six classes behaves in every harmonic
    context.  This computer-generated statistical voice-leading model was then
    consolidated into a simple set of voice-leading procedures applicable to
    all tonal contexts that undergraduate music majors can easily learn in
    order to master the technique of tonal part writing and analysis.</p>
