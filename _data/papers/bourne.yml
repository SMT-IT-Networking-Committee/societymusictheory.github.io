  <p>How does music convince us characters are geniuses or not? The 2016 film
  <i>Hidden Figures</i> tells the long-ignored history of three African American
  women scientists and their essential work at NASA during the early 1960s
  American space race. From the beginning, the screenplay represents these
  women, especially math prodigy Katherine Goble Johnson (as played by Taraji P.
  Henson), as innate, natural geniuses, and their intellectual prowess helps
  them overcome obstacles they face because of their race and gender in 1960s
  Virginia. But, using an analysis of musical topics (Monelle 2006) and thematic
  development (Bribitzer-Stull 2015), I demonstrate that the musical score
  (Zimmer and Williams) reinforces a negative stereotype that women lack innate
  genius. To analyze how the score reinforces this stereotype, I use
  psychological research (Leslie 2015), intersectionality (Crenshaw 1989), and
  analysis of musical topics and thematic development in relation to events in
  the narrative. In addition, I compare patterns of genius topic appearances and
  thematic development in <i>Hidden Figures</i> to patterns in films about the
  archetypal white male genius (e.g., <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>). Musical themes
  and features of topics represent these characters and their identities:
  pastoral topic for female identity (Kassabian 2001), jazz topic for African
  American identity (Maxile 2008), and mathematical/genius topic (relying on
  minimalist features) for genius identity (Eaton 2008). When these topics are
  troped, or merged together (Hatten 2004, 2–3), they create an emergent
  meaning that represents intersections of these characters’ identities. While
  characters in <i>Hidden Figures</i> overcome struggles, musical analysis of
  the score reveals their genius identity is not assumed innate. </p>
