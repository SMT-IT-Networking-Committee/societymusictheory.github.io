title: "From Decoration to Reinterpretation: Improvisation, Composition, and the Perception of Similarity in Variation Sets"

abstract: |
  <p>Swinkin (2012) argues that 18th-century composers “decorate” the theme in
  theme and variations (T&V) while 19th-century composers “reinterpret” it. I
  theorize the boundary between variation and improvisation by arguing that
  18th-century composers conceptualized theme and variations form as more
  improvisational, especially since many variations began as improvisations.
  However, 19th-century composers considered T&Vs more compositional, reserving
  improvisation more for other forms. While the improvisation/composition
  continuum seems limiting, it may illuminate the stylistic shift in T&V
  composition between the 18th and 19th centuries—from “decoration” to
  “reinterpretation.” Scholars define a melody as relations between notes, and
  listeners use analogy to perceive relations. Therefore, cognitively, people
  use analogy to hear variations as similar to one another. I create a framework
  based on psychologist Genter’s (1983) model of analogy to analyze how
  composers kept or altered relations when varying themes. I use this method in
  conjunction with Schema Theory (Gjerdingen 2007) and Topic Theory (Mirka 2014)
  to analyze the presence or absence of improvisational features in T&Vs, since
  schemata were often figures for improvisation and topics communicate
  improvisational features (e.g. runs, figuration). I analyze “decorated” T&Vs
  (Mozart’s K. 377/ii, K. 265; Daube’s variations) and “reinterpreted” T&Vs
  (Beethoven’s op. 35, op. 109/III, <i>Diabelli</i> Variations; Brahms’s op. 9),
  measuring which relations composers kept the same and analyzing features of
  musical improvisation. I discuss how relational features change over time, and
  demonstrate how style change interacts with cognitive capabilities and
  conceptualizations of the improvisation/composition continuum—how composers’
  conceptualization of theme and variations altered the product of
  variations.</p>
