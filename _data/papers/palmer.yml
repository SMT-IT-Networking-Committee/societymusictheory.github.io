title: "Who's Feeling Crooked Now? “Progressive Bluegrass” in the Metric Disruptions of Punch Brothers"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Punch Brothers, led by mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile, is a “progressive
    bluegrass” supergroup. Their standard bluegrass instrumentation—mandolin,
    fiddle, banjo, guitar, and bass—is at times their most bluegrass element.
    While early albums established their artistic prowess, their 2012 album,
    “Who’s Feeling Young Now?” “shifted the emphasis…to playful storytelling”
    (Chinen 2012). The most conspicuous element of play found throughout this
    album is its “crooked” meter. I demonstrate how one can perceive Punch
    Brothers’ metric indebtedness to bluegrass, while also discerning the
    distance of the Brooklyn-based group from the original “Crooked Road” (the
    Virginia Heritage Music Trail) in their progressive art rock approach to
    other musical aspects.</p>

    <p>The song “New York City” is emblematic of Punch Brothers’
    bluegrass-rooted “crookedness,” containing straightforward metric elisions
    or deletions, typical of bluegrass. “Soon Or Never” raises the stakes with
    two metric disruptions that engage a common bluegrass time quirk known as
    a “backstep.” Punch Brothers takes this typical bluegrass manoeuvre and
    builds a two-fold disruption that begets further metric quirks later in
    the song. “Don’t Get Married Without Me” creates the perceptions of metric
    deletion and addition through a progressively lengthening anacrusis. My
    transcriptions suggest different metric interpretations of the song’s
    disruptions of different pulse levels. These metric quirks become
    increasingly disruptive throughout the song as Punch Brothers saturates
    the metric structure with numerous conflicting impulses.</p>

    <p>I conclude with a discussion of Punch Brothers’ carefully crafted text
    to “Don’t Get Married Without Me” as it engages with multiple metric
    disruptions.</p>
