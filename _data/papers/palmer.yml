abstract: |
  <p>A salient feature of bluegrass music is metrical play. Much of this
  metrical play can be explained by crookedness, bluegrass backsteps, or more
  broadly by metric deletions. But many twenty-first-century bluegrass songs
  feature conspicuous and sustained metrical play that pushes beyond the genre’s
  traditional confines, often deploying extended anacruses, and requiring a
  shift in analytical focus.</p>
  <p>I highlight recent bluegrass artists who engage in metrical play by
  employing metrically unstable anacruses. The anacrustic groups in the passages
  I discuss are rendered metrically unstable through syncopation, changes in
  sub-tactus grouping, harmonic delays, and/or melodic misdirection. As such,
  they are marked loci for metrical play, calling previously established
  periodicities or grooves into question, necessitating flexible metric
  interpretations, and causing listeners to construct new expectations for
  future arrivals. I demonstrate how rhythmic regularity and scalar patterns can
  forge protracted anacrustic groups that “nudge” arrival points and complicate
  phrase groupings.</p>
  <p>Specific passages from Punch Brothers’ “Don’t Get Married Without Me”
  (2013), Béla Fleck and Abigail Washburn’s “Don’t Let It Bring You Down”
  (2017), and Punch Brothers and Sarah Jarosz’s “Locked In” (2017) reward close
  readings, as they engage multiple modes of listening and different potential
  metric interpretations. I deploy a combination of Gretchen Horlacher’s and
  Christopher Hasty’s annotation systems, which allows for easy viewing of
  relatively local metric disruptions, alongside the metric function of a
  particular note or figure.</p>
  <p>I conclude with a brief discussion of the agential role of the voice and
  text-meter relationships.</p>
