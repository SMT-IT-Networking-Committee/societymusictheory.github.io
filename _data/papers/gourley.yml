    <p>Upon returning from a tour of the USSR with Benny Goodman, American vibraphonist Victor Feldman released a best-selling record titled “The World's First Album of Soviet Jazz Themes” in 1963. Despite the sensationalist title, his album of Soviet-inspired jazz was certainly not the first in the world, nor even the first in the United States. By that time, the Russian diaspora in America had already been dancing to Soviet swing for more than a decade, though few outside the community had taken notice. Scholarship on Soviet popular music has largely concentrated on its social and ideological status within the confines of the country. I shift perspectives to consider the circulation of Soviet jazz outside the country’s borders, examining the role of record labels managed by Russian-American expatriates. My paper addresses the role of diaspora in the (re)mediating processes of circulation, reformatting, and politicization of Soviet jazz in America. Drawing on archival research at the Museum of Russian Culture in San Francisco, I analyze how diasporic record labels imparted their political views by curating and creatively reissuing recordings. Different generations of immigrants presented conflicting views of Soviet cultural life and held contrasting conceptions of the jazz genre itself. Given that Soviet-produced vinyl was difficult to come by in the United States, I highlight how a handful of record labels acted as intermediary points which affected the American reception of Soviet records. Ultimately, I argue that the expansive circulation of Soviet jazz recordings complicates the paradigmatic framing of the genre as a one-way cultural flow from the United States to the Soviet Union. An expanded notion of circulation yields new insights into the ways in which recordings are (re)mediated and politically inflected as they travel from place to place.</p>
