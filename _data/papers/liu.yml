    <p>In the history of Brahms reception, developing variation—both as technical procedure and as an aesthetic value—has shaped analytical discourse immensely. Except for Schoenberg’s celebrated analysis of op. 51/2, slow movement, scholarship has focused on sonata-allegro movements, where motivic economy and apotheoses that “logically” flow from seemingly inexorable development are routinely praised. But outside the spotlight of first movements, one finds developing variation used for a different end: especially in slow movements, despite pervasive thematic unity and the presence of fully realized rotations, the sort of linear causality and logical entailment associated with typical sonata forms is bypassed in favor of a stream-of-consciousness rhetoric that surprises listeners at every turn. </p>
    <p>Since this facet of developing variation has received less attention, I analyze the Adagio of the Second Symphony. Given its seamless, ever-evolving surface, how can we nevertheless account for the impression that initial ideas do not motivate/determine future events, that important formal/tonal arrivals and climaxes arise fortuitously? I focus on three passages: the opening 32 bars (P-TR), the lengthy retransition, and the much condensed recapitulation. Caplin and Schmalfeldt’s formal-functional recontextualization is my primary tool for explaining how later rotations’ partial, pared-down recalls of earlier material twist a cantabile—if troubled—opening into a tragic yet irresolute ending, at the same time showcasing Brahms’s idiosyncratic handling of the rotational principle. In sum, I demonstrate how even within an environment of developing variation Brahms can consistently problematize continuation and thereby challenge reception history’s simple unity/disunity binary. ---</p>
