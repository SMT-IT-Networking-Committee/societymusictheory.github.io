abstract: |
  <p>In the history of Brahms reception, “developing variation” emerged as a
  central concept. Another suggestive term, “musical prose,” often accompanies
  discussions of developing variation. It originates from “Brahms the
  Progressive,” which defines musical prose as “the direct and straightforward
  presentation of ideas, without any patchwork, without mere padding and empty
  repetitions.” Thus far in the scholarly literature, developing variation (a
  loose collection of compositional procedures and techniques) is said to
  generate musical prose. </p>
  <p>My paper seeks to restructure the relationship between developing variation
  and musical prose because a small number of “prose”-like pieces by Brahms
  exhibit almost no developing variation, especially some inner movements of the
  four symphonies. To accommodate these, I reconceive “musical prose” as
  encompassing two distinct categories. One is the well-known developing
  variation, which sees non-exact repetitions operating under a semblance of
  logic (at any given moment, something of what has come before is preserved
  while simultaneously something new is introduced). The other is what I call
  <i>modular discourse</i>, which does not rely on traditional motivic/thematic
  working-out to generate new content. What modular discourse and developing
  variation have in common is that both avoid literal repetition (i.e., “empty”
  repetitions). But whereas developing variation keeps to one train of thought,
  modular discourse presents incises or “modules” that are not related by a
  common denominator, and a great number of them in quick succession. To
  demonstrate modular procedures at local and higher formal levels, I analyze
  passages from the slow movements of the First and Second Symphonies. </p>
