abstract: |
  <p>While academic attention to early recordings has proliferated over past
  decades, the pursuit of expressive meaning associated with their idiosyncratic
  performance techniques is relatively nascent. Scholars who delve into meaning
  often draw upon contemporaneous written texts linking performance techniques
  to affects in order to complement close listening. Nonetheless, a sense of
  foreignness still accompanies these recordings: the recovery of the
  connections between technique and affect does not necessarily provide comfort
  for today’s performers and listeners. </p>
  <p>Two recent trends point towards more accessible approaches to meaning:
    emulation by historically informed performers (imitation of early
  recordings), and critically subjective analysis by performer-scholars. In this
  paper, I propose a bodily based, collaborative phenomenological approach to
  analyzing recordings, using as a case study Adelina Patti’s 1905 rendition of
  Cherubino’s arietta “Voi che sapete” from Mozart’s <i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i>.
  Combining performance and analytical insights, the methodology features four
  components: emulation of recording, articulation of embodiment, association of
  embodiment with lived experience, and integrated interpretation. </p>
  <p>The emulating performer’s embodiment of Patti’s performance during two
  climactic moments can be read as Cherubino progressing within the arietta from
  an unfocused searching to sexual awareness. The lingering execution of the
  climax, which differs from surging climaxes heard in many historical
  recordings, points to a non-normative experience of sexual pleasure, adding
  dimension to Cherubino’s much-debated queerness. The proposed approach adds
  interpretative specificity while engendering a sense of familiarity. The
  performer’s emulative act could be seen as radical corporeal empathy in the
  context of a feminist musicology that strives for ethical musicological
  approaches.</p>
