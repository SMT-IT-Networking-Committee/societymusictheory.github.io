  <p>Though the heroic memory of the armies of the French Revolution and the
  Empire was greatly celebrated in French culture throughout the nineteenth
  century—leading to numerous performances, literary evocations, and to wide
  iconographic dissemination—the real condition of musicians in the wars led by
  France has been little explored. This is all the more surprising given that
  the French opera of this period reveals the crucial importance of martial
  music in the collective imagination, and that a large number of musicians were
  implicated, with their experience bearing witness to the trace of collective
  traumas (Forrest 2002, Petiteau 2011, Fureix & Jarrige 2015).</p>
  <p>Rather than focusing on music in the context of war (Goodman 2010), this
  paper interrogates the trajectories of musicians enlisted in armies, and the
  way in which the technologies of discipline, incorporated and imposed by
  musicians, impacted how music was taught, before spreading across the social
  and political world (Gumplowicz, 1988, Pasler 2015). I will bring together a
  wide range of testimonies—including soldiers’ memoirs, works on military
  technologies, medical publications, contemporaries’ accounts, the archives of
  aid associations, and the press—and will compare documents from disciplines
  such as music, theater, medicine, education, media and international law, in
  order to elucidate military musicians’ real conditions of existence, both
  during their service, and before and after their military careers. For among
  those musicians who later re-integrated the civilian world, some became
  pedagogues, while others found work in orchestras or theaters, in what were
  often subordinate roles. I will then focus on the case of the musician
  François Sudre, whose youth was marked by the Napoleonic wars and by the
  problematics of military music. Sudre was the inventor of the
  <i>telephonie</i>, which provoked rich discussions on musical organology,
  military encryption, universal languages, and social utopias. From the
  Napoleonic wars, which spectacularized and instrumentalized music, to the
  struggle for a unified and harmonious world, I argue that the aesthetic,
  moral, and political questions raised by the lives of these forgotten
  musicians, reveal contradictions of modernity concerning the role of vision
  and sound in the city.</p>
