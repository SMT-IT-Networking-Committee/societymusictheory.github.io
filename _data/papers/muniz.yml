title: "‘The ear alone must judge’: Harmonic Meta-Theory in Weber’s <i>Versuch</i>"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Gottfried Weber makes ambiguous and apparently contradictory claims about
  the nature of chords and keys in his <i>Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der
  Tonsetzkunst</i> (1817–21). This paper asks whether any consistent
  meta-theoretical framework underlies his statements. Specifically, what
  criteria determine the identity of a chord (e.g., as tonic), or the key of a
  given composition? Without the answers, we cannot know what “chord” and “key”
  really meant to Weber—a serious hindrance to understanding his theory.</p>
  <p>I attempt to remedy this situation through a close reading of ambiguous
  passages. Weber might hold either of two general views of harmonic structure,
  described in DeBellis 1995. According to <i>dispositionalism</i>, a chord is a
  tonic because it creates tonic-ish sensations. In contrast, <i>causalism</i>
  entails that chord identity is independent of perception. There is evidence
  for versions of each view within Weber’s text. Ultimately, I argue that
  Weber’s argumentative strategies, word choices, and analytical narratives
  favor a version of causalism, though not decisively so. Although its
  conclusions are tentative, my discussion suggests new foci for future debate
  on Weber’s meta-theoretical views, as well as points of contact with the
  conceptual foundations of current music theory.</p>
