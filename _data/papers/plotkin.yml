He has taught many advanced seminars on mathematical music theory and analysis, as well as advanced seminars on the analysis of song. He has given multiple SMT annual conference presentations, as well as presentations at other venues including American Mathematical Society conferences and the Clough Conference. His research appears in <em>Music Theory Online, </em>the <em>Journal of Mathematics and Music</em>, World Scientific's recently-published book <em>Mathematical Music Theory</em>, and other publications. He has previously served on the SMT Networking Committee and as Chair of the SMT Mathematics of Music Analysis Interest Group.</p>
        <p>Richard sings all the time (especially nowadays) with his wife and two wonderful daughters, and is looking forward to our very socially distanced conference.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>Capturing specificity of character in song is crucially important when writing for musical theatre, and Sondheim’s work, which is consistently specific, lends itself to careful study. Ballads of love, torch songs, and almost-love-songs take on unique qualities when affected by aspects of a character’s gender and age. Sondheim’s deliberate coordination of harmony, form, rhythm and rhyme combine to express in-the-moment revelations about his characters’ moods and desires. There are two particularly illuminating examples of women struggling with their futures: “Losing My Mind” (<em>Follies</em>), sung by Sally for a love that has not materialized, and “On the Steps of the Palace” (<em>Into the Woods</em>), sung by Cinderella as she determines to change her awkward relationship with the prince. In the first example, we will examine how rhyme and harmony are manipulated to offer or deny closure. In the latter example, we will look more at the manipulation of form to express Cinderella’s confused stream of ideas.</p>
