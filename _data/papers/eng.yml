    <p>I have successfully used for some years now children’s music to teach chromatic harmony, in a course that is part of the undergraduate theory sequence required of all classical and commercial majors. My rationale for using this repertoire was threefold: to create learning activities that can connect with students who are unfamiliar with classical music, to show that chromatic harmonies can also be relevant to diatonic melodies, and to incorporate my identity as a parent of young children into my pedagogy. This lightning talk describes my journey in designing learning activities and the culminating composition project for this course, beginning with varying levels of engagement with nursery songs, before diversifying to include activities based on film and show tunes premiered by children. Examples that I will share include harmonizations by me or my students of tunes like “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,” “Five Little Monkeys,” “Over the Rainbow,” and “My Funny Valentine.” I shall also share excerpts from past student performances of culminating compositions, not only those that engage with children’s music, but also exemplary compositions in other genres and styles to demonstrate that teaching chromatic harmony using children’s music need not limit students’ creativity in composition projects. </p>
