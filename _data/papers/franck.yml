    <p>Recent research concerning embodied cognition and agency showcases how a performative perspective impacts music analysis: De Souza 2018 treats musical instruments as spaces through which performers may navigate and Klorman 2016 treats instruments within chamber works as characters between whom may engage in conversation. Both approaches make correspondences between actions of real performers or idealized instruments and abstract models, such as networks of fretboard shapes or formal functions. These correspondences demonstrate that a performative perspective involves an interface between physical actions and theoretical frameworks. Viewed this way, a performative perspective is neither entirely physically grounded nor abstractly oriented, but rather situated on a continuum between these poles. Such a context enables analysts to confer agency upon performers by making them obvious representatives of physicality. But the continuum along which the performative perspective resides enables any phenomenon—physical or abstract—to play such roles. Indeed, Schenker often imparts agency to abstract constructs. For instance, he writes, “The fundamental structure is always creating, always present and active” (Schenker 1979, 18). A performative perspective, thus, permits analysts to grant agency to any phenomenon they see fit, be it a performer, instrument, or linear progression, to name just a few. With this broad interpretation in mind, the paper explores how a performative perspective can enhance analysis by endowing voice-leading strands with agency. The paper first presents models adapted from cognitive linguistics for explaining meanings of concepts related to causation and then applies them to analyses of select works.</p>
