abstract: |
  <p>Although French composer Cécile Chaminade (1857–1944) was widely celebrated
  in Europe, nowhere was she more admired than in the United States. American
  enthusiasts wrote fan letters and founded over two hundred Chaminade clubs.
  Contrary to gender norms that discouraged female musicians from appearing in
  public—especially for money—Chaminade performed for more than forty-two
  thousand people during her three-month 1908 American tour. According to
  Christopher Reynolds’s Women Song Composers Database, Chaminade was the most
  published non-English speaking female composer in the United States from 1890
  to 1920. Yet, historians have generally dismissed Chaminade as a traditional
  Victorian woman, concerned only with traditionally “feminine” music, following
  Nicholas Slonimsky’s famous characterization of her in 1944 as a “French
  composeress of ingratiatingly harmonious piano pieces adorned with endearingly
  sentimental titles, possessing a perennial appeal to frustrated spinsters and
  emotional piano teachers.” Musicologists have typically disregarded
  Chaminade’s fame because of her female devotees and have thus ignored what her
  music meant to her audience during the height of her career. </p>
  <p>In contrast, Chaminade’s public image at the turn of the twentieth century
  consistently projected traits of both the conventional “True Woman” and the
  emerging “New Woman.” This helped make her life story and her music resonate
  with women across the United States. The large body of music Chaminade
  composed was evidence of her professionalism, a trait of the “New Woman.”
  However, most of her music was in genres considered appropriate for female
  listeners and performers, thus contributing to the composer’s image of not
  having transgressed too far into the public sphere. In addition, newspapers
  and magazines emphasized Chaminade’s youthfulness, familial dedication, and
  domesticity, alongside proclamations of her popularity and vast output. Novels
  that mentioned Chaminade’s music placed it in traditional domestic settings,
  but also used it to depict educated women determined to control their own
  destinies. Chaminade was a talented female musician who drew strategically on
  contradictory images of womanhood to maximize her appeal to a wide audience
  and gained the freedom to compose and perform at a time when women were still
  discouraged from doing either.</p>
