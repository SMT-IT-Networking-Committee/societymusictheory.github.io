    <p>The discourse on aesthetic autonomy poses an originary question for music theory in that it attempts to define the relation between an artwork and the society in which its meanings can be said to cohere. The classic conception of aesthetic autonomy posits a categorical separability between the work of art and society, creating an airtight hermeneutic bubble in which an artwork’s beauty can be contemplated apart from the exterior social world. In the late twentieth century, scholars associated with the New Musicological turn struggled to burst this bubble, introducing frameworks for music meaning that insisted on the constitutive role of contextual social differentials like gender and race. In recent years, however, scholars have used Marxist and post-Marxist analysis to rebuke New Musicology’s contextualism and reconsider formalism and autonomy as a strategic framework for sharpening musicology’s critical potential. </p>
    <p>In this talk, I argue that this discourse has hardened into an antinomy that misrecognizes racial difference as merely epiphenomenal to, rather than constitutive of, forms of social domination specific to capitalist society. By introducing the rich theoretical tradition on “racial capitalism” into the aesthetic debates that alternate between “race” or “capitalism” as a prioritized framework for cultural analysis, I offer a way for music theorists and musicologists to rematerialize their analyses. Rather than a zero-sum choice between race as social difference and capitalism as totalizing system, a critical vantage rooted in racial capitalism will lead to a more salient conception of relationship between music and the world.</p>
