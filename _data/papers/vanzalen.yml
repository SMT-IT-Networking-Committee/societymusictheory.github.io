  <p>In sharp contrast with the cultural and political interpretations now
  common in musicological studies of other French baroque repertoire, scholars
  such as Douglass (1969, rev. 1995), Higginbottom (1999), and Shannon (2012)
  have consistently explained the stylistic characteristics and
  registration-based genres of French baroque organ music as consequences the
  timbral and technical capabilities of the organs for which the repertoire was
  written. Yet, little consideration—beyond Higginbottom’s preliminary work
  (1979)—has been given as to why French baroque organists so highly valued
  timbral specificity.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I place mid-seventeenth-century French baroque organ music,
  specifically that of Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, within the context of
  post-Tridentine French Catholic liturgical reform. Nivers is best known today
  for initiating a more precise approach to registration in French organ
  compositions and publications, but he also dedicated much of his career to
  reforming Gregorian chant. As Brulin (1999) argues, seventeenth-century French
  theologians valued rhetorical declamation for its ability to help spoken and
  chanted prayers move the hearts of listeners to greater devotion. Thus, as
  Davy-Rigaux (2004) and Karp (2005) have demonstrated, Nivers reformed and
  rewrote chant in accordance with declamatory principles. </p>
  <p>I argue that Nivers’s organ compositions exhibit a similar rhetorical
  approach, and that in them timbre serves several rhetorical purposes. French
  rhetoricians like Bernard Lamy believed that orators could move listeners’
  passions by incorporating vivid imagery into their speeches. Similarly,
  Nivers’s use of timbre helps to depict the affective nuances of the liturgical
  texts that the versets of his organ mass replaced. Lamy also prioritized the
  effective delivery of orations and emphasized using a variety of tropes and
  figures to capture and maintain an audience’s attention. Likewise, Nivers
  provided detailed instructions on how to register, ornament, and deliver his
  compositions. Within and between the versets of his organ suites he
  incorporated a wide variety of motives, ornaments, rhythms, textures, and
  timbres. Thus contemporary French approaches to rhetoric, as valued by those
  involved in Catholic liturgical reform, offer a new explanation for the
  importance of registration and timbral specificity in the French baroque organ
  repertoire that Nivers helped to develop.</p>
