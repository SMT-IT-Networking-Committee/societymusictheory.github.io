abstract: |
  <p>Based on drafts and sketches from the newly acquired and still uncatalogued
  Kaija Saariaho Collection at the Sacher Stiftung, this paper argues that the
  role of Clémence as we know it in the opera <i>L’amour de loin</i> (2000) is
  significantly revised from the composer’s original conception of that part.
  Saariaho wrote the role for Dawn Upshaw and had written for her before
  (<i>Lonh</i> for soprano and electronics, 1996; <i>Château du l’âme</i> for
  soloist and orchestra, 1996), but those are relatively brief pieces; a major
  role in a full-length opera makes altogether different demands in terms of
  stamina and tessitura. Saariaho sketched the vocal lines by hand, and it is
  clear from these documents that the role of Clémence as originally composed is
  actually for a coloratura; Upshaw’s Fach is lyric soprano. Saariaho revised
  the part for her, and the published score (2003) is the Upshaw version. In
  2005 Chester Music produced a “high tessitura” version because Kent Nagano
  wanted to record the opera with the role of Clémence as originally conceived
  and did so with coloratura Ekaterina Lekhina (Harmonia Mundi), but that score
  is not commercially available. This paper uses archival materials as well as
  interviews with Saariaho and Upshaw to recreate the revision process, and then
  analyzes the two versions of the role. I will argue that they envoice
  different characters, and consider how those characterizations might affect an
  audience’s experience of Clémence.</p>
