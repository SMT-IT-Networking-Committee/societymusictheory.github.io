    <p>Innovations in audio recording and playback technology continue to raise our expectations of sound reproduction quality. At the same time, the advancements of technology have allowed musicians the ability to subvert that expectation for artistic expression. One approach involves sonic emulation of older playback devices (e.g., an AM radio receiver, a gramophone) or even devices not designed for music at all (e.g., a telephone). Expanding on the work of Dibben (2012), Moore (2017), Moylan (2012), and Zagorski-Thomas (2018), I suggest the effect of such cases goes beyond playful gimmick or nostalgia—it produces an additional mediative layer to the listening experience, thereby impacting how listeners interpret their relationship to musical sound and, consequently, its perceived expression and meaning. Billie Eilish’s “Party Favor” (2017) begins by creating the impression that Eilish is leaving a voicemail message to sever ties with her significant other, but this perspective is transformed gradually until a sound quality typical of a modern pop record is reached in the first chorus. While Eilish’s <em>narrative</em> voice remains unchanged throughout this process, the <em>sound</em> of her voice and other instrumental components creates an emergent shift of listening perspective (from the significant other to Eilish). The manipulation of spatial impressions through production techniques creates a dynamic listening experience that invites us to inhabit <em>both</em> perspectives as listeners. I argue such listening experiences demonstrate that spatial impressions do not represent an isolated aspect of musical encounters, but rather function as an integral element that can influence all facets of song production.</p>
