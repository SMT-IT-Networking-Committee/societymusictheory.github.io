    <p>This paper analyzes improvisational interactions between musicians and
    dancers in three performance scenarios: a Cuban <i>rumba guaguancó</i>
    performance, a Brazilian <i>candomblé</i> ritual, and a drum–dance performance
    from Ghana. Its analytic focus is on the way in which participants develop
    simple gestures into more elaborate expressions through the course of a complex
    multi-directional dialogue. While this can unfold in a great many directions,
    certain part-specific performance constraints help determine ranges of expected
    behaviors; therefore, there is a high degree of expectation inherent in any
    given performance. These expectations may be fulfilled or denied, and their
    successful navigation is an important indicator, for insiders, of the quality of
    the performance. Across the three excerpts analyzed, three themes are
    foregrounded: (1) how the extemporaneous call-response dialogue between lead
    drummer and male dancer in rumba guaguancó unfolds, and how it grounds other
    improvisation interactions across the ensemble; (2) how a four-part dialogue
    between dancer and three drummers in candomblé animates tempo entrainment;
    especially group decisions to speed up the tempo; and (3) how a number of
    improvised performance decisions contribute to different kinds of beat
    orientations—laying back or pushing ahead, for example—in Ghanaian drum-dance
    music.</p>
