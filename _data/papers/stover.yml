abstract: |
  <p>In composer Tom Zé’s 1976 <i>Estudando o samba</i>, the iconic marker of
  brasilidade, samba, is taken apart, rearranged, reimagined, reterritorialized.
  Zé renewed this concept thirty years later with <i>Estudando o pagode</i>
  (2006), using the contemporary samba subgenre, pagode, as a space to explore
  musical, cultural, class, and gender relations. <i>Estudando o pagode</i> is a
  “feminist operetta” (Zé 2006) that uses music and text to bend spatio-temporal
  perspectives and disrupt the misogynistic narrative structures that flow
  through pagode practice. Between these two “studies,” Zé created two
  quasi-dystopian readings of Brazilian culture under the neoliberal,
  neo-colonial regime. In the first of these, <i>The Hips of Tradition</i>
  (1992), the very concept of history is folded and refabulated as multiple
  spatio-temporal trajectories are redirected and recombined. In <i>Hips</i>,
  Provençal troubadours converse with concrete poet Haroldo de Campos, Georg
  Cantor jests with Don Quixote, Dido and Aeneas spar with Lennon and McCartney.
  A key theme appears in the song “Tatuarambá,” a portmanteau of “to tattoo” and
  “samba.” In “Tatuarambá” the cultural cannibalism espoused by philosopher
  Oswald de Andrade (1928) and adopted by the originators (including Zé) of the
  Tropicália movement takes on multiple new registers. </p>
  <p>“Tattoos . . . embrace the multi-dimensionality of bodies” (Deleuze and
  Guattari 1983), marking bodies and inscribing them as more-than-human. Zé
  transforms the “body” of samba into the territorial machine of a prosthetic
  post-samba. Like Andrade’s cannibalism, this involves more than simple acts of
  stylistic hybridization. Tattooed bodies “allow us navigate the plasticity of
  the regime of signification through which the body emerges” but we also must
  engage “the concrete materiality of marked flesh, which involves actual pain”
  (MacCormack 2011). Zé’s relation to samba, once critical, here becomes a cruel
  clinical engagement violently marking and re-signifying samba, enacted through
  series of musical and lyrical de- and recodings. In addition to closely
  reading “Tatuarambá,” this paper engages Zé’s 2012 return to tropicalista
  themes, <i>Tropicália lixo logico</i>, which filters Tropicália’s radical
  provocations through a <i>garbage-logic</i> (or “aesthetics of garbage”; Stam
  1997), adding a further adumbration to Zé’s extended critical and clinical
  refabulation of Brazilian music and culture.</p>
