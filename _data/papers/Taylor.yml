abstract: | 
    <p>Like other late Nancarrow works intended to be performed by live musicians, <em>Piece No. 2 for Small Orchestra</em> (1988) is written “in one”: each bar can be simultaneously divided into multiple subdivisions of 4, 5, 6, or 7. While this notation makes it possible to perform the work with a single conductor, it can disguise some polymetrical relationships, while privileging others. With the aid of rewritten passages, we find Nancarrow working with two kinds of rhythm, presented in contrasting timbres and tempo streams: 6/8 hemiola and odd-meter <em>aksak</em> rhythms. Earlier instances of these rhythmic combinations are found in Nancarrow’s <em>Study No. 7</em> and elsewhere. These polytempic streams, each articulated by different polymeters, represent potent yet contrasting ways to create rhythmic complexity.</p>
