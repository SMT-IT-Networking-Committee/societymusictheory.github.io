title: "Affective Music Theory, Public Musicology, and the Construction of Phish Fan Identity"
abstract: |
    <p>As numerous scholars have argued, Phish fans make up a significant subcultural group in the United States (Allaback 2009; Blau 2010; Yeager 2011). Many elements serve to construct this subcultural identity, including communal experiences (e.g. festivals), style, musical aesthetics, shared mythology, insider knowledge, and issues of race, class, and religion. Although these aspects may constitute identity formation in many kinds of musical affinity groups, Phish fans are unique in that they have also created an analytical tradition around improvisation as part of their identity. This discursive practice, which has unfolded online and in person for over twenty-five years among fans, is not only an example of music theory used by laypeople in the public sphere, but it is a rare example of music theory contributing to the construction of (sub)cultural identity.</p>
    <p>This paper argues that Phish fans construct their identity around an analytical discourse that fosters an affective connection between fans and the homemade language and visual objects of their theories of improvisation. Fans privilege improvisational exploration that moves through a variety of keys and grooves as the highest form of musical expression, and therefore invented their own vocabulary to explain the music. A variety of analytical methods–including the creation of improvisational typologies and nomenclature for jamming styles, visual representations of improvisations, and analytical videos–show that a rich and thorough engagement with the band's music is part and parcel of Phish fan identity formation and experience.</p>
    <p>Some of these approaches incorporate traditional musical terminology (e.g. Roman numerals) with which many fans are unfamiliar, yet these analytical methodologies still resonate with the fandom because they represent a notion of musical journeying that is fundamental to the Phish experience and musical aesthetic. This discursive practice, what Bakhtin might call a “speech genre,” creates an affective connection between Phish fans and the analytical language, and can function as a point of access to subcultural knowledge and as a way of performing subcultural belonging. As Jensen (1992) argues, taking a close look at fan praxis reveals that fandom is a rich site of intellectual activity and human identity formation.</p>
