abstract: |
  <p>While there has been much debate about the ontological status of
  recordings, less attention has been paid to how sound recording functions not
  just as object and instrument of analysis but, moreover, as an analytical
  praxis in itself. Beyond representing structure or tracing phenomenological
  process, analysis is also capable of transforming <i>how</i> we hear. Field
  recording is typically construed as a document (of socio-cultural practices,
  improvised performance, geophysical conditions, etc.), a tool for ethnography,
  source material for composition, or evidence for the changing economies of the
  sonorous. Examining the compositional, activist, and theoretical activities of
  sound art collective Ultra-red, this paper instead advances a theory of field
  recording as a praxis that—in properly music-theoretical fashion—inflects and
  accentuates what is heard in order to change the conditions of audibility.
  That is, by re-marking the sonic field—overpunctuating it, as Peter Szendy
  might say—it reattunes our ears and re-modulates the most salient points.</p>
  <p>Formed in 1994 through a collaboration between electronic musicians and
  AIDS activists, Ultra-red has gradually evolved its conception of site-based
  recording as a psychogeographical practice from the members’ involvement with
  the ambient music scene to the critical-analytical listening protocols
  developed as part of their recent community-based “militant sound
  investigations.” This paper evaluates critically the concept of analytical
  listening that emerges from the use of field recording in their radio
  broadcasts, performances, recordings, installations, texts, and actions and
  asks how the modulation of aural attention offers a critical rejoinder to the
  vestigial Adornianism informing Ultra-red’s early work.</p>
