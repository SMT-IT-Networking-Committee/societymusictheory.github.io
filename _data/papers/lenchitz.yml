    <p>Julius Eastman’s untimely death in May 1990 was a tragedy for the entire world of music but especially damning for would-be scholars of his music. Providentially, the combination of Clarice Jensen’s recent herculean effort in transcribing Eastman’s 1981 tour de force for ten cellos <em>The Holy Presence of Joan d’Arc</em> (henceforth <em>Joan</em>). The commercial release of its irreplaceable recording brings us closer than ever to one of Eastman’s largest through-composed works performed under his direction. Combining study of the composition itself with consideration of archival recordings of Eastman speaking about his worldview and his musics, I argue that structural recurrences across large time spans demonstrate how Eastman’s stretching of his own conception of “organic music” functionally serves as a flexible compositional algorithm in <em>Joan</em>. Though not the result of a strict nor an entirely hands-off process, this piece’s flexible algorithmic construction nonetheless challenges the over-valorization of improvisatory structures in Eastman’s through-composed works. By considering his compositional decisions in this last of his “organic music” pieces, we can gain a window into his intuitive and unique command of structural coherence within what would come to be recognized as an early contribution to post-minimalist musical discourse. After untangling Eastman’s idiosyncratic idea of organic music and situating this work alongside its intended political message, I demonstrate how strategic repetitions and transformations create an additive formal structure on the largest scale and align with <em>Joan</em>’s extramusical expressive aims by creating a musical universe where no amount of oppression can extinguish the spirit of counter-hegemonic liberators.</p>
