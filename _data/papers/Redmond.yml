    <p>In the mid-1920s, Nikolai Roslavets crested his career as brash modernist in the young Soviet Union, proclaiming his compositional method a “new system of tone organization” spurred by “powerful inner impulse”. Roslavets scholars have generally taken the composer at his word, but I argue that Roslavets (like many early Soviet avant-garde figures) owed his technical procedures largely to the innovations of late Scriabin. This paper examines the similarities and differences between the two composers’ most constructivist tendencies, showing that Roslavets’s “new system” was precisely Scriabin’s “old”, with Scriabin’s favored chords and collections simply swapped for idiosyncratic new <em>sintetakkordy</em> (synthetic chords). Analyzing Roslavets’s rigorous fifth piano sonata (1923) in comparison with its close aesthetic-technical cousin, Scriabin’s sixth (1911-12), I contrast Roslavets’s approach to large-scale and local harmony with that of his forebear. Tracing phrase- and macro-structure shows Roslavets at his most unique, and also makes clear his inspirations. This paper helps illuminate both his individuality and his indebtedness, encouraging a more holistic view of Roslavets and the other Russian avant-gardists who built their “formalist” structures on mystical foundations.</p>
