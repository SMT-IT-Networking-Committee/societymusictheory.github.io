    <p>In my 2014 SMT paper, “Flipped and Broken Clave: Dancing Through Metric Ambiguities in Salsa Music,” I provided an examination of some of the complex interactions that occur between salsa music and dance by focusing on the physical interpretation of specific types of metric ambiguities and disruptions. In particular, I explored both grouping and displacement dissonances (resulting from flipping, breaking, or pausing the clave) and showed how the nature of the dancers’ responses to these metric disruptions depends heavily on the specific features of each unique musical context. I begin this paper by reviewing these ideas through live demonstrations, audience participation, and dance video illustrations. I then build on my previous case-based research by providing a broader corpus analysis of salsa music in order to show how prevalent these types of metric disruptions are in the genre as a whole, noting how displacement dissonances are relatively prevalent while grouping dissonances are considerably rarer. I also show where instances of metric ambiguity tend to be placed in relation to the formal structure of a typical salsa song, and how these disruptions play an important role in defining the characteristics of particular time periods, specific artists’ output, and the geographically-based styles of salsa music and dance.</p>
