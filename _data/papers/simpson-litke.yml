    <p>Every night in salsa venues around the world, exciting interactions between music and dance unfold through a complex and nuanced system of improvisatory practices. In this paper, I explore these practices by analyzing videos of improvised salsa performances, showing the range of spontaneous connections between music and dance on the social dance floor. </p>
    <p>I begin by examining the elements that are prescribed by conventions, noting how these fixed components are often embellished—or even defined—by improvisation. On the large scale, the typical two-part formal structure of salsa songs is marked by contrast between a precomposed theme in the first half and a number of improvisatory sections in the second half. It is here that an initial parallel between music and dance practices may be drawn, the improvised call of the lead dancer/singer eliciting a precomposed response from the follow dancer/chorus. </p>
    <p>Another opportunity for improvisation in salsa dance emerges when the lead relinquishes this decision-making role, separating from the follow so that one or both dancers can execute their own individual moves, which are not unlike instrumental solos. I examine how open-work provides opportunities for dance partners to interact spontaneously with each other and in dialogue with the music.</p>
    <p>Finally, I analyze elements that are freely manipulated <em>throughout</em> a song, as musicians and dancers express their individuality by finding micro-moments for unique ornamentation and styling. These subtle-but-pervasive interpretive choices have far-reaching ramifications, helping to define the important qualitative distinctions between individual styles and more broadly, between regional variants of salsa.</p>
