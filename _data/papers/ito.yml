abstract: |
  <p>What are we to make of Brahms’s barlines? What, especially, when the heard
  meter conflicts with them? Strongly contrasting positions have been taken,
  with some insisting that the notated meter is always best and others freely
  rebarring the music. Drawing on a study of metrical dissonance in all of
  Brahms’s music, this paper addresses Brahms’s barlines by examining measures
  one-and-a-half times the length of the prevailing measures, or 1.5-length bars
  (1.5LB’s). 1.5LB’s occur throughout Brahms output; they may be either notated
  or unnotated, and they occur most frequently either singly or in pairs.</p>
  <p>1.5LB’s can serve as a hermeneutic key to Brahms’s metrical practice,
  revealing the validity of alternate heard meters. This is based on two
  converging arguments.</p>
  <p>First, each individual notated 1.5LB shifts the phase of the barlines, and
  initial and final barlines end up out of phase more often than not. Brahms
  rarely ends a movement with unresolved metrical dissonance; this suggests that
  those endings are metrically consonant, and that the listener should follow
  the clear cues indicating a change in meter. Emphasis on the notated meter in
  these cases opens the door to alternate heard meters in other cases, as the
  aural cues are of the same nature.</p>
  <p>Second, 1.5LB’s often appear before cadences in Brahms’s music, and the
  frequencies with which this occurs for notated and unnotated 1.5LB’s are
  statistically indistinguishable.</p>
  <p>I therefore conclude that notated and unnotated 1.5LB’s were basically
  equivalent for Brahms. The general validity of alternate heard meters
  follows.</p>
