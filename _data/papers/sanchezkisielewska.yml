and Expressive Trajectories"

abstract: |
    <p>Scholars regularly describe the opening themes from the slow movements
    of Haydn’s Symphonies Nos. 75, 87, 88, and 98 as “hymn-like,” even
    crediting Haydn as the creator of this theme-type (Rosen 1971). Despite
    frequent observations on the similarities between themes, little attention
    has been paid to the comparative study of these entire movements. This
    paper focuses on this set of symphonic hymns as a case study to address
    two issues central to the theory of musical topics: first, the necessity
    (and difficulty) of properly grounding topics in the musical landscape of
    their time, and second, how the interaction of topics with one another and
    with other elements of musical structure can generate diverse expressive
    trajectories.</p>
    <p>I demonstrate that these themes resemble, rather than church music, the
    musical style of opera scenes depicting ritual actions performed by female
    or supernatural cohorts. More precisely, the Largo from Symphony No. 88
    features remarkable similarities with Gluck’s <i>Orphée et Eurydice</i>
    and the Adagio of Symphony No. 98 presents close parallelisms with Haydn’s
    own rendition of the Orphic myth. In each of the symphonies mentioned
    above, Haydn revisits the same theme-type but adapts it every time to an
    entirely different formal design (theme and variations, monothematic and
    bi-thematic sonata form, and sonata-rondo), highlighting diverse meanings
    generated by the hymn topic through expressive oppositions. Because these
    movements feature remarkably similar themes but maximally divergent formal
    layouts, analyzing them as a group illustrates Haydn’s oft-invoked
    authorial voice and the productive interplay between topics and
    compositional strategies.</p>
