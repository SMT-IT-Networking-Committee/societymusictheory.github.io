title: Spiritual Implications of the Sacred Hymn Topic and the Romanesca Schema in Beethoven’s Fidelio

abstract: |
    <p>The “sacred hymn topic” (McKee 2007)—used for priests’ scenes in
    eighteenth-century opera—includes among its attributes chorale texture,
    slow tempo, major mode, and a prominent I-V-vi opening shared with the
    Romanesca schema (Gjerdingen 2007). No priests appear in Beethoven’s
    <i>Fidelio, </i>yet he deployed this musical sign in two significant
    moments of his opera. This paper provides empirical evidence of the
    religious connotations of the Romanesca and examines the interactions
    between topic, schema, and tonal structure to expose some previously
    overlooked spiritual elements of <i>Fidelio.</i></p>

    <p>In the recitative “Abscheulicher!”, Leonore’s tormented spirits find a
    safe C major haven suffused with pastoral signifiers. This apparently
    stable tonal space eventually dissolves into a modulation—metaphorically
    upwards—to E major, a key historically associated with heavens. The
    following aria, “Komm Hoffnung,” is a prayer to Hope that begins as a
    sacred hymn topic.  This juxtaposition of topics and keys resembles the
    opposition between the mundane and the divine, depicting Leonore as a
    spiritual figure rising above ordinary experience. In the Trio “Euch werde
    Lohn,” she gives his husband a piece of bread singing another sacred hymn
    after a modulation—metaphorically downwards—from A major into C major.
    Drawing on the historical association between the Romanesca and the
    Benedictus of the Mass, I interpret the tonal descent as another musical
    analogy, which turns the lovers’ reencounter into a moment of Holy
    Communion. My analyses suggest that Beethoven’s music characterizes
    Leonore, an emblem of marital fidelity, as a priestess rather than a
    loving wife.</p>
