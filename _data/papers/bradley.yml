  <p>The joyful closing exclamation <i>Benedicamus Domino</i> (“Let us bless the
  Lord”) resounded in song several times a day in medieval churches. In her
  seminal 1988 article, Anne Walters Robertson showed that this was a special
  moment of musical freedom and creativity in the middle ages. Robertson
  demonstrated an “unwritten” tradition for <i>Benedicamus Domino</i>
  plainchants, wherein monophonic melodies were created ad hoc, simply by adding
  this text to a pre-existing chant. This paper explores the hitherto
  unconsidered possibility that a similarly “unwritten” practice of
  “<i>Benedicamus</i> by contrafaction” occurred also in polyphonic contexts,
  effectively bringing to light <i>Benedicamus</i> settings “hidden” in extant
  thirteenth-century sources. In 1958, Frank Harrison suggested that polyphonic
  <i>conducti</i> could have been sung in the place of the <i>Benedicamus
  Domino</i> in the Parisian liturgy, since they frequently conclude with these
  words. Although often alluded to in later scholarship, Harrison’s theory still
  lacks detailed investigation. This paper uncovers traces of an additional
  “unwritten” tradition by which the text <i>Benedicamus Domino</i> could be
  added at the end of polyphonic <i>conducti</i>. Furthermore, it argues that
  another polyphonic genre, the <i>clausula</i>, was likewise occasionally
  intended for performance as a <i>Benedicamus</i> substitute. This offers a new
  explanation for three curious <i>clausulae</i> in Florence, Biblioteca Medicae
  Laurenziana, Plut. 29.1, whose choice of plainchant tenor melodies and
  function, and whose very inclusion within this manuscript, have long perplexed
  scholars.</p>
  <p>Reflecting more broadly on the centrality of texts and melodies associated
  with <i>Benedicamus Domino</i> in the development of polyphonic composition in
  the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, this paper illuminates enduring
  traditions of musical creativity surrounding the <i>Benedicamus Domino</i>,
  tracing new interactions and connections between its diverse musical
  elaborations. It engages with fundamental questions as to why this particular
  moment in the Christian liturgy proved such an important locus of musical
  experimentation and innovation.</p>
