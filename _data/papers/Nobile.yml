    <p>Combining the slick production of post-grunge rock with raw, feminist lyrics reminiscent of Riot Grrrl punk, Alanis Morissette’s 1995 album <em>Jagged Little Pill</em> introduced a new rock femininity that rippled throughout the late 1990s. As Karen Fournier describes, Morissette’s pop-critical reception as a quintessential “angry young woman” overlooks the broad range of social and emotional content presented throughout the album (Fournier 2015; Schilt 2003; Whiteley 2000). This expressive range comes not only from Morissette’s lyrics but also—perhaps especially—from her versatile and idiosyncratic vocal delivery. While some analysts have discussed her strategic combination of head and chest voice (Fournier 2015; Lacasse 2010), Morissette’s vocal expression is significantly more nuanced than that single parameter. In this paper, I demonstrate that throughout <em>Jagged Little Pill,</em> Morissette uses a specific set of vocal styles to project certain expressive effects, synchronizing with not only her songs’ lyrical content but also their formal structures.</p>
    <p>I begin by identifying Morissette’s primary palette of six vocal styles, which I term “speech-song,” “strong voice,” “belt,” “soft voice,” “sweet voice,” and “squeal,” plus three vocal effects, including her hallmark “yodel break” as well as “snarky whine” and the production effects of double tracking/flange. I show that throughout the album, Morissette strategically deploys her vocal palette to achieve specific expressive effects. More broadly, my analysis shows how voice can serve a fundamentally <em>structural</em> role, one at least as powerful as harmony or melody in shaping a song’s identity and expressive meaning.</p>
