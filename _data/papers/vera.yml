abstract: |
  <p>When we speak of polyphony and plainchant, we tend to think about the grand
  collections of choir books or sheet music housed at the most important
  cathedrals and convents. The back and forth between a choir of clergymen
  performing plainchant at the lectern and a group of singers and
  instrumentalists playing polyphony from their music scores is one of the most
  recurring images among those of us interested in the sacred music of the past.
  But, what about at the smaller religious institutions, which enjoyed neither
  these sorts of collections nor a stable chapel choir? This paper is an attempt
  to respond, in part, to this question, by way of a case study of musical and
  liturgical practices at the Santiago de Chile Cathedral, which operated, until
  1840, under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Lima.</p>
  <p>Using a review of documents and musical sources, I will demonstrate that
  the cathedral had only a very small collection of polyphonic works and choir
  books, and that it was only starting in 1721 that it began to host a stable
  music chapel, precisely because both the church and the city it called home
  were located in the periphery and faced serious constraints on resources.
  Nevertheless, rather than impeding the performance of liturgical singing,
  these conditions prompted the cathedral to develop musical practices different
  from those of the major religious institutions, singing abundantly “in tone,”
  buying or borrowing music from other institutions (mainly local convents and
  the Cathedral of Lima), and using smaller-format books sung only by the
  succentor or some other cleric.</p>
  <p>From a local standpoint, this proposal thus addresses several aspects
  overlooked by Samuel Claro Valdés, Guillermo Marchant, and even the author of
  this paper in previous studies about Santiago cathedral.</p>
  <p>From a global standpoint, it enriches our knowledge of liturgical singing
  in a given time period (the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) and
  geographical setting (Latin America), which has received relatively less
  attention, notwithstanding valuable past contributions to the research, such
  as those found, among others, in Bernardo Illari and Javier Marín’s
  dissertations on La Plata and Mexico.</p>
