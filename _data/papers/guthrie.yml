  <p>The rise of a musical avant-garde in 1950s Britain launched a heated debate
  about whether and how children could learn to appreciate modern music. Where in
  the previous decade critics had celebrated the diversification of concert
  audiences, this new development re-ignited old concerns about the chasm between
  living composers and the general public. As calls for “real” composers to write
  “real” music for schools grew, several of the emerging generation turned their
  attention to writing music for young people.</p>
  <p>The products of their labor have often proved a stumbling block for
  scholars, who have tended either to dismiss this repertory as second-rate on
  account of its genre, or tried to validate it by foregrounding its modernist
  credentials. This paper takes an alternative approach. By reanimating the
  apparent tension between educational function and avant-garde aesthetics, it
  explores how certain composers sought to accomplish a middlebrow cultural
  agenda: of bridging the gap between elite musical culture and the general
  public. In the process, I want to suggest that what was at stake was not so
  much music pedagogy as whether avant-garde music had a place in post-war
  British society. For in a country that had long been ambivalent about the idea
  of art for art’s sake, entangling the avant-garde in current debates about
  citizenship, leisure and education helped advocates to justify its existence,
  even as they paradoxically remained committed to modernist ideals of aesthetic
  autonomy.</p>
  <p>Among the first of his generation to compose for young performers was Peter
  Maxwell Davies, whose multi-movement school work <i>O Magnum Mysterium</i>
  (1960) provides a powerful case study. After sketching the historical backdrop,
  I explore how Maxwell Davies sought to adapt a Continental modernist tradition
  to British sensibilities. Combining medieval sources with avant-garde
  techniques, he designed a work that might broaden access to modern music
  through performance. However, finding a balance between the challenging and the
  accessible was far from straightforward, as the work’s reception makes clear.
  To conclude, I set critics’ responses alongside the voices of the young
  performers, whose tepid reaction suggests the limits of this attempt to
  democratize elite culture.</p>
