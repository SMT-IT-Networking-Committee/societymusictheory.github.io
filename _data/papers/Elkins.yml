    <p>The free fantasias of C.P.E. Bach had a powerful impact on his listeners, eliciting both praise and censure for their departures from standard instrumental forms. Previous scholarship has acknowledged the ways in which Bach’s treatment of form in the free fantasia differs from more formularized genres, emphasizing liberties taken with meter, thematic material, and modulation (Head 1995; Richards 2001). However, some aspects of the fantasias are more closely in dialogue with conventional practices than is often stated, and little has been done to more systematically show the ways in which Bach evokes—and subsequently undercuts—the formal and schematic expectations that would have been familiar to his listeners.</p>
    <p>Building on William Caplin’s work on formal function in Classical-era fantasias (Caplin 2018) and Robert Gjerdingen’s research on galant schemata (Gjerdingen 2007), I will show how C.P.E. Bach’s fantasias engage with eighteenth-century phrase-structural conventions while subverting them in ways that confound form-functional notions of beginning, middle, and end. I will focus on three of Bach’s strategies for altering the expected formal function of a passage: by tweaking an existing schema to alter its form-functional properties, by overlapping musical features that project contradictory formal functions, and by placing conventional harmonic paradigms in unconventional places. Bach’s invocation of galant phrase-structural conventions allowed him to play with the expectations of his listeners, resulting in music that sounded “free” while remaining comprehensible and striking a balance between the familiar and the unexpected.</p>
