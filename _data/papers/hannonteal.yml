abstract: |
  <p>In 2007, avant-garde icon John Zorn wrote, “To survive in this world of
  distractions and adversity, good music has gone underground, becoming more
  invisible than ever.” His music space, The Stone, has existed as intentionally
  and persistently marginal for the past thirteen years, a venue that allows
  what John Brackett refers to as “transgressive” margins valued by Zorn and his
  community to be acted out musically and socially in an inconspicuous downtown
  site with an aesthetic rooted in unresolved tensions. In March 2017, however,
  Zorn announced plans to move The Stone, shifting performances to the Glass Box
  Theater at the New School’s College of Performing Arts the following summer
  and then closing the discreet, underground East Village space in February
  2018. While the physical distance between these locations is small, the
  cultural gap is significant, as the venue has traveled from a hidden,
  insider-directed space to a more prominent, institutionally supported one.
  Drawing on fieldwork at both the of The Stone’s locations between 2010 and
  2018 and performance theories by Peggy Phelan and Judith Butler, this talk
  investigates Zorn’s recent assertion that “our aesthetic will not alter one
  bit,” a claim seconded by Dave Douglas, one of the first performers to play at
  the new location. While the impact of this transition on the music played at
  the Stone and the people who make it is still developing, I argue that the
  move is replacing one site of tension in which The Stone existed, the line
  between public and private space, with a new balancing point that mirrors
  recent changes in the educational culture of jazz, a style once disparaged in
  formal music teaching circles that moved sharply toward institutionally
  supported “legitimacy” in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The
  “downtown” culture of training younger musicians and building musical
  community through informal apprenticeship in semi-private underground spaces
  is now being pulled into a model more traditionally associated with the
  “uptown” practice of formal institutional training, a change that will
  inevitably impact how students and audiences perceive and interpret the sounds
  heard at The Stone. </p>
