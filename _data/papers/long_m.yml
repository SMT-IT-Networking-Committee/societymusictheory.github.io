abstract: |
    <p>Repetition is both a formal parameter and an aspect of performance
    practice. Sixteenth-century notation provides an incomplete picture of how
    formal repetition was understood in practice. Often, when repeat signs are
    taken literally they displace the repeated section by a minim relative to the
    semibreve <i>tactus</i> (yielding a two-beat displacement dissonance relative
    to the four-beat grouping). Such displacement suggests that either regularity
    on the semibreve level was not important to composers, or singers were
    expected to correct the irregularity in performance. </p>

    <p>Ruth DeFord identifies what I have called the <i>minim-displacement
    phenomenon</i> in the mid-sixteenth century <i>villanella</i> and argues that
    offset indicates that the minim is the most important governing mensural level
    in light songs (rather than larger levels typical of more serious styles).
    Indeed, DeFord treats the limited mensural hierarchy as a defining aspect of
    these light genres. By contrast, <i>balletti</i> and <i>canzonette</i> (ca.
    1585–1610)—direct descendants of the <i>villanella</i>—demonstrate a greater
    concern for regularity on the semibreve level. The rarity of minim offset in
    written-out repeats suggests that offset is a deliberate intervention against
    mensural norms. Thomas Morley indicates that performers could extend the final
    note before a repeat to maintain mensural alignment; the repertoire of
    <i>balletti</i> and <i>canzonette</i> bears out this assertion.</p>

    <p>The different evidence for minim displacement in the
    midcentury <i>villanella </i>and the late
    sixteenth-century <i>balletto </i>and <i>canzonetta </i>reflects changing
    mensural priorities. Repeat signs suggest that composers and performers
    increasingly prioritized a larger mensural grid, a practice that we
    associate with later metrical styles. </p>
