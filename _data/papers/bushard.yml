    <p>Aaron Copland’s music has continued to provide material for scores
    ranging from <i>Apollo 13</i> to <i>The Martian</i> that evoke “wide open
    spaces,” the “American Dream,” and mankind’s exploration of the self and
    our existence. Yet, films like <i>American Beauty</i> and <i>Revolutionary
    Road</i>—scored by Thomas Newman—do not extol the benefits of life in
    modern society and, instead, examine the isolation and anxiety inherent in
    the films’ communities.</p>

    <p>Contrary to the optimism often perceived in Copland’s dramatic music,
    his complex piano works can project introspection, anxiety, and isolation.
    Amidst intense dissonance and dense polyphonic activity in the Variations,
    Sonata, and Fantasy, Copland tends to ease the volatility with searching
    melodies, sparse textures, and registral extremes often accompanied by
    static, open-voiced triads that encourage more focused listening.
    Similarly, Newman’s piano-dominated, triadic scoring for more intimate
    suburban settings acts as an audiovisual “zoom” lens that invites viewers
    to look more closely at suburbia’s troubling realities.</p>

    <p>While Copland sought “the note that cost,” Newman prized “what the
    image allows.” For example, in <i>American Beauty</i>’s iconic “plastic bag”
    sequence, cinematographer Conrad Hall’s arresting, tripartite framing of
    Ricky-Jane-bag allowed Newman to respond musically with “Newman triads”:
    consecutive parallel perfect fifths supporting a widely-spaced melody
    comprised primarily of corresponding chordal thirds. In this paper, I will
    examine how “Newman triads” have helped create some of cinema’s most
    compelling audiovisual alliances by channeling a sense of Copland’s
    <i>urban</i> loneliness to convey similar feelings and emotions while
    underscoring <i>suburban</i> narratives, thus reinterpreting conventional
    appropriation of the Copland trope.</p>
