Culture"

abstract: |
    <p>Public-facing music theory is a topic gaining steam among academic
    music theorists, particularly given the digital networks in which such
    discourse can thrive. Indeed, much public music theory is disseminated
    online, over social networks that blur the formal and informal. At the
    nexus of these blurred lines is the increasingly popular arena of
    educational social media channels, many of which feature music analysis of
    narrative screen media.</p>
    <p>This paper focuses on online content that is advertised as a “music
    theory” approach to understanding media, in which amateur analysts
    position themselves not as authority figures but as fellow lovers and fans
    of the media they analyze. Following Kiri Miller’s (2012) ethnography of
    amateur-to-amateur online pedagogues or “A2A,” I argue that this
    particular practice shows evidence of an emerging participatory culture of
    music fans that includes amateur analysts alongside other kinds of
    musicians and enthusiasts.</p>
    <p>In exploring responses to this online content, this paper also considers
    the discursive role of music theory in valuating popular musics as worthy of
    analysis for their structural complexity; music theory operates as a
    methodology of legitimization that uncovers the “secrets” of the music as well
    as the musical values of its fans. I further consider the unmarked politics of
    identity in this sphere, reflecting on how and why these videos are
    overwhelmingly produced by young white men. Examining who participates in this
    emergent participatory practice can shed light on why, how, and for whom music
    theory and analysis exists and persists.</p>
