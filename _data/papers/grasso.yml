abstract: |
  <p>Analysis of video game music is often premised on indeterminacy—this is
  music that is beholden to its interactive medium. Analysts have thus typically
  focused on how that interactivity might manifest musically. This paper offers
  another angle to indeterminacy, one that focuses on the player as agent of
  action and meaning-making within musically defined virtual environments. What
  is it like to experience these musical worlds, to play with or against them?
  Exploring this question, I outline what I call “affective zones,” or spaces in
  games defined by boundaries created by musical sounds rather than walls,
  levels, or screens. As spaces of musically mediated potential, affective zones
  can enhance or attenuate interactive affordances in game environments. I use
  affect as a lens of analysis to account for the indeterminate nature of video
  games in which a player’s actions, thoughts, and feelings are not simply
  determined by musical function, but rather form a locus of subjective
  encounter with musical materials.</p>
  <p>This paper demonstrates affective zones in an analysis of music from
  <i>Super Mario World</i> (Nintendo, 1990). Tempo changes in the “Overworld”
  music separate multiple affective zones within the same play environment,
  affording different meanings in these musically defined “spaces.” This change
  effectively alters the rules for play, creating affective potential in
  adhering to or breaking the rules. By conceptualizing music as a space of
  potential, I argue that musical meaning in video games is not latent in its
  own indeterminacy, but rather in the indeterminacy of the encounter between
  player and game.</p>
