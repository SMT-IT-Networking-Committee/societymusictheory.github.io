    <p>The narrative scope of post-1960 Broadway musicals has expanded greatly, eschewing the relatively straightforward plot structures of the Golden Age in favor of more complex means of storytelling. The rise of the concept musical in particular posed new challenges for audiences, given the increased number of characters and actions to follow. This invites an important question: how did musical theater composers create new forms for ensemble numbers? This paper introduces “montage form,” a strategy by which a single number presents multiple characters, stories, and points of view in an efficient and comprehensible manner. In montage form, a number juxtaposes multiple equally weighted stories from different points of view. Its musical construction reflects this multiplicity of perspectives, featuring contrasting melodies and clear sectional divisions. Additionally, shared musical material links the individual stories into an ensemble, creating connections between the disparate storylines and perspectives at hand. Montage-form numbers are often set apart temporally from the primary plot, conveying past events or providing context for the main action of the musical. After defining montage form, I analyze the eponymous montage-form number from <em>A Chorus Line</em> (Hamlisch and Kleban). Finally, I briefly discuss additional examples of montage form, including “Cell-Block Tango” (<em>Chicago</em>), “Prologue: Into the Woods” (<em>Into the Woods</em>), “Dancing Through Life” (<em>Wicked</em>), and “Non-Stop” (<em>Hamilton</em>). By showing how each of these montage-form numbers contributes to narrative development in its respective musical, I will demonstrate how form-functional study of ensemble numbers can deepen our understanding of the evolution of musical theater style. </p>
