abstract: | 
    <p>Even without clear overtures to unity or coherence, an album’s fixed nature necessarily yields emergent forms through macroscopic inter-song connections. These full-album structures, borne by interactions between diverse musical parameters, are capable of supporting elaborate discursive spaces concerned with any number of topics. Complex expressions of gender present themselves as one example of the medium’s potential; as album experiences are richly multivalent, so too are gender dialectics. Sleater-Kinney’s <em>The Woods</em> (2005) provides an ideal case study. As a whole, it forms a locus of nuanced confrontation between listener experience, the band members’ gender identities, their music and lyrics, and gender conventions associated with hard rock. To show this, I have developed the analytical framework of experiential counterpoint. This phenomenology-based methodology involves generating multiparametric diagrams that map experience-informing trajectories over time. It is flexible and subjective; one isolates the constellation of parameters that most inform their listening and analytic priorities for any given album. In the case of <em>The Woods —</em> whose individual songs develop no single concept — aspects of tonality, tempo, text, sound, space, and voice are shown to collectively thematize disruption as a defining formal characteristic. That this is true of an album populated by female voices renders an environment in which listeners are implicitly and critically engaged with societal pressures germane to gender expression. To further highlight the album’s unique formal and discursive traits, and to demonstrate the generalizability of experiential counterpoint, brief comparisons to other albums are also made.</p>
