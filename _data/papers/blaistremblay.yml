abstract: |
  <p>This paper introduces novelty-style pianist Vera Guilaroff (1902–74). As a
  composer, recording artist, improviser, radio broadcaster, and as the first
  Canadian woman to record popular syncopated music, Guilaroff has received
  surprisingly little scholarly attention. While most reports position her early
  career firmly within the entertainment business, assumptions with regards to
  categories of musical genre, combined with gendered notions of music
  professionalism, have complicated Guilaroff’s accommodation into existing
  historical narratives. Novelty piano, a style that became increasingly popular
  between the mid- and late 1920s, has often stood in jazz historiography as an
  example of ragtime without any “real” elements of jazz present in the music,
  while not quite qualifying in histories of popular music either. In addition,
  Guilaroff, like numerous other white upper-class women pianists of the ragtime
  era, largely retreated from wage-earning performance when she became a mother.

  <p>In this presentation, I examine the identity politics at play when labels
  like “jazz musician,” “popular entertainer,” or “a lady of many talents” are
  used to “straighten up” Guilaroff’s sounds and legacy (Tucker 2008). I draw on
  Guilaroff’s two surviving oral histories (from 1963 and 1964), where she
  articulates her own narrative of music-making as a heteronormatively aligned
  woman in the early decades of the twentieth century, to map the relationship
  between gendered notions of professionalism and her near-exclusion from jazz
  and popular music histories. Lastly, I offer a close analysis of the way
  parlor-based (rather than nightclub-based) improvisatory practices surface on
  her 1926 and 1964 takes of the “Maple Leaf Rag.” Ultimately, I argue that
  despite the unfixedness of jazz’s meanings in the early decades of the
  twentieth century, what counts as jazz is based on gendered hierarchies of
  value between public and private music-making where the improvising hands of
  heteronormatively aligned women fall often short of the kind of straightening
  that the jazz label can do.</p>
