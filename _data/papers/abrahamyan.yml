    <p>Soviet leadership attacked religion as the ideological enemy of the communist state by portraying it as antithetical to cultural modernization and economic progress. The fact that, by the time the Bolsheviks took power, Christianity had been part of Armenian culture for over 1600 years presented unique challenges to the dissemination of scientific atheism. Examining archival materials on Armen Tigranyan’s <em>Davit Bek</em> (1950), this paper argues that the revisions of this opera contributed to the secularization of its initial libretto. Tigranyan’s opera narrates the events of Armenian liberation from Persian subjugation in the early 1720s but, in several scenes, crucially diverges from Raffi’s eponymous novel. These divergences, musically carried out through familiar operatic topoi, construct alternative dynamics between Armenian, Georgian, Persian, and Russian political powers represented in the plot. One topos, <em>deus ex machina</em>, is utilized when Peter the Great’s messenger descends upon the Armenian people in a scene that initially centered on liturgical prayer. Another set of topoi, orientalism, is employed to construct difference. Whereas traditionally orientalism highlights difference between the imperial West and the colonized East, here, this binary distinction is obscured for political reasons. Even though Armenians, Georgians, and Persians geographically represent the East, Persia was an imperial rival to Russia and, as such, had to be orientalized, or “othered.” Disentangling musical representations of the different nations, this paper illustrates how these representations perpetuated ideological goals, above all, the construction of a secular Armenian nationalism in which Russia’s role is reconfigured from a colonizer to a delivering God.</p>
