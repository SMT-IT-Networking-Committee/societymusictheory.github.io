abstract: |
  <p>From 29 July to 15 October 1946, delegates from twenty-one countries met in
  Paris to promulgate an international peace centered on a shared commitment to
  ensuring fundamental human rights and freedoms transcending race, sex,
  language, and religion. As world leaders discussed the advantages of global
  cooperation, Pierre Schaeffer and members of his experimental radio studio,
  the Club d’Esssai, used the recently nationalized medium to explore how
  cross-cultural personal encounters might emerge in the postwar era.
  Schaeffer’s <i>Une Heure du monde</i>, broadcast in six prime-time
  installments over the Chaîne Parisienne, responded sonically to the conference
  and its goals with admiration, satire, and sober critique. </p>
  <p>This paper explores the myriad sound recordings that comprise <i>Une Heure
  du monde</i>, documenting how they were carefully collected and presented to
  audiences. Drawing on archival recordings, reviews, and production documents
  surrounding <i>Une Heure du monde</i>, I reveal the ways in which Schaeffer’s
  recordings worked to 1) facilitate cultural exchange within the political
  structures of postwar internationalism, 2) document such exciting historical
  events as the Liberation of Paris, 3) critique the French state agenda for
  using radio as a political tool, and 4) challenge audiences to encounter
  speech, musics, and noises in an imagined (radio) Tower of Babel. The
  authenticity of sound sources in <i>Une Heure du monde</i> was meaningful to
  Schaeffer, who went to great lengths to acquire them from near and far at
  institutions including the sound archives at the Musée de l’Homme and the
  recording databases of Radio Delhi. He also presented them carefully to
  audiences, who were privy to the origins of a given recording thanks to the
  narrators of the episodes, including most frequently, Schaeffer himself. In
  exploring the recordings that enliven <i>Une Heure du monde</i>—their capture,
  collection, montage, and presentation—this paper locates the early
  manifestations of Schaeffer’s project within the context of postwar cultural
  diplomacy. Further, amid growing scholarly interest in Schaeffer, including
  the recent translation of his <i>Treatise on Musical Objects</i>, this paper
  offers crucial context for his musical thought. </p>
