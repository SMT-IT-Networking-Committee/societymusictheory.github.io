    <p>The juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane in the finale of <em>Tosca</em>’s opening act has never suffered for want of attention, but neither have scholars adequately described how Puccini joins two disparate elements into a cohesive musical whole. Although most commentary on the scene focuses more on the dramatic context than the music (e.g., Carner 1958, Girardi 2000, and Budden 2002), Arman Schwartz hints toward an intriguing proposition when he interprets the scene as “good and evil marching together” (Schwartz 2008). </p>
    <p>In this paper, I reveal how Puccini’s music both affirms this image of good and evil in tandem and suggests an alternative reading: good <em>corrupted</em> by evil. Analysis begins by dividing the score into two constituent elements, defined by each one’s instrumentation, dramatic context, and diegetic status. This divisionary methodology yields a familiar structure within each element: AABA in the orchestral church music, and a recitative-arioso-aria-chorus progression in the vocal parts. Together, these elements comprise what I designate a “double formal complex,” consisting of two distinct formal structures that function autonomously while simultaneously contributing to the score as a whole. Having been overshadowed by its staging for many decades, this dual structure elevates Puccini’s music to the same level of importance as the scene’s visual aesthetics. Beyond these formal considerations, additional harmonic details and historical context (Nicassio 1999, Baragwanath 2011) provide commentary on the opera’s broader theme of the abuse of power as the plot’s antagonist bends both Church and State to his malignant will.</p>
