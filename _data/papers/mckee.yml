    <p>Audiences of early Hollywood sound films found one scene particularly problematic: the love scene. The novelty of <em>hearing</em> two lovers confess their feelings, leading to a dramatic clinch and five-second kiss, made audiences squirm in their seats. The typical reaction, as reported in newspapers and entertainment publications, was uncontrollable laughter. Studios responded by developing and experimenting with a range of techniques aimed at suspending viewers’ sense of disbelief and drawing them into the emotional undertones of the scene. By 1933 studios had developed a well-defined set of conventions for love scenes and audiences no longer complained. This paper seeks to better understand this transitional period in cinema history by answering the questions: why were early love scenes so devastatingly unsuccessful and how did Hollywood fix the problem?</p>
