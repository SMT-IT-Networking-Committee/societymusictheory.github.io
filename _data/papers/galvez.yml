abstract: |
  <p>“A la fontana” by the troubadour Marcabru has long fascinated scholars
  because it features a strong female voice that speaks against crusade in a
  lament for a departed lover. The song has been discussed as a mixture of
  genres: it has characteristics of a <i>pastorela</i>, as the lady ignores the
  entreaties of a knight in a nature setting, as well as a <i>chanson de
  femme</i> as a woman’s lamentation of a departed lover; finally the song
  resembles crusade songs in other vernaculars in which a lady’s lamentation
  curses the call to crusade. Building upon previous scholarship by Pirot,
  Olson, Nichols and others, this paper analyzes how a multivocality emerges
  through the lady’s mixture of high and low registers, articulated through
  rhetoric and rhymes. </p>
  <p>In a departure from the moralist position of crusade song “Pax in nomine
  domini” Marcabru’s lady is not easily dismissed as a unified female voice
  attached to earthly concerns. Rather, her language of dispossession and
  present positionality, framed by the recognition of empty courtly rhetoric at
  the song’s beginning, mediates the key phrase in which she says her lover
  “thinks little of her.” Rather than seeing this strophe as the lady’s constant
  loyalty to a lover who has turned away from her, and therefore a
  legitimization of crusade orthodoxy, the rhetoric indirectly makes Christ and
  the call for crusade the cause of her lover’s neglect. </p>
  <p>The multivocalism of the lady—the mixture of noble and popular registers
  that evolves in “A la fontana”—embodies an ambivalence about crusade, an
  expression of piety and protest. The popular “tone” of the “-ey” rhymes as
  noted by Gaunt and others and the presence of this sound in the words for
  belief and mercy (<i>crey</i>, <i>mercey</i>) place personal desire and belief
  in tension with spiritual vocation. This ambivalence encoded in a mixture of
  high and low registers appears in other songs, such as Old French crusade song
  “Chantarai por mon corage.” This paper will consider the song’s connection to
  other crusade lyric and its complicated transmission in the only surviving
  copy of “A la fontana” in Occitan chansonnier C.</p>
