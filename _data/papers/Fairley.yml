    <p>Since the mid-nineteenth century, the term <em>polyphony</em> has been a remarkably rich resource for scholars and composers, whether serving descriptive, historiographical, or polemical ends. While definitions of polyphony have varied widely, consistent across this period is the word’s ability to cleave apart historical periods and genres of music. The notion of polyphony—whether narrowly defined to suit the object of study or employed metaphorically, as in recent cognitive turns—conjures such an appealing world of multiplicity, interactional possibility, democratic participation, and unfinalizable structure, that its consistently high status in musical discourse reinscribes a presumption of superiority for the European canon. Tracing anew polyphony’s historical entanglement with racial and colonial epistemologies of musical form and performance can serve to unsettle this supposedly universal category of musical texture. As scholars in postcolonial and Black studies have demonstrated, the universal human subject of post-Enlightenment moral philosophy was tailor-made for white European men and foreclosed other possibilities of personhood. So, too, the terms and tools of music theory, while making claims to universality, are uniquely suited to a musical tradition self-consciously tracing its origin to the birth of two-voice organum from monophonic chant. Even the restorative move by ethnomusicologists to ascribe polyphony to non-Western musics may serve to elevate some traditions at the expense of others, an inadvertent perpetuation of European hierarchies of form. Building on Ferreira da Silva’s theory of “difference without separability” (2016), we must reconsider the very separability of voices in polyphony if we are to move beyond its exclusionary legacy.</p>
