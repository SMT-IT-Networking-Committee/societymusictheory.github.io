abstract: |
  <p>From 1927 to 1951, Edgard Varèse worked on a series of grand projects
  entitled <i>L’Astronome,</i> <i>The One-All-Alone,</i> and <i>Espace,</i>
  featuring crowds of singers or actors alongside acoustic and electronic
  sounds. Previous scholarship has deemed these works as abandoned, aside from
  Étude pour Espace (which Varèse quickly withdrew) and some fragments that
  surfaced in 1954’s <i>Déserts.</i> This quarter-century-long struggle left
  behind a mass of ideas and plans, which, brought together, are indicative of a
  central preoccupation on Varèse’s part: a persistent but evolving
  compositional impulse to confront the city and its soundscape. One draft
  scenario for <i>The One-All-Alone</i> described its setting thus: “Life. The
  City: its noises, scenes, images, songs, the whole making a rhythmic unity,
  visual and oral. NEW YORK.”</p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that Varèse’s unfinished works transmute into
  <i>Déserts,</i> and that they all arise directly from his experiences of the
  city. Drawing on published statements and accounts by Varèse and others, as
  well as unpublished documents, sketches and correspondence, I use an
  acoustemological framework to draw parallels between New York—Varèse’s home
  city, and the epitome of fast-paced urban modernity—and his unfinished works.
  Varèse rejected the notion that his music simply and superficially imitated
  the noises of the city, and I concur, instead examining how its deeper
  structures reflect the increasing complexity of urban spaces, the acceleration
  of movement and travel through them, the machine-age emphasis on efficiency,
  the multilingual fabric of New York, and simmering social unrest.</p>
  <p>However, in the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War, the
  optimism of city dissipated. Varèse’s musical vision changed accordingly; in
  the late 1930s, he destroyed much of what he had written of <i>Espace,</i> and
  the scope of his plans diminished. <i>Espace</i> metamorphosed into
  <i>Déserts,</i> for twenty instruments with electronic interpolations, but no
  plot or human voices; the composer listed “deserted city streets” and “mystery
  and essential loneliness” among its titular deserts. His plans were never
  truly abandoned, and their transformations over decades offer new perspectives
  on musical modernism’s engagement with the city.</p>
