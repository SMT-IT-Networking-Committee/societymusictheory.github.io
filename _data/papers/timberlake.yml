abstract: |
  <p>In May 1951, Joachim Krueger, the director of the music division of the
  East German State Library, stuffed a suitcase with valuable musical documents
  and fled the country for West Germany. Among the booty were autograph
  manuscripts by Beethoven, Glinka, and Handel, and all 137 of Beethoven’s
  conversation books. The heist had been long in the making—Krueger, actually a
  professional book thief posing as a musicologist, had taken up the post solely
  in order to make off with the goods. But his plans went awry when he was
  apprehended by West German customs officials. Through the clever use of
  half-truths, the thief-cum-director surrendered only the conversation books to
  the Beethoven-Haus Bonn while keeping the rest. The books were finally
  returned to East Germany ten years later. Other documents remain lost.</p>
  <p>The story thus recounted was reported in newspapers at the time, as well as
  in <i>High Fidelity</i> (1977) and most recently in the journal
  <i>Bibliothek</i> (2006). This paper builds on those reports, focusing on the
  intra-German aftermath of Krueger’s crime. I detail the negotiations about the
  documents’ return, a protracted argument which quickly came to be about the
  perceived legitimacy of the East German state. The politics of the matter were
  further complicated by the fact that Krüger claimed to be working on behalf of
  West German intelligence services. I situate this debate in the context of the
  East German program of <i>Erbepflege </i>(“care for inheritance”) which sought
  to stake an explicitly socialist claim on the music of the German past.
  Beethoven’s music took a central place in this program: the perceived
  universality of its “humanistic” values was meant to prove the universality of
  socialist ideology. As I show, however, this claiming of immaterial,
  transhistorical values nevertheless relied on the irreducible material object:
  it was the absence of these books and scores that called the “ownership” of
  their ideologies into question. Thus the theft, more than being a
  particularly thrilling example of Cold War intrigue, reveals the complex
  status of the material object in what (in the German tradition) has long
  been considered a proudly immaterial art.</p>
