title: "Deep Ecology in Music: Pauline Oliveros and Deep Listening"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Hierarchical philosophies pervade Western culture and rationalize the
  divide between humans and the nonhuman environment. As an extension, this
  mindset of division presents itself in much of Western classical music. While
  persistent, these philosophies have faced considerable opposition since the
  1960s by a variety of ecologically founded stances and left a mark on
  post-World War II music. This poster examines how the philosophy of deep
  ecology, pioneered by Arne Næss and George Sessions, is reflected in the music
  of Pauline Oliveros. As a composer, Oliveros often used non-Western ideas,
  ecologically motivated listening, found environmental sound, electronics, and
  improvisation, challenging established Western compositional paradigms. Her
  method of Deep Listening, involving listening to all sounds at all times,
  reduces composer-performer-audience hierarchies, effectively illustrating key
  principles of deep ecology. I will illustrate her creative practice, wherein
  hierarchies are questioned and minimized, with close readings of selected
  examples from her <i>Sonic Meditations</i>, among other Deep Listening-based
  works. I argue that Oliveros’s Deep Listening practice can be used as a tool
  to encourage community engagement and merits exploration in the domain of
  public musicology.</p>
  <p>This project draws on Oliveros’s own writings and others’ research about
  her work. It takes into account related work by and on some of her
  contemporaries, like Cage and Schafer, and considers the lineage of Oliveros’s
  Deep Listening Institute, which has proliferated in a multiplicity of
  initiatives across the globe. Viewing Oliveros’s work through the lens of deep
  ecology offers new perspectives to both ecomusicological studies and Oliveros
  scholarship. </p>
  <p>The poster includes texts and graphs on deep ecology and hierarchies in
  Western classical music, with a large portion dedicated to Oliveros, her Deep
  Listening practice and networks. It also includes images and score excerpts
  from Oliveros’s works and the Deep Listening Anthologies. Audio examples of
  Oliveros’s music will be made available via iPad and headphones. The poster’s
  goal is to situate her work in the context of ecomusicology and discuss its
  potential in the domain of public musicology.</p>
