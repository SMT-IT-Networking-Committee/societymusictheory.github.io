title: "Music Analysis, Popularized? Recent Technologies of Interactive Scores for Listeners"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Music analysis is often considered an exclusively academic pursuit. The
  specific terminologies of each analytical method, expected degree of
  abstraction, and densely reflexive approach generally do not travel well.
  Notation, i.e., musical literacy, often operates at the threshold between the
  expert and the layman. In the twenty-first century, digital technologies step
  in to bridge the gap between established analytical methods and non-expert
  audiences. During the last decade, interactive scores—online or in apps—have
  provided tools that make complex musical notation accessible to non-musicians
  and foster certain levels of analytical perception.</p>
  <p>Three interactive scores developed for listeners will be examined: The San
  Francisco Symphony’s website “Keeping Score” (since 2006) utilizes animated
  score excerpts to integrate various historical, theoretical, analytical, and
  performance-practical information. “Explore the Score” by the
  Klavier-Festival-Ruhr (since 2015) offers full scores of
  late-twentieth-century piano music synchronized with video performances and
  master classes. In Amphio’s 2013 “Liszt Sonata” mobile application, the
  central focus is performative: for the B-minor Sonata, Amphio provides a
  performance by Steven Hough, videotaped from different angles, with both
  traditional score and graphic representation of the pianist’s manual input.
  This paper discusses what role these applications might play in the field of
  public music theory. With these devices, an analytical take on music morphs
  into a type of listening practice. Such a practice holds the promise not only
  of appealing to musically inexperienced listeners, but also of popularizing
  the analytical (and theoretical) knowledge inherent within.</p>
