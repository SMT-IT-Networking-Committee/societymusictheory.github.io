abstract: |
    <p>Fonte and Monte were prominent harmonic-contrapuntal schemata in
    eighteenth-century compositional pedagogy and practice. This paper discusses
    the development of an analytical model for these schemata drawing on diverse
    theoretical and historical sources. It concludes with empirical results and
    a case study from Haydn’s symphonies.</p>

    <p>I discuss Fonte and Monte in the <i>partimenti</i> and <i>solfeggi</i>,
    which already include techniques such as elision and <i>Zwitter</i>, and
    whose long ‘block’ schemata are precursors to more concise galant
    formations. Riepel includes many references to the two schemata in his
    <i>Anfansgründe</i>, where he emphasises that Fonte is still current, while
    Monte is past its peak and requires variation. In his <i>Anleitung</i>, Koch
    focuses more on the role of the schemata in phrase construction, and
    presents formal models for small compositions consistent with Haydn’s
    schematic employment in his symphonic minuets and trios. I discuss cognitive
    models in recent psychological schema theory which motivate the hierarchy of
    categories, parameters and types central to my analytical framework for the
    schemata.</p>

    <p>Haydn’s symphonies contain 452 instances of Fonte and Monte, evenly
    distributed across the entire set. Instead of an expected decline in the
    employment of these schemata, we find an increase in Fonte from the early
    1770s, and a resurgence of Monte in the <i>Paris</i> and <i>London
    </i>symphonies. Statistical analysis also provides valuable insights into
    individual parametric trends. I conclude by discussing schematic
    manipulation as a strategy of communication in Haydn’s last symphony, and
    explain how its identification and interpretation were aided by application
    of the analytical framework.</p>
