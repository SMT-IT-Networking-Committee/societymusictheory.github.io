    <p>At 28 minutes duration and scored for a massive orchestra of 89 players, <em>Siddhartha</em> (1976) eclipses all other works in Claude Vivier’s oeuvre in dramatic scope and sonic grandeur. It was composed soon after Vivier returned to Canada following his studies with Karlheinz Stockhausen in Cologne from 1972-1974, which left a lasting impact on the young composer. <em>Siddhartha</em> reveals the extent of this influence in its strict deployment of Stockhausen’s melodic ‘formula’ technique (<em>Mantra</em> [1970]) and its unconventional distribution of the orchestral forces into smaller groups (<em>Gruppen</em> [1955-57] and <em>Carré</em> [1959-60]). While the former has previously been the subject of scholarly analysis (Lesage 2008), little has been discussed of precisely how it intersects with the latter on a structural level. </p>
    <p>My paper demonstrates the process by which Vivier strategically contrasts inter-group and intra-group textures throughout the unfolding of the principal melody in <em>Siddhartha</em>. In particular I illustrate how both the melodic transformations and their instrumental articulation bring into structural tension two contrasting modes of spatial thinking: namely metaphorical space, expressed through musical register, and acoustic space, expressed through physical placement on stage. I also consider ways in which this project could be seen to reflect aspects of Vivier’s own creative journey within the programmatic context of the eponymous Hermann Hesse novel which was his inspiration. </p>
