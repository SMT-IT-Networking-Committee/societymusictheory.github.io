abstract: |
  <p>Betrayed, abandoned, and isolated, the Nymph in Monteverdi’s <i>Lamento
  della ninfa</i> (1638) bewails her state in the rigid confines of a descending
  8–5 ostinato and an ever-present male trio that introduces, closes, and
  comments on her outpouring. The <i>Lamento</i> maintains a prominent place in
  the early-music concert repertory and in scholarly literature today for its
  display of sheer emotional power in the soprano voice, and for the wealth of
  interpretative possibilities that spring from its mixture of <i>genere
  rappresentativo</i>, male chorus, through-composed madrigal, and
  descending-tetrachord ostinato. These features have inspired a range of
  semi-dramatic and even cinematic realizations, as well as numerous
  investigations into the work’s implications of genre, gender, musical/textual
  form, narrativity, and lineage. At the forefront of these performances and
  studies is the central character herself, the abandoned Nymph, with her
  example of visceral anguish and fury, and yet her inherent subjection to male
  authority on many fronts: her lover, the composer, the poet, and the male
  trio. </p>
  <p>While previous studies have offered various explanations of how the
  ostinato, musical form, and interactions of the voices serve the portrayal of
  the Nymph’s isolation and passion, they have overlooked other key aspects of
  the piece that are crucial to its reading, including its physical presentation
  in Monteverdi’s Eighth Book of madrigals, its manner of performance (as
  suggested by the partbooks), and its expressive integration of text and
  large-scale structure. This paper, therefore, peers deeply into the printed
  sources and into the music itself to reveal new dimensions of Monteverdi’s
  <i>Lamento</i>. The study focuses on three principal perspectives: the unusual
  layout and distribution of the parts in the Eighth Book (together with the
  composer’s performance instructions), the work’s modal-structural design and
  the roles of the individual voices therein, and what these source and
  analytical findings tell us about how the lament functioned in the intimate
  performance setting of the early modern chamber. The results enhance our
  understanding of this well-known piece, its means of expression, and
  contemporary perceptions of female song, while also raising considerable
  questions about the lament’s realization in performances today.</p>
