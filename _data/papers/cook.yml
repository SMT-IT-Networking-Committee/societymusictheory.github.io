  <p>The papal schism began in 1378, when the volatile Urban VI so angered his
  cardinals that most fled, electing Robert of Geneva as (Anti)Pope Clement VII.
  One cardinal missed the excitement: Jean de Blauzac was left behind by Gregory
  XI to guard the papal territories in Avignon, and joined Clement VII’s
  obedience upon his arrival. He died a year later. </p>
  <p>As a cardinal, Jean was well poised to take advantage of Avignon as a
  cultural crossroads and cultivated a household befitting his status. Lesser
  known but important musical figures in Jean’s household were Richardus de
  Bozonvilla, the owner and possible copyist of the manuscript Apt 16bis, and
  Johannes de Bosco, a composer of several Mass movements; both were singers in
  Clement VII’s chapel. </p>
  <p>I recently discovered that Jean had yet another musical familiar: Johannes
  Pipardi (Pipudi). Pipardi was a member of his household at least by 1375 and
  likely until Jean’s death. Jean was buried at the church of Saint-Didier in
  Avignon; Pipardi is named as a canon there in both papal supplication records
  and in the manuscript Seville 5.2.25, where he is the magister behind the
  treatises <i>De arte cantus</i> and <i>Regulae contrapunctus</i>. </p>
  <p>I have argued elsewhere that <i>De arte cantus</i> is one of the earliest
  known sources for the <i>Libellus cantus mensurabilis</i> (c.1340), and
  <i>Regulae contrapunctus</i> for the <i>Ars contrapuncti</i> (after
  c.1340)—both purportedly by Johannes de Muris. Since both the <i>Libellus</i>
  and <i>Ars contrapuncti</i> are found predominantly in later Italian
  manuscripts, identifying Pipardi’s treatises as earlier sources with strong
  French ties lends serious support to the hypothesis that the former are
  authentically French, possibly even by Muris. Locating Pipardi in Jean’s
  household in schismatic Avignon thus suggests one intriguing possible route to
  Italy for the northwestern Libellus tradition. Furthermore, placing Pipardi in
  the same immediate circles as Richardus and Johannes de Bosco proposes new
  connections between his treatises and the notated record. In this paper I
  reveal Jean to be an important musical patron, and the networks of musical
  transmission that developed around his household to be more significant than
  previously understood.</p>
