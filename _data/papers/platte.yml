  <p>In the 1950s, Hollywood’s relationship to jazz swung in a new direction. No
  longer confined to nightclubs, jazz now accompanied films as background score,
  a role previously reserved for symphony orchestras. By the end of the decade,
  Hollywood had recruited jazz musicians to fashion scores for <i>I Want to
  Live!</i> (1958), <i>Anatomy of a Murder</i> (1959), and <i>Odds Against
  Tomorrow</i> (1959). This enlisting of jazz musicians to serve socially
  progressive films introduced a series of aesthetic and ethical opportunities
  concerning jazz’s capacity to represent both symptom and solution to social
  ills depicted in American cinema.</p>
  <p>Scholars have considered how jazz in 1950s films manages the competing
  expectations of postwar jazz, with its liberating improvisation and formal
  experimentation, and film, burdened with narrative constraints and musical
  conventions. This study investigates the finely tuned performances of jazz
  musicianship that unfold through these films on and off the screen. Through
  characters’ musical tastes, the onscreen presence of “real” jazz musicians, and
  the representation of jazz through soundtrack albums, this presentation
  considers how these self-reflective performances set forth a model of
  musicianship steeped in moral authority yet riven with cultural
  misunderstanding.</p>
  <p>These dynamics are especially vivid in <i>I Want to Live!</i> and <i>Odds
  Against Tomorrow</i>, both directed by Robert Wise. The first details the
  criminal conviction and state execution of Barbara Graham. With its “based on a
  true story” premise, <i>I Want to Live!</i> deploys jazz as an appeal to
  cinematic realism and authenticity. The real-life Graham’s love for jazz
  records prompted director Wise to hire jazz arranger Johnny Mandel and some of
  Graham’s favorite musicians. With music by John Lewis of the Modern Jazz
  Quartet, <i>Odds Against Tomorrow</i> confronted racial tension through its
  star (and producer), Harry Belafonte, whose onscreen musical callousness
  complicates his moral righteousness. As analysis of the films, their soundtrack
  albums (each film had two), and their reception shows, the featured musicians
  both rehearse and subvert tropes on gender and race, crime and punishment. This
  paper shows how a particular confluence of social advocacy and commercial
  exploitation came to characterize constructions of jazz in late 1950s
  cinema.</p>
