abstract: |
  <p>Massenet’s <i>Thaïs</i>, while never quite falling out of the repertoire,
  has suffered from a reputation of kitsch ever since diva Sibyl Sanderson’s
  notorious “wardrobe malfunction” at the 1894 premiere. Like its title
  character, the opera has the whiff of a guilty pleasure, with its hair-shirted
  eroticism and its concessions to the bourgeois musical tastes of its time. It
  has been situated within three significant fin-de-siècle discourses that were
  all sources of fascination and unease to the Parisian public: that of
  exoticism (Valeria Wenderoth 2004), that of technologically mediated celebrity
  culture (Karen Henson 2005), and that of early psychoanalysis (Clair Rowden
  2014). In each one, Thaïs plays a different role: a non-Western temptress who
  is subdued by conversion to Christianity; a famous woman whose image is public
  property; and finally, a hysteric.</p>
  <p>I wish to situate the opera and its protean heroine within yet another
  discourse—that of Decadence and Symbolism. <i>Thaïs</i> provides an
  enlightening example of these movements’ revival of religious imagery from the
  ancient world for their own aesthetic projects. My starting point will be an
  extraordinary passage in the source novel by Anatole France in which
  Alexandrian philosophers debate the significance of Thaïs. Their Gnostic
  parables (lovingly researched by the erudite France) portray her as the
  manifestation of spiritual principles which her nemesis can neither understand
  nor tolerate. Their claims subtly pervade the rest of the story, complicating
  its surface tones of skepticism and religious disillusionment. Although this
  symposium scene was too complex to be included in the opera (as noted by
  Steven Huebner), it sheds light on otherwise puzzling features of the libretto
  and provides a key to the opera’s syncretic worldview. In this reading, the
  opera emerges as a compassionate meditation on human frailty, the sacred
  feminine, the creative power of decadence, and the competing mysticisms not
  only of the fourth-century Roman Empire, but of fin-de-siècle Paris. </p>
