    <p>Goehr (2015) contends that the work-concept wholly transformed the
    prelude, so that “the practice of preparatory preluding became the art of
    a Romantic prelude already prepared” (8). By definition, the prelude is
    both incomplete and merely functional, used by performers to ready
    themselves for the main event. But, Goehr argues, this utilitarian status
    was tenuous from the very outset, for the moment the prelude was too
    interesting, it threatened to upstage the main event and shed its
    preparatory identity (10). How does this paradox relate to the
    introduction, another kind of “preparatory” music? In other words, how do
    introductions deny their inherently marginal quality? I respond to this
    question by comparing three compositions: Felix Mendelssohn’s String
    Quartet in A Minor, op. 13 (1827) and the opening movements of Robert
    Schumann’s Piano Sonata in F-sharp Minor, op. 11 (1835) and Fanny
    Mendelssohn Hensel’s String Quartet in E-flat (1834). My analytical
    framework focuses on three intersecting levels: the individual work’s
    formal attributes, intertextual relationships, and the aesthetic trends
    that inform a variety of beginning strategies. I draw on Hepokoski and
    Darcy’s (2006) and Caplin’s (1998) theories of classical form augmented by
    important perspectives on early 19th-century form (Daverio 1993;
    Schmalfeldt 2011; and Vande Moortele 2017). Analytical comparison of these
    opening procedures shows the relevance of the Romantic <i>tendenz</i>
    toward fragment in these increasingly independent introductions.</p>
