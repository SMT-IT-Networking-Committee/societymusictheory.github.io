abstract: |
    <p>As the number of tenure-track jobs continues to fall, more ABDs and recent PhDs spend years as overworked and poorly compensated teachers. I discuss my lived experiences of contingent employment during the transition from graduate school to tenure-track employment; I focus on how administrators assessed my market value with respect to my racial and gender identities—among other factors—and on how the sedimented privileges and logics of higher education continue to fuel the exploitation of labor.</p>
