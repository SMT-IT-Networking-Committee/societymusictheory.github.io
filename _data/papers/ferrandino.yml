abstract: |
    <p>Formal scholarship in rock music has catalogued a number of recurring
    structural archetypes: verse/chorus, strophic, song form (AABA),
    through-composed, and terminally climactic. Evidence for ternary forms,
    however, has not yet been brought to the fore. Assuredly, ternary forms in
    rock music are not the norm, but they occur frequently enough to be worthy of
    consideration. In this paper I offer several instances of ternary forms in
    pop-rock music. Although a structural minority, ternary forms push the
    boundaries of rock conventions and structurally complement a track’s musical
    meaning and/or narrative.</p>
    <p>In addition to straightforward ABA Ternary Form (TF), rock music offers
    several variations on this archetype. I present three additional types of
    ternary form for consideration. Embedded Ternary Form (ETF) occurs where one
    of the ternary sections (A or B) can be described as another formal type such
    as verse/chorus or strophic. Augmented Ternary Form (ATF) occurs when the ABA
    structure is supplemented with an intro and/or outro section. In Integrated
    Ternary Form (ITF), the formal structure presents two contrasting elements—one
    in the A section, the other in the B section—which are integrated and combined
    in the final iteration of A. These elements may be specific harmonies,
    melodies, timbres, rhythms, and/or lyrics.</p> 
    <p>These categories are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive and are
    meant as only a starting point for considering ternary forms in more depth in
    pop/rock music.</p>
