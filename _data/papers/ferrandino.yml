title: Multi-Centric Complexes in Rock

    <p>Recent research in the analysis of rock music has focused on reconciling
    harmonic idioms unique to popular music with traditional functional models.
    Whether through theories of modal tonalities, weak or absent tonics, or
    through syntactical definitions of function, such analyses achieve varying
    degrees of success because they are interpreted through a single overarching
    tonic. I instead propose to explore concurrent pitch centers that occur in
    rock music by modifying Guy Capuzzo’s (2009) sectional centricity, a theory
    that accounts for multiple non-hierarchical pitch centers within a song.
    While Capuzzo’s method accounts for multiple pitch centers between sections,
    I instead look at pieces where multiple pitch centers are suggested
    simultaneously within a section. Such examples I refer to as multi-centric
    complexes, adapted from Robert Bailey’s (1985) double-tonic complex.</p>

    <p>Pitch centers can be determined by three dimensions of music: melody,
    harmony, and bass, and although bass and harmony work in tandem in most cases,
    each may independently suggest a different pitch center—what I call
    <i>bass-harmonic split</i>. The most common types of multi-centric complexes are
    contrapuntal examples where the melody and bass suggest a different pitch center
    with minimal functional harmony, what I call <i>melodic-bass split</i>. Cases
    where melody and functional harmony suggest different pitch center, I call a
    <i>harmonic-melodic split</i>. I explore three different examples of
    multi-centric complexes from a diverse body of rock music from the past
    half-century. These examples highlight the complexity of rock music, which when
    considered under the lens of multi-centric complex reveals a rich, nuanced,
    harmonic structure.</p>
