title: Linearity and Compensatory Coherence in Prokofiev's War Symphonies
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>One exciting aspect of Prokofiev’s music is its ability to quickly navigate
    through various places along a broad harmonic spectrum between common-practice
    tonal norms and atonality, often within the same piece. Deborah Rifkin’s work
    on Prokofiev’s motivic parallelisms can already account for various degrees of
    tonal harmonic function. I build on Rifkin’s ideas by examining the role of
    audible, stepwise melodic lines in Prokofiev’s Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and
    proposing five categories of such lines based on their harmonic contexts.</p>

    <p>My work with linearity borrows from Daniel Harrison’s “Hindemith-lines” (or
    H-lines), which are surface-level phenomena. H-lines may begin and end on the
    same triad or they may move between keys. They may allow for some
    embellishment between members, but they must ultimately move in only one
    direction.</p>

    <p>I propose five categories of H-lines based on the relative harmonic
    stability of their beginning and endpoints. Two categories involve lines with
    an accompanying harmonic syntax that closely resembles the common-practice
    era, one shows little tonal coherence at all, and the remaining two transition
    between areas of tonal stability and instability.</p>

    <p>I provide five examples that show how all H-lines provide a melodic
    coherence whose significance varies based on their overall stability as
    quasi-tonal phenomena. In moving from the most to least stable line-types, I
    also identify emerging patterns that point to Prokofiev’s lines becoming more
    obvious as audible, salient phenomena. These tendencies suggest that H-lines
    may function as a compensatory device for coherence as the role of tonality
    wanes.</p>
