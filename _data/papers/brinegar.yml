abstract: |
  <p>In the 1920s, an African American Baptist minister, Reverend A. W. Nix
  (1880–1949), recorded sermons on phonographs in the 1920s. As southerners like
  Nix ventured North for new opportunities and to escape racism in the South,
  conflicting class values created intra-cultural divisions. On phonograph
  recordings, Nix carried forth the vocal sounds of tradition associated with
  the southern black church, in an era in which middle-class, northern “city”
  blacks chose to disassociate themselves from these voices. Analysis of Nix’s
  voice on his recorded sermons reveals vocal characteristics that were regarded
  with contempt by members of the emerging northern black middle class, who
  associated these vocal sounds with the slave past, favoring instead the voices
  associated with white culture. They believed that by assimilating the vocal
  expressions of the dominant society, which they regarded as more
  sophisticated, they could prove their worth and be treated as equals. However,
  the development of the phonograph and sound films in the 1920s brought the
  voice of the southern minister out of the private sphere of the black church
  and into the public arena of greater society. The success of Nix’s recorded
  sermons on phonographs and in film demonstrates the values African Americans
  placed on vocal traditions, and how they served as resistance to assimilation
  to white vocal aesthetics. </p>
