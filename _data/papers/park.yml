title: "Rhyming Techniques in Korean Hip-Hop"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In the 2000s, a new wave of rappers came to the Korean hip-hop scene with
  the mission of creating unique rhyming techniques pertinent to Korean language
  and culture. There were two schools of flow: (1) multilingual rhymes by
  bilingual rappers; and (2) pure Korean rap with extreme polysyllabic rhymes.
  In this talk, I will first analyze rhythmical aspects of two contrasting
  rhyming techniques of Korean hip-hop in the 2000s, and then discuss the
  importance of the Korean MCâ€™s flow to establishing their identity as true
  Korean hip-hop musicians, instead of as imitators of American hip-hop.</p>
