abstract: |
    <p>In jazz improvisation, “outside playing” is a particularly challenging
    technique that demands a deep understanding of a theme’s underlying chord
    progression as well as the coherent departure from and realignment with the
    progression. How do the notes involved in outside playing differ from the
    conventional notion of non-chord tones? This talk re-examines the concept of
    dissonance in a “straight-ahead” jazz style by analyzing a common
    improvisational technique called outside playing. I will introduce three ways
    that an improviser can invoke the “outside-ness” of an improvised melody:
    pattern-based divergence, successive anti-chord tones, and chord-scale
    misalignment. The effect of outside playing resembles the tension and
    resolution commonly associated with that of a non-chord tone in the
    conventional music theory. However, I will show that the conventional
    containment structure of chord tone/non-chord tone to determine a note’s
    stability (e.g., a note inside a chord being considered as consonant) no
    longer applies in the case of outside playing. As a result, there are cases
    where an unstable note from outside playing can be falsely recognized as a
    stable note in the conventional context. Adopting ideas from recent articles
    by Stefan Caris Love (2016; 2017) and Chris Stover (2017), I suggest that the
    stability of a note is determined by two different epistemological grounds in
    an analysis of jazz improvisation: one based on the conventional work based
    notion and the other based on the treatment of improvisation as an act.</p>
