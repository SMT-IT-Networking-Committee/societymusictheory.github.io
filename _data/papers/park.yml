    <p>Recently, transcription YouTube channels have gained in popularity. These YouTubers monetize their transcriptions either through a membership platform Patreon or through direct sale of the notation. In doing so, the transcribers claim a role as co-creator by requesting a fair share for their labor, contrasting the previous ways musicians bought transcriptions. Current copyright law allows publishers to omit transcribers while highlighting the improviser’s name on the cover, rendering the labor of transcription invisible. These YouTube channels, therefore, lay bare the publishers’ interest in diminishing the labor of the transcribers by presenting the transcription as a mere change of the medium (from recording to notation) as well as the inadequacy of the copyright law.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I argue that treating improvisation as an ideal object contributed to the problem of invisible transcribers. This idealist view of improvisation is inherent in Jeff Pressing’s term “referents,” which portrays an improvisation as a result of the improviser’s interaction with ideal objects (e.g., a musical theme, a motive). An alternative is the “materialist view,” where performance’s documentation is itself considered as a creative act. I consider the recent theories of embodiment in music as a first step to situating improvisation within a materialist context. This investigation into an improviser’s body and an instrument’s physicality reveals the material dimensions of improvisation and proffers transcribers’ interpretations in creating notations. This view erases the conceptual border around improvisation as the only manifestation of creativity and considers improvisation’s dissemination as a continuation of creative instances.</p>
