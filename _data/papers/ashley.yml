abstract: |
    <p>This paper investigates music-theoretic uses of the terms <em>prototype</em> and <em>prototypical,</em> broadly and with specific application to form in popular music. In an examination of almost 200 music-theoretical articles and monographs, three usages emerge: (a) an underlying structure for a musical event, more basic or skeletal than the event itself; (b) a prior model for a musical event, in the same work or in an earlier work; (c) a particularly central or noteworthy exemplar of a musical category. The first meaning’s emphasis is <em>synchronic</em> and <em>intrasegmental</em>, focusing “downward” from the surface to more “basic” musical formations. The second sense of “prototype,” that of a prior model, concrete or abstract, is <em>diachronic</em> and <em>intersegmental</em> or <em>interopus</em> in its application, with an emphasis on discovering and explaining relationships between time-ordered events, within a work developmentally or between works historically. The third sense involves “centrality” or “noteworthiness,” and invokes aesthetic or hermeneutic perspectives and goals; in analytic application it typically combines aspects of synchronic and diachronic viewpoints. These music-theoretic notions are situated within cognitive science’s understandings of prototoypes and memory—episodic and semantic—and then applied to analysis of popular songs. Two studies are described on prototypicality in song forms: a corpus study of some 600 songs (Billboard Top 10 1958–2018) explicating formal commonality and diversity in these songs’ forms, and an experimental study, revealing how listeners use structural (formal) and non-structural (aesthetic, social) factors in understanding song prototypes.</p>
