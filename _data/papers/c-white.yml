    <p>This poster outlines some general formal practices within 20th-century American popular music. My project triangulates two trends in the study of musical form: (1) that notions of form should be grounded in the norms of some corpus, and (2) that texture, timbre, and repetition play fundamental roles in popular music&rsquo;s construction. To this end, I analyze the McGill-Billboard corpus (a dataset of chord/formal annotations of American popular music, 1958&ndash;1991) supplemented with new annotations that identify textural/lyrical/instrumental changes within these songs.</p>
    <p>My analysis relies on timbre/textural changes, formal zones, and time, and uses these event types to study the interaction of these parameters. For instance, I show that when a song introduces a new formal zone, it frequently does so with a textural change, and that the last moments of a song introduce relatively more new and novel events.</p>
    <p>I combine these observations to create two formal archetypes. First, I identify the most-frequent formal zones (verses, choruses, and their pairings) as <em>core modules,</em> and describe ways that these modules can be expanded by additional zones and textural/timbral variations. Second, I theorize the concept of the <em>novelty hook</em>: after songs introduce their initial musical materials (creating an opening peak in novelty) they sink into increased repetition (creating a novelty dip) before deploying a final surge of novelty in the last moments of the track. Using evidence from music cognition, I argue that this paradigm evidences both a standard compositional practice and also an accompanying listening strategy.</p>
