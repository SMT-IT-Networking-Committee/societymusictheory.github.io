title: "A Transformative Event in Max Steiner’s Fanfare for Warner Brothers"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In 1937, Max Steiner created the studio fanfare for Warner Brothers, using
  bold brass arpeggiations and whirling strings to introduce the WB shield. His
  C-major setting of the fanfare in <i>Gold Is Where You Find It </i>(1938)
  became the canonical version that was used by Warner Brothers composers for
  over two decades. Although the fanfare itself is rarely varied in any
  significant way, it acts as a launching pad to a wide variety of themes in
  different keys, meters, and tempos, and with quite different characters. The
  “transformative event” that sets the tone for the rest of the film occurs at
  the moment of the fanfare’s resolution.</p>
  <p>In this corpus study, I examined nintety films scored by Steiner, with a
  particular focus on harmonic and melodic resolutions at the end of the opening
  fanfare. Harmonically, Steiner devised fifty-two different resolutions for the
  fanfare—some of them quite surprising and dissonant. Melodically, the fanfare
  may resolve with a triumphant leading tone, a heroic leap upwards, an
  unexpected common tone resolution, a deflection downwards, or a rather tragic
  fall downwards. Each of these resolutions creates a different emotional
  effect, communicating to the listener what the genre and tone of the film
  might be. Using a chart of values and a simple formula, I mapped each of these
  resolutions onto a continuum ranging from “brightest tone” to “darkest tone”
  and correlated the results with genre. The results show that these varied
  resolutions effectively predict the overall tone and genre of the film.</p>
