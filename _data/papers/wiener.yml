title: Ursula Mamlok's Path to Serialism

abstract: |
    <p>Recent discussions of Ursula Mamlok’s music have focused on her use of
    serial matrices, pc invariants and tonal references in works of the 1980s
    (Straus 2009; Straus 2016; Shanley 2016), theorizing these techniques as
    normative in her music. In this paper, I discuss Mamlok’s gradual adoption
    of serial procedures in the 1960s and 70s, drawing on her private papers
    (now housed at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin). I provide an overview of
    her techniques and development, discussing selected works in detail together
    with associated sketches. My investigation helps to elucidate the nature of
    Mamlok’s unique synthesis of serial techniques and its relationship to her
    earlier non-serial twelve-tone compositions, written during her studies with
    Stefan Wolpe and Ralph Shapey in 1960–64.</p>

    <p>While Mamlok uses a series in the second movement of <i>Designs</i>
    (1962), the first movement is not serial. Rather, Mamlok employs unordered
    hexachords in Shapey’s manner. Mamlok first used a serial matrix during the
    composition of <i>Stray Birds</i> for Soprano, Flute and Cello (1963). She
    used combinatoriality for the first time in the <i>Capriccios</i> for Oboe
    and Piano (1968). In the Sextet (1977), Mamlok extended her control to the
    parameter of rhythm and created several series permutations as well.</p>

    <p>My exploration of Mamlok’s evolution sheds light both on her artistry
    (clarifying her use of techniques that have been misrepresented) and on
    trends in American twelve-tone music that are often overlooked in the
    music-historical and music-theoretic literature.</p>
