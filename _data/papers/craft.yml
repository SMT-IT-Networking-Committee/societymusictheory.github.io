abstract: |
  <p>Throughout his career in the early twentieth century, George M.
  Cohan—Broadway composer, lyricist, playwright, actor, director, and
  producer—both troubled and contributed to changing notions of amateurism and
  professionalism. In print, he dismissed amateur performers, signaling his own
  status by the value he placed on commercial experience and success. “To me,
  salaries tell the story,” he once wrote. Yet the boundaries between amateurism
  and professionalism were not so clear cut. Indeed, for many critics and fellow
  practitioners, he hardly fit the “professional” mold: he championed
  entertainment over art, disavowed his own skill, and broadcast with pride his
  lack of formal education. He claimed to have only read three books (by Mark
  Twain, which he figured were “worth two hundred that I might have read
  haphazard”) and similarly boasted about his limited musical chops, saying he
  “never got further” than “four F sharp chords.” Critics—another evolving class
  of theatrical professionals—bemoaned Cohan’s sort of self-made man of the
  theater and his lack of dramatic and musical sophistication. <i>Life</i>
  magazine’s James Metcalfe lambasted his shows as “vulgar,” and Clayton
  Hamilton wrote in the literary journal <i>The Bookman</i> that while Cohan’s
  brand of theater might have its place, the United States would not be able to
  establish a national drama “until we learn to throw away . . . merely
  entertaining craftsmen” of his ilk.</p>
  <p>This paper examines Cohan’s career as a lens into contemporary anxieties
  about what constituted musico-theatrical amateurism and professionalism.
  Drawing upon Cohan’s statements about skill, education, and cultural value
  onstage and in the press, as well as public discourse <i>about</i> him and his
  shows, I discuss how his “unrefined” but ultimately commercially successful
  brand of productions and personal celebrity helped shape the roles of culture
  and affluence in a burgeoning Broadway musical theater.  </p>
