    <p>Viktor Zuckerkandl remarked that “Whatever else music may be, one thing it must be: motion.” Yet the idea of music as a composed succession of discrete elements has limited the ways in which musical movement has been theorized. This study focuses on what is arguably the quintessence of continuous musical motion among polyphonic instruments: the steel guitar. Aside from synthesizers, this instrument is particularly well-equipped for exploring continuity multidimensionally. It is fretless, it can produce full harmonies, and with pedals, it allows for smooth changes in dynamics and pitch, in multiple directions at once. Unlike a keyboardist or fretted guitarist, whose fingers lock into the atomized, itemized logic of set theory and elemental harmony, the steel guitarist can move undividedly in myriad ways.</p>
    <p>Less about the exact succession of musical elements, the steel guitar sounds out movement <em>from, through</em>, and <em>toward</em> them while also illustrating a phenomenon of <em>moving in place</em>. This presentation will feature live demonstrations on the instrument, which can create a vertiginous effect when the tone bar, pedals, and levers proceed in different directions at different rates of change, confounding notions of “up” and “down.” Analyzing movement in music by performers including Frank Ferera, Gabby Pahinui, Buddy Emmons, and Susan Alcorn suggests a theory in which, rather than an attitude whereby music transforms abruptly from one spatial position to another, music is a kinetic process shared among those creating and experiencing it. </p>
