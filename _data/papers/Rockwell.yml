    <p>Viktor Zuckerkandl remarked that “Whatever else music may be, one thing it must be: motion.” Yet the idea of music as a composed succession of discrete elements has limited the ways in which musical movement has been theorized. This study focuses on what is arguably the quintessence of continuous musical motion among polyphonic instruments: the steel guitar. Aside from synthesizers, this instrument is particularly well-equipped for exploring continuity multidimensionally. It is fretless, it can produce full harmonies, and with pedals, it allows for smooth changes in dynamics and pitch, in multiple directions at once. Unlike a keyboardist or fretted guitarist, whose fingers lock into the atomized, itemized logic of set theory and elemental harmony, the steel guitarist can move undividedly in myriad ways.</p>
    <p>Less about the exact succession of musical elements, the steel guitar sounds out movement <em>from, through</em>, and <em>toward</em> them while also illustrating a phenomenon of <em>moving in place</em>. This presentation will feature live demonstrations on the instrument, which can create a vertiginous effect when the tone bar, pedals, and levers proceed in different directions at different rates of change, confounding notions of “up” and “down.” Analyzing movement in music by performers including Frank Ferera, Gabby Pahinui, Buddy Emmons, and Susan Alcorn suggests a theory in which, rather than an attitude whereby music transforms abruptly from one spatial position to another, music is a kinetic process shared among those creating and experiencing it. </p>
    <p><em><strong>Was ist: Satz</strong></em></p>
    <p>Matthew Arndt (University of Iowa)</p>
    <p>This paper is concerned with a metaphorical kind of musical speech, which for centuries has been figured with linguistic terms like phrase and <em>Satz</em>. The term <em>Satz</em>, translated as “sentence,” has come to designate only a particular design for a theme. Yet Schoenberg states that the term <em>Satz</em>, “is best used only in the grammatical sense.” Neglect of the grammatical sense of <em>Satz</em> has led to a proliferation of redundant and misleading terms for <em>Sätze</em> and their parts when they appear in different designs.</p>
    <p>In linguistic speech, every <em>turn</em> of <em>phrase</em>, every <em>rotation</em> of the <em>words</em> from highlighting one aspect of a scene to another, fulfills one or more functions in coordinating the senses of the words according to certain tropes, most basically certain image schemas. So, too, in musical speech, every <em>rotation</em> of the <em>Gestalten</em> fulfills one or more functions according to certain tropes or formative principles. From a certain perspective, these principles are <em>rotation</em> itself, and the <em>polarity</em> of expansion and contraction along the <em>pole</em> or axis of rotation. Drawing on comparative analysis of Western art music and chant from the Republic of Georgia (which is emically understood as being comprised of <em>mukhlebi</em>, literally <em>Sätze</em>), I argue that rotation and polarity give form to musical speech, differentiating sentences (<em>Sätze</em>), clauses (<em>Teilsätze</em>), and phrases in the same way in terms of function. This elucidation of sentences, clauses, and phrases makes it relatively easy to understand the countless <em>Sätze</em> in musical speech, regardless of their style, formal position, or complications.</p>
