    <p>Riemann’s theory of harmonic dualism occupies a unique place in the history of music theory: while widely considered to be of enduring heuristic value, its central empirical premise is universally acknowledged to be false. That premise, of course, is that subharmonics (undertones) are <em>acoustically</em> real, and hence <em>audible</em> when music is played and heard. The entire conceptual system of harmonic dualism derives ontologically from this premise. And this new system, because it places the minor system on equal footing with the major system (the former now derivable from the subharmonic series just as the latter derives from the harmonic series), incited a revolution in musical thinking that is still playing out today. However, subharmonics are objectively <em>not</em> present in musical sounds. When Riemann ultimately conceded this fact, the ontological basis of the dualist system crumbled. But what if Riemann wasn’t wrong? Or, more accurately, what if his error was a far less significant one—concerning not <em>whether</em> to look for subharmonic relationships, but <em>where</em>. As revealed in a recent monograph from the field of auditory neurophysiology, Gerald Langner’s <em>The Neural Code of Pitch and Harmony</em> (2015), the logic of subharmonic relationship is literally embodied throughout the entire computational structure of the auditory brainstem and midbrain, in those neural circuits that not only afford basic pitch processing, but are the first stages in higher-level conceptions of harmony, melody, and even rhythm and meter. These ideas suggest fruitful new avenues for exploration within dualist theory, as informed by auditory neuroscience.   </p>
