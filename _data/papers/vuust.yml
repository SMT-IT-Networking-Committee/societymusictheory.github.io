title: "Groove on the Brain: Predictive Brain Processes Underlying the
Experience of Musical Rhythm"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Musical rhythm has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies.
    I describe how the theory of predictive coding (PC) can be used as a
    framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are
    processed in the brain. This theory posits a hierarchical organization of
    brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms
    associated with predicting future events. Musical rhythm exploits the
    brainâ€™s general principles of prediction and that the pleasure and desire
    for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm could be a result of
    such mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Exemplified by the music of Miles Davis, I here review empirical studies of
    the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and
    propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory.</p>
