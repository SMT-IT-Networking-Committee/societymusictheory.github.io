abstract: |
  <p>At the level of undergraduate education, it is increasingly recognized that
  students come into the music classroom with a range of life experiences and
  learning styles that necessitate diverse multisensory and multimodal
  pedagogical strategies. Yet, as students progress through stages of academic
  training, they are subsequently “disciplined” such that becoming a successful
  academic music scholar continues to be grounded in a mastery of highly
  cerebral discourse and a performance of intelligence predicated on the
  assertion of authority—what we might call an “academic whiteness.” Where,
  then, is the space for difference within this academic model? How can scholars
  from diverse backgrounds bring their differential ways of being and knowing
  into their musicological work?</p>
  <p>While the renewed disciplinary attention to expanding and diversifying
  musical curricula is crucial, this paper argues that creating an effective
  so-called “diversity pipeline” will require transformational changes in terms
  of the very epistemologies and ontologies that music scholars themselves are
  able and allowed to represent. To have a more equitable, diverse, and exciting
  musicology, we must expand what it means—that is, what it looks like, sounds
  like, and feels like—to demonstrate intellect and insight in academic
  musicology. As thinkers ranging from Michel Foucault to Judith Butler to
  Ta-nehisi Coates have recognized, historical power relations inhere in the
  body; and how we are allowed to be as embodied individuals fundamentally
  reflects the priorities, and constraints, of our profession and discipline. To
  this end, this paper will offer some initial strategies through which music
  studies can address and begin to move away from academic whiteness towards a
  more capacious model of academic musicological personhood. These include
  departmental workshops on race and privilege, explicit mentorship for young
  scholars from underrepresented, non-majority backgrounds, and recognition of
  varying sites and modes for the performance of academic knowledge and mastery,
  both within graduate education and within the tenure process. In sum, this
  paper will consider the forms of support, solidarity, and transformation
  needed to encourage scholars and students to inhabit their multiple selves
  within institutional spaces.</p>
