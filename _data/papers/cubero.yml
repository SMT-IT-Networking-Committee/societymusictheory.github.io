    <p>This paper examines the transformation of the classical theme-type known as the period in the music of the first romantic generation. Whereas in classical periods the antecedent phrase is harmonically closed-off from the beginning of the consequent phrase, in romantic periods the end of the antecedent often connects with the beginning of the consequent to form a continuous harmonic progression. Voice-leading analyses illustrate three different ways through which the romantics joined the two phrases of a period. The most basic of these is by eliding the antecedent’s closing dominant with a V-I progression at the beginning of the consequent. A related means is by prolonging the antecedent’s closing dominant through the beginning of the consequent and then resolving it to a tonic triad. A more radical deformation involves ending the antecedent phrase on a predominant harmony and then continuing the motion from the predominant through a dominant to a tonic triad in the consequent phrase. By joining the end of the antecedent to the beginning of the consequent and forming a continuous progression, the romantics undermined the clear harmonic boundary that separates the two phrases of a classical period. In so doing they transformed the period from a theme-type that epitomized the classical aesthetic of balance and clarity into one that manifested what Rothstein (2006) has described as the “the Romantic urge toward the boundless.</p>
