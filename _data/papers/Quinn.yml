abstract: | 
    <p>The concept of “<em>pien</em>” was broadcast into Western music-theoretic discourse by Hugo Riemann to remap the diatonic scale according to a principle known to Chinese theorists for millennia as <em>wu sheng er bian</em> 五聲二變 (“five proper notes and two altered notes”). Riemann introduced <em>pien</em> in a novel account of pentatonic tonality in which the “extra” two notes of the diatonic scale are analogous to chromatic notes in a system of modulations. Riemann’s <em>pien</em> theory failed to catch on, due to a tendency to exoticize, orientalize, and primitivize the pentatonic, and to portray “<em>pien</em> tonality” as a less evolved system. </p>
    <p>The basic structure of Western staff notation all too easily affords a view of pentatonic formations as “gapped,” deficient, and primitive. Seeing a potential for a radical rehearing of pitch space through a pentatonic lens, both Riemann and his devotee Joseph Yasser developed novel analytic notations. Yasser’s version, in which staff lines and spaces operate as placeholders for pentatonic rather than diatonic scale members, presents the politically intriguing possibility of a notation in which diatonic structures are marked by overburdening a pentatonic framework. The hierarchy is inverted: pentatonic scales aren’t gapped, and diatonic scales are supernumerary. </p>
    <p>This talk modifies Yasser’s notation, using color to indicate pitch alterations, renotating examples by Tran Van Khe on pentatonic modulation in Vietnamese classical music, and from work on “<em>pien</em> tonality” in Western repertories. Finally, a set of exercises will illustrate the pedagogical possibilities of a notation system built from the pentatonic perspective.</p>
