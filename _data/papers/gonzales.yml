    <p>In the lengthy <em>ASA</em> chapter titled “Sight Reading,” Karpinski explores the complex network of skills and knowledge required to sight sing successfully, including vocal production, solmization, scales, intonation, visual tracking, metric and rhythmic thinking, harmonic thinking, and structural singing.  This presentation will highlight recent research on two components of music reading: visual tracking and cross-modal competence.</p>
    <p>Technological advances in the 21<sup>st</sup>-century allow increasingly refined studies of eye movement. Puurtinen (2018) reviews 15 studies since Goolsby’s seminal 1994 publications on eye movement while music reading. Ocular motion alternates between fixations and saccades—the eyes mostly stopping to process the visual stimuli and the eyes shifting to the next fixation. Holmqvist, et al., (2015) propose that information is acquired only during fixations. The length of these fixations in milliseconds, as reported by various researchers, range from 200–400 ms to 500–700 ms.</p>
    <p>Turcotte &amp; Sala (2018) engaged EyeWorks software to record subjects’ singing and eye movement. Pupil diameter and fixations reveal the cognitive load. Preliminary results suggest that their subjects fixate mostly on the initial measures of a sight singing excerpt.</p>
    <p>Related to visual tracking, cross-modal competence reinterprets the familiar aphorism “seeing ears and hearing eyes.” Drai-Zerbib and Baccino (2005, 2012, 2014) confirm that expert music readers’ eye fixations and durations of those fixations are fewer and shorter than less competent musicians. Investigations of multiple modalities (vision, audiation, and motor processes) hold promising outcomes for aural skills instructors to develop and incorporate effective pedagogical methods.</p>
