    <p>Although the music of the rock band Phish is technically virtuosic and steeped in Western art music practice, the band has, until recently, been overlooked by American music scholarship. While much of the scholarly writing that does exist on Phish has focused on the band’s improvisations in performance, undoubtedly a critical component of their practice, it is perhaps too easy for them to overshadow the well-wrought pre-composed elements of their songs. Indeed, during his undergraduate studies, guitarist Trey Anastasio studied composition and theory with Ernie Stires, and Bach’s <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em> figured prominently in these lessons. As a result, baroque-influenced polyphony infuses much of his early writing, and this talk identifies four “modes of polyphony” employed by Phish: rhythmic imitation, free counterpoint, canon, and fugue, and offers several representative songs for each.</p>
    <p>Writers such as Walter Everett, John Covach, and William Echard have shown that it is not uncommon for progressive and psychedelic rock bands to incorporate Baroque-style counterpoint in their songwriting. Phish’s practice differs somewhat in that their usage of polyphony is often folded into their broader ironic sensibilities. Specifically, I propose that Phish’s music often “evacuates the signifier,” by which I mean that the band presents, and then systematically deflates, meaningful musical and lyrical concepts.   </p>
