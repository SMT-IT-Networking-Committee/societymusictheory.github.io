abstract: |
  <p>Alfred Hitchcock’s <i>Vertigo</i> (1958) tells the story of retired police
  detective Scottie, whose fear of heights renders him unable to prevent the
  death of the woman he loves, Madeleine, and his obsessive desire to restyle
  his new love interest Judy in the deceased’s image. Drawing from the success
  of recent neo-Riemannian studies that reveal sensitive hermeneutic readings of
  chromatic progressions common in Hollywood scores, this presentation adapts
  Lehman’s (2013) concept of “network modulations,” which act upon
  neo-Riemannian networks in a manner similar to the hyper-transformations that
  relate K-nets (Lewin 1990). </p>
  <p>In the film’s climactic <i>Scène d’Amour</i>, Judy emerges from her
  washroom wearing the dress and hairstyle once worn by Madeleine. At the same
  time, the harmony accompanying the film’s love theme is changed from an
  Ax+/C+ LP transformation to an Ax+/A- SLIDE transformation. A hypothetical A-/
  C+ R transformation serving as a diatonic precursor for the chromatic
  harmonizations closes a three-chord complex: Ax major, A minor, and C major.
  The network modulations that transform the different harmonizations of the
  film’s love theme among chords within the complex then suggest a musical
  reading of harmonic transformation that mirrors the narrative’s fantastical
  love triangle (Scottie, Madeleine, Judy). </p>
