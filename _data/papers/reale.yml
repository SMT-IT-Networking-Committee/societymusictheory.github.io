    <p>This presentation is a case study that springboards off of Laurel's taxonomy of dissonant jamming, showing how in a May 7, 1994 performance of the song “Split Open and Melt,” Phish's improvised deviations from its established groove create moments of climax. In doing so, the presentation adapts existing theories of groove, such as the importance of both expressive micro-timings (e.g. Keil &amp; Feld 1994; Iyer 2002) and the bodily pleasures of listening to repetition (e.g. Butler 2006; Zbikowski 2004; Garcia 2005; Witek 2017). Notably, many such studies position themselves in explicit opposition to narratives of music governed by delayed gratification and subsequent release (Meyer 1956, 1967); here, Phish's performance does both, and the paper thus suggests a model for synthesizing these competing modes.</p>
    <p>Phish first establishes a <em>default groove</em>: a four-measure loop with a repeating chord progression where the final measure features an added half beat preceding a cadential “hook” that leads into the next loop. After repeating this groove several times, the musicians begin to strip away its constitutive elements. An “intensity chart” indicates whether each player affirms, conflicts with, or does neither, with respect to one of four parameters of the groove, and it both serves as a visual representation of an aural experience of the jam as well as enumerates an intensity value for each loop; these values are then plotted on an “intensity curve.” When Phish almost entirely abandons the groove, a chaotic, unpredictable cacophony–a kind of “structural fog”–dominates, creating an intense musical effect that persists until they “snap back” into the groove. Peaks of intensity occur when few parameters are present, and concomitantly, greatest resolution occurs when they are restored. The listener is asked to perceive the groove persisting through the disorienting brume, and I propose that the experience creates in an attuned fan the kind of pleasurable pain that Lacan calls <em>jouissance</em>. Understanding fan attachment to dissonant jamming in Lacanian terms reveals a particular shared value among the fan base to Phish's musical journeying and experimentation.</p>
