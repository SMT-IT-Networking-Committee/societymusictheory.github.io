abstract: |
  <p>The third act of Tippett’s 1952 opera <i>The Midsummer Marriage</i>
  contains clearly Dionysian elements, reflecting the composer’s interest in
  both Nietzsche’s concept of the Dionysian and Jung’s discussion of it. In this
  act’s climactic scene, the Dionysian effect of musical intoxication acts as a
  component of ritual, designed to include the audience in the work of both
  becoming whole as individuals and restoring fertility to the damaged society
  of contemporary England. In a representation of Jung’s psychologically
  interpreted “Great Work” of alchemy (intended for “the rescue of the human
  soul and the salvation of the cosmos”), Tippett’s Act 3 contains a stylized
  sex rite enacted by the central characters embodied as Shiva and Shakti. In
  addition to suggesting the merging of anima and animus into a unified whole,
  the scene was also intended to evoke the fertility rite from Naomi Mitchison’s
  1931 novel <i>The Corn King and the Spring Queen </i>(itself drawn from
  Frazer’s famous<i> Golden Bough</i>), in which both music and intoxicating
  beverages play an important role. Musical elements creating a sense of magic
  and intoxication are multiple, including long vocal melismas in canon,
  juxtaposed rhythmic patterns in threes and fours that reflect Jungian and
  alchemical references in the text, and orchestration that verges at times on
  chaos. The several esoteric texts (all written by Tippett) are sung
  simultaneously, while dancers present a “Fire Dance” for St.
  John’s/Midsummer’s Eve. In its magical aspect, Tippett’s scene recalls the
  eruption of intoxicated music at the visit of the gods in C.S. Lewis’s 1945
  <i>That Hideous Strength</i>.</p>
