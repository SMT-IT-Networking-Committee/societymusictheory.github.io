title: "The Rise of Hip Hop Diplomacy"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In February 2001, rapper Toni Blackman embarked on a three-week concert
  tour of West Africa, the first by a hip hop artist sponsored by the United
  States Department of State. This paper tells the little known story of the
  emergence of hip hop diplomacy and explains the circumstances that led the
  State Department to invest, albeit quietly, significant resources into sending
  hip hop artists around the world as cultural ambassadors. </p>
  <p>The question that animates this paper is this: why hip hop? I offer four
  reasons. First, hip hop is by some measures the world’s most popular musical
  genre; it is thus known almost anywhere the United States has a strategic
  interest. Second, hip hop is readily identified as American in origin but has
  been indigenized into communities around the world, embraced as a means to
  voice local concerns; hip hop can therefore serve as as a goodwill ambassador
  without obviously representing US overreach or imperialism. (This has been
  especially valuable for engaging with Muslim communities after the unpopular
  US invasion of Afghanistan.) Third, hip hop is broadly accessible—both to
  those with few resources and to those with disabilities—and thus embodies a
  kind of meritocracy that connects with self-identified American ideals.
  Finally, hip hop’s origin story, as a genre and culture created by
  disenfranchised teenagers, resonates with youth around the world, offering a
  powerful connection to the US and to visiting US artists.</p>
  <p>In telling the story of hip hop diplomacy this paper adds a chapter to the
  study of the US government’s complex relationship with the arts. It takes a
  simultaneously charitable and skeptical view of the enterprise, concluding
  that hip hop diplomacy has the power to do actual good in fostering global
  community, but that it necessarily operates within a context of palpable,
  inescapable tensions, asymmetrical power relationships, and unresolvable
  ambiguity. This paper builds upon the historical research of Abrams-Ansari,
  Fosler-Lussier, Hess, Von Eschen and others, and draws upon more than 100
  author-conducted interviews with artists from twenty-five countries as well as
  State Department officials and others who facilitate hip hop diplomacy.</p>
