title: "Singing Repentance in Nuremberg during the Thirty Years War, 1618–1648"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>The Thirty Years’ War was largely understood by seventeenth-century
  Germans to be the result of God’s anger exacted on a disobedient population.
  Accumulating sin within Central Europe provoked God to send punishments in
  the form of plague, famine, and plundering. In an effort to cool God’s
  anger, city authorities across the Empire repeatedly called for the
  observance of special days of fasting, prayer, and repentance. Abating the
  war’s hardships relied especially on the cultivation of “true repentance”—a
  sincere feeling characterized by sorrow for one’s sins that might be
  manifested by compunctious tears and sighs. Music was understood to possess
  the inherent capacity to alter performers’ and listeners’ emotional states.
  It is unsurprising then that composers in and around Nuremberg responded to
  the city council’s calls for repentance with new musical works that feature
  such emotionally evocative titles as Melchior Franck’s <i>Suspirium
  Germaniae Publicum</i> (1628) and Erasmus Widmann’s <i>Piorum Suspiria</i>
  (1629). </p>
  <p>Based on primary archival research in the Nuremberg city archives, this
  paper examines the musical texts that resulted from the city of Nuremberg’s
  repeated calls for days of prayer and repentance during the war. These extant
  texts include such printed musical works as those by Franck and Widmann, as
  well as numerous devotional prayer-books printed for repentance services that
  feature a repertoire of specially selected hymns. Within the emotional context
  of true repentance, I analyze and contextualize the extant musical texts to
  argue that musical performance for Lutherans in Nuremberg was an exercise of
  <i>feeling agency</i>, a concept I develop throughout this paper. Similar to
  magical thinking, feeling agency refers to the way in which one’s emotional
  states were believed to have the ability to effectuate real change in the
  world. Singing musical texts and being moved to feel sorrowful for one’s sins
  because of them demonstrated sincere repentance and thus cooled God’s wrath.
  Successfully fostering repentant feelings by means of musical performance
  could therefore theoretically change the outcome of war—to emote through
  performed song was to act within a tumultuous world where action seemed
  otherwise impossible.</p>
