title: "Rock Slides and Other Uncommon Progressions in Popular Music Harmony"
handouts: []
abstract: |
    <p>Several studies have identified the most common harmonic progressions in
    popular music using either qualitative or quantitative methods (Stephenson
    2002; Everett 2004, 2009; Temperley 2018). This paper complements those
    studies by adopting converging methods to identify the least common consonant
    progressions in a pop/rock corpus and examine their usage, thereby deepening
    our understanding of the genre’s harmonic syntax.</p>
    <p>This paper examines the McGill <i>Billboard</i> corpus (Burgoyne et al.
    2011), which consists of harmonic annotations for 740 songs selected from the
    <i>Billboard</i> “Hot 100” (1958–91). This study spotlights the nine
    least-common progressions between consonant triads, many of which have
    received considerable treatment in recent scholarship, such as the Tarnhelm
    and hexatonic-pole progression, and yet collectively represent only 0.67% of
    the consonant progressions in the corpus. Contributing to studies of text
    painting in concert, film, and popular music (Cohn 2004; Murphy 2014; Forrest
    2017; Heine 2018), our analyses reveal uncanny, extra-musical associations
    with these nine progressions. The results suggest that the power of these
    progressions for suggesting “the other” lies more in their relative rarity in
    the syntax than in their voice-leading or tonal function. Furthermore, by
    combining distant- and close-reading methodologies, this paper also reveals
    less obvious usage of these progressions for chromatic embellishment and for
    articulating formal divisions.</p>
