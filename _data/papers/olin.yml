abstract: |
  <p>Édouard Lalo’s opera <i>Le Roi d’Ys</i>, originally subtitled “Legend of
  the Breton Wars of the Fifth Century,” is one of the earliest manifestations
  of musical regionalism to achieve success on a major Parisian stage. Set in
  medieval Brittany, the opera incorporates plainchant-style melodic
  constructions, Breton folk melodies of unnamed provenance or chronological
  specificity, and direct musical references to the emerging political movement
  of regionalism. Regionalist voices, which had first come together
  mid-nineteenth century in Provence, found resonance in other perceived
  cultural outposts of France, especially in Brittany. Viewed by some as a
  threat to Parisian hegemony, these voices were labelled as dangerous
  separatists. Although <i>Le Roi d’Ys</i> was begun sometime before December
  1875, it did not achieve a staged production until May 1888, quite likely
  because its libretto alluded to political controversy and was considered too
  provocative. </p>
  <p>This paper examines <i>Le Roi d’Ys</i> as an illustration of the shifting
  musical systems in France during the transitional years between the Second
  Empire and the firm establishment of the Third Republic. With this opera, Lalo
  developed a ground-breaking form of regional medievalism alluding to the
  time-honored cultural heritage based in the antiquity of <i>la petite
  patrie</i> which, at the same time, provided resistance to a centralized,
  Parisian determination of high culture in France. The paper will begin by
  outlining the Breton sources of Lalo’s opera then will trace the influence of
  other innovative composers, especially Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray, who
  was also interested in both ancient music and the music of regional France. I
  will argue that Lalo’s prominent use of the <i>noël</i>, the genre most
  esteemed by regionalists as a living link between medieval poet-musicians and
  “modern troubadours,” was both deliberate and audacious. Its celebration of
  <i>la couleur locale</i> far exceeding that of any earlier work, Lalo’s opera
  transformed French dramatic music and provided the double impetus to pull away
  from Parisian dictates on high culture and bring to Paris the ancient voices
  of <i>la France profonde</i>.</p>
