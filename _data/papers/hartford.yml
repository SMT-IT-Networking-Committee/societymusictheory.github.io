abstract: |
  <p>In 1934, dancer Serge Lifar toured Rio de Janeiro and premiered a ballet,
  <i>Jurupary</i>, set to Villa-Lobos’s <i>Choros no. 10</i> (1926).
  Choreographed by Lifar himself, the work’s scenario, jointly written by Lifar
  and Victor de Carvalho, was loosely based on Amerindian mythology. Brazilian
  critics were ecstatic: one gushed that “Neither Prokofiev, nor Poulenc, nor
  Auric has given a more significant thing.” Another lauded Lifar’s
  interpretation as one that “entered definitively in the repertory of genius in
  dance,” imagining the work’s place along the classics of modern ballet, drawing
  parallels to Ravel’s <i>Daphnis et Chloé</i> and Stravinsky’s <i>Petrouchka</i>
  and <i>L’oiseau de feu</i>.</p>
  <p>While <i>Choros no. 10</i> remains a well-known work, the ballet has been
  nearly forgotten. Yet archival sources for the production, and primary sources
  documenting its reception, tell a complicated story about the ways national
  identity intertwined with transnational rhetoric, reflecting the particular
  power of French approval in shaping Brazilian self-representation. Carol A.
  Hess has recently called for greater attention to the Villa-Lobos’s
  “universalist” work in the 1930s, and particularly the <i>Bachianas
  Brasileiras</i>, but <i>Jurupary</i> and the program on which it appeared
  demonstrate that exoticist self-representations focusing on politically and
  culturally marginalized populations within Brazil continued to win accolades
  from Brazilian critics in the mid-1930s. <i>Jurupary</i> was the culmination of
  a program featuring two other ballets on Amerindian themes, Villa-Lobos’s own
  <i>Amazonas</i> and Lorenzo Fernández’s <i>Imbapára</i>. While the published
  synopsis of <i>Jurupary</i> emphasizes the work’s Amerindian roots, photos of
  the costumes problematize the work’s scant claims to Amerindian authenticity.
  For the 1936 Paris premiere, ballerina Suria Magito wore heavy necklaces, a
  fitted top, and a fruit basket headdress, a costume that presaged Carmen
  Miranda’s Hollywood persona and drew inspiration from the same figure: an
  Afro-Brazilian <i>baiana</i>, a woman from Bahia, the state imagined as the
  most culturally African in Brazil. The primary sources thus reveal fissures in
  the very narratives the work told. As this paper demonstrates, both the shape
  the ballet took and its success in Rio were tied to debates about Brazilian
  identity, art, and the nation’s role in a broader cultural milieu imagined as
  “universal.” </p>
