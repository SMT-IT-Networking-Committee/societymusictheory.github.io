  <p>While several recent analyses dissect the film and television portrayal of
  women in math and science fields (Steinke 2005, D’Amore 2014), their critiques
  omit the score’s role in shaping representation. Bucking the perception that
  women are less capable in technical fields (see the Google Manifesto; Nosek,
  Banaji, & Greenwald 2002; Elmore and Luna-Lucero 2016), <i>Hidden Figures</i>,
  <i>Interstellar</i>, <i>The Imitation Game</i>, <i>Proof</i>, and <i>Peg +
  Cat</i>’s “The Einstein Problem” present female STEM role models: brilliant
  women who serve not solely as love objects, but whose mathematical acumen
  proves integral to the plot. Likewise, their music over images of women’s
  cognition eschews what Fülöp terms the “feminine Romantic cliché” (2012).
  Instead, these films deploy minimalist cues, which—contrary to Gorbman’s
  assessment of music as “signifier of emotion”—are culturally encoded as
  signifiers of rational genius (Lehman 2013, Eaton 2014).</p>
  <p>But while these characters’ musical representation escapes the gendered
  stereotype of a love theme, a closer examination of these scores reveals
  differing depictions of male and female genius. Drawing upon Eaton’s
  characteristics of the mathematician musical topic (2016), this paper
  describes three ways STEM females undergo disparate musical treatment, with
  alterations that may complicate the films’ purportedly progressive ideologies.
  First, although the “math genius” topic accompanies other characters in the
  film, her cognition may not be associated with it. This lacuna possibly
  implies lesser intellect. Second, the woman might never be associated alone
  with the topic, but alongside men; this suggests her math is derivative or
  that its authorship is suspect. Third, the genius topic’s musical
  characteristics (as defined by Eaton) can be altered, either through lighter
  texture, swapping its customary orchestration for traditionally gender-linked
  ones such as women’s choir, or transforming from minimalism toward an emotive,
  Romantic style. So despite these films’ intent to recuperate the place of
  women in STEM, their scoring undercuts their message, discriminating against
  women despite their scripts’ evisceration of discrimination. These hidden
  musical figures cast doubt, undermining the visual proof of these women’s
  beautiful minds.</p>
