  <p>Since early times, Chinese musical thought emphasized how harmonious notes
  in ritual music were associated with harmonious relations in the social
  sphere. When Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) music officials attempted to
  restore ancient musical practices, in addition to consulting the descriptions
  and diagrams from transmitted sources, they also used the metaphors in music
  theory terminology as a kind of evidence. For instance, in a long-held
  correlation, the five notes of the pentatonic scale were said to represent the
  ruler, minister, people, affairs, and things. Some theorists argued that scale
  arrangements on the single-octave chimes in which the notes corresponding to
  the minister or the people were lower, and thus more fundamental, than that of
  the ruler constituted breaches of the respect due one’s seniors; the two
  higher notes, by contrast, presented no problem, since they argued only humans
  could be the object of the ruler’s reverence. This division also neatly fit
  music theory, since in terms of scale generation, the notes representing
  humans were <i>yang</i> notes while the others were <i>yin</i>. Some reformers
  suggested the addition of four upper-octave notes to the chimes for use in
  these problematic scales, giving a total of sixteen; others found this
  numerologically inappropriate and adopted other interpretations. The
  underlying political metaphor was a pressing issue in the political context of
  the mid-eleventh century; in the aftermath of the charges of factionalism
  during the Qingli reforms, it became crucial to establish the ultimate
  authority of the emperor over ministers, in both political and musical space.
