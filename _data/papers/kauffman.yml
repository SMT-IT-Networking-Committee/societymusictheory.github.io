abstract: |
  <p>A significant musical genre in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France,
  the <i>cantique spirituel</i> in its simplest form is a religious text in
  French set to a borrowed or newly composed melody. Such simple, didactic
  <i>cantiques</i> were often published as texts to be sung to well-known tunes,
  and were used by Catholic religious orders for the education of the faithful
  in the catechism and the reconversion of Protestants to the true church. </p>
  <p>An unusual set of twenty-three <i>cantiques spirituels</i>, titled
  “Pseaumes de Mr de Noailles,” is found in several manuscripts from the Maison
  royale de Saint-Louis at Saint-Cyr; the <i>cantiques</i> depart in both style
  and intended use from typical didactic <i>cantiques</i>. Eleven of the
  “Pseaumes” include headings that show they were to be sung during the Little
  Hours of the Divine Office—a far cry from their typical use. Moreover,
  thirteen of the “Pseaumes” are composed as <i>plain-chant musical</i>, a style
  of monophonic music used during the seventeenth century for new compositions
  in the Catholic liturgy, featuring melodies that resemble traditional
  Gregorian chant. </p>
  <p>The set’s title reveals connections to the court of Louis XIV: “Mr de
  Noailles” is most likely Anne-Jules duc de Noailles, who commissioned a set of
  psalm paraphrases from poet Jean-Baptiste Rousseau in 1699; five of the
  “Noailles” texts can be identified as by Rousseau. Although the cantique
  melodies remain anonymous, Anne-Jules’s son, Adrien-Maurice duc d’Ayen, may
  have had a hand in them. The duc—who married the niece of Madame de Maintenon
  in 1698—is reported to have composed a motet that was sung for Madame de
  Maintenon in 1700. Still, the duc d’Ayen is unlikely to have written the
  <i>plain-chant musical</i> melodies, since that type of music typically lay
  within the purview of church musicians. A likely candidate for them is
  Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, who was well known for his <i>plain-chant
  musical</i> works and served as maître de musique at Saint-Cyr, where the
  community observed the Little Hours. In any case, these modest works reflect
  connections among powerful court figures: the Noailles family and Mme de
  Maintenon, founder of the convent school at Saint-Cyr and the king’s wife.
