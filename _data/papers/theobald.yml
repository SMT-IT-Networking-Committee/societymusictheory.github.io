abstract: |
  <p>Premiered under the crosses of the Shipyard Workers Monument at Gdańsk’s
  Lenin Shipyard on 16 December 1980, Krzysztof Penderecki’s <i>Lacrimosa</i>
  functions as a memorial to the lives lost in the 1970 crisis, an event that
  galvanized the Solidarity movement. Penderecki used the final stanzas of the
  <i>Dies irae</i>, which in combination with Czesław Miłosz’s poem “You Who
  Wronged” and a Bible verse engraved on the monument, articulates a subliminal,
  if not subversive, message: Indicting the aggressors in the 1970 murders and
  searching for reconciliation. Indeed, Penderecki’s treatment of the sacred
  text, particularly the relationship between the soloist and the chorus,
  represents both the oppressors and those working toward compromise,
  functioning in fact as an allegory of Solidarity’s objectives. </p>
  <p>As I argue in this paper, Penderecki’s textual choices and careful text
  setting in <i>Lacrimosa</i> follow a hermeneutical path, where the
  commemoration of a tragic event is re-imagined as a reflection of Poland’s
  contemporary politics. Using Paul Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of history, I suggest
  that Penderecki’s music, combined with inscriptions of excerpts of Miłosz’s
  poetry on the monument, offered indexical elements from the Catholic requiem
  mass that resonated with the people of Poland. </p>
  <p>Although the chorus has been understood as mere accompaniment for the
  soprano soloist (Schwinger, 1989 and Chłopicka, 2003/2006), I argue that the
  differing roles of the soloist and the chorus, especially on the words
  “<i>judicandus homo reus</i>” (the guilty to be judged) for example, create a
  dialogic between the Polish people and the aggressors, which can be understood
  in a number of ways. These allegories allowed Penderecki to circumvent
  censorship while highlighting the dualism of the monument’s historical
  significance and contemporary resonance. In a subtle act of re-presenting
  history through a sacred text in light of Solidarity, Penderecki not only
  encourages listeners to not forget “[those] who wronged,” but also completes
  Ricoeur’s mimetic arc with both historical reflection and musical language.
  With this work, Penderecki begins a long journey of composing his <i>Polish
  Requiem</i> (1980–2005), reinterpreting musically pivotal events in Poland’s
  recent history and encouraging listeners to remember and relive the past.</p>
