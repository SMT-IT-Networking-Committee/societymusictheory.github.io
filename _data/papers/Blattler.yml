abstract: | 
    <p>This poster presents analyses of Maurice Ravel’s sonata-form movements in which the first theme is not recapitulated in stable tonic harmony, appearing instead in a different key or over a dominant pedal. This uncouples the components of the “double return” characteristic of most recapitulations, deferring tonic return until the second-theme reprise or, in four cases, the second theme’s final cadence. This recapitulatory strategy eliminates the “redundancy” of having the global tonic return at both the first- and second-theme reprises, and Ravel often combines it with processes in other musical domains that emphasize the deferred tonic return’s status as a singular event.</p>
    <p>Ravel deploys this generically unconventional strategy more often than he does the standard double-return template. Recognizing this predilection can nuance conceptions of his formal practice as quasi-spatial (Puri 2012; Fillerup 2013) or as the pouring of content into adopted models (Orenstein 1975; Rosen 1979), spotlighting a teleological component to these forms that buttresses an understanding of Ravel’s forms as the intersection of multiple compositional processes/challenges (Kaminsky 2012, following Jankélévitch 1959) and fleshing-out our conception of the range of 20<sup>th</sup>-century treatments of compositional inheritances.</p>
