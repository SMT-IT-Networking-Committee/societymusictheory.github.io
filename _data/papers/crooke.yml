    <p>While hip-hop plays an increasingly centralized role in global youth
    culture, there remains a significant gap in music therapy literature and
    practice regarding hip-hop music. There are important exceptions to this gap,
    including Hadley and Yancy’s “Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop,” which
    explain connections to therapeutic themes. Yet detailed understandings and
    practical guides detailing how to integrate sampling and beat making into
    therapy sessions remain absent from textbooks and training courses. This
    session will present and discuss several applied models for using beat making
    in music therapy developed from recent Australian research designed to address
    this gap.</p>
