  <p>In 1604, French royal printers issued the <i>Airs et Villanelles Fran.
  Ital. Espa. Suice. et Turcq</i> of Charles Tessier, which ends with two
  “<i>Chansons Turcquesques</i>.” Scholars have dismissed the Turkish songs as
  nonsensical parodies, probably leftovers from Turkish scenes in court ballets
  (Durosoir, 1991, Dobbins 2006, Vaisse 2006). Most assessments Orientalize them
  as “exotic,” “<i>turquerie</i>” (analogous to <i>chinoiserie</i>), and
  “pseudo-Turkish gobbledygook,” and align them with later strains of French
  cultural imperialism. My paper critiques these Orientalist interpretations,
  arguing that scholars have misread the <i>chansons turquesques</i> at every
  level: historical, literary, and musical.</p>
  <p>In the first place, France was not a geopolitical power but a supplicant in
  1604, when Henry IV sought crucial trade capitulations from Sultan Ahmed I.
  Tessier’s chansons likely commemorate the granting of these much-publicized
  concessions, which protected French ships from corsairs who seized goods and
  enslaved French sailors.</p>
  <p>Secondly, the lyrics of the <i>chansons turquesques</i> are fully
  intelligible: the language is a spoken form of Ottoman Turkish, written with
  Francophone orthography. This filtering of Turkish speech through French
  transcription evinces face-to-face transmission, encouraging new research into
  Franco-Ottoman exchange. My findings at the <i>Archives diplomatiques</i>
  reveal considerable mobility of diplomats, merchants, and travelers between
  France and the Sublime Porte. Evidence of musical interchange includes a
  “petit Turc” who taught the dauphin a Turkish song in 1604 (Robinson,
  2015).</p>
  <p>Finally, my musical analyses bring Ottoman rhythmic cycles (usul) and modes
  (makam) into play. One song, which Dobbins describes as having “strange mode
  and cadences,” actually employs an ordinary <i>folia</i> chord progression.
  But the other has a makam-like melody, still traceable despite Tessier’s
  elimination of its enharmonic scale degrees in his four-voice harmonization.
  Stripped of affect, the result exemplifies Nicola Vicentino’s indictment of
  Western diatonicism (1555): “with the music in use nowadays it is impossible
  to write . . . Turkish or Hebrew songs.” Read cross-culturally, polyphonic
  chansons emerge as impoverished and staff notation inadequate, subjects
  returned to by Ali Ufki (1666), my last example.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, Tessier’s <i>chansons turquesques</i> invite fresh
  considerations of cultural mobility across the Mediterranean, opening our ears
  to oral transmission, enharmonicism, and multi-ethnic musical environments
  c.1600.</p>
