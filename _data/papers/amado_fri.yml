  <p>While Latin American music research often engages repertoires from the
  colonial era and the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, relatively little
  has been published on the nineteenth century. I have suggested elsewhere that
  several factors contribute to this historiographical oversight, including
  nineteenth-century conceptions of “music as art,” a colonialist worldview that
  characterize non-European music as merely imitating European trends,
  historical conditions that transformed musical institutions and patronage
  systems in the region, and exoticist and nationalist biases in musicological
  research during much of the twentieth century. These challenges
  notwithstanding, the nineteenth century saw important developments that help
  explain the trajectories of musical genres and styles in Latin America and
  their dialogic relationship with European musical traditions.</p>
  <p>In this paper I analyze the funerary responsory for choir and orchestra
  <i>Libera Me</i> by Guatemalan composer Benedicto Sáenz (Sr? 1780–1831), a
  piece that remains obscure for the reasons outlined above. As a liturgical
  piece, it transgresses conceptions of music as “art” and offends Liberal
  sensibilities of secularism and Enlightenment. It fails to include “exotic”
  indigenous or African idioms, eschewing a musical blend that would make it
  distinctly Guatemalan or Latin American—thus undermining nationalist agendas
  and the search for an exotic musical Other. It even shows part-writing
  unorthodoxies that invite characterizations of the piece as second-rate when
  compared to canonical works from Europe. Nevertheless, the piece displays
  remarkable motivic unity, a thoughtful incorporation of late eighteenth- and
  early nineteenth-century topics, intense chromaticism characteristic of
  emerging Romantic sensibilities, and harmonic parallelisms that deliberately
  break away from common-practice rules and could well be interpreted as
  stylistically innovative. Sáenz’s <i>Libera Me</i> therefore challenges us to
  critically consider nineteenth-century Latin American music. This new and
  expanded analysis of the piece’s form, function, instrumentation, topics,
  harmony, and part-writing suggests that this repertoire can offer insights
  into the epistemological orientation of music research in Latin America, the
  transnational connections between the music of Latin America and Europe, local
  adaptations and innovations of European music, and thus enrich our knowledge
  of nineteenth-century music and history.</p>
