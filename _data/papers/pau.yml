abstract: |
  <p>Debussy’s <i>Six épigraphes antiques</i> for piano four hands (1914) is a
  work that has been relatively neglected in the analytical literature. The
  Épigraphes are an expansion and reworking of Debussy’s unpublished incidental
  music to <i>Chansons de Bilitis</i> (1901): 100 measures from 1901 were
  expanded to 273 measures in 1914. The background to the work’s genesis
  presented Debussy with an interesting compositional challenge: how to fuse
  pre-existing material with newly composed material into a seamless whole. An
  exploration of the decisions that Debussy made in response to this challenge
  can provide a unique window into his compositional practice.</p>
  <p>This paper compares the Épigraphes to their (unacknowledged) source
  material, focusing on Debussy’s composition of connecting, contrasting, and
  concluding sections in 1914 using pre-existing motivic and rhythmic material
  from 1901. Because the newly composed sections of the first four Épigraphes
  replaced the recitation of selected Bilitis poems by Pierre Louÿs in the 1901
  work, the paper also connects these newly composed passages to the imagery of
  the poems that they replaced.</p>
  <p>My study of the Épigraphes suggests that Debussy privileged the use of
  motivic cells (one might even say <i>Grundgestalten</i>) as unifying devices
  in his mature compositions. And yet, only eight months before the work’s
  completion, Debussy had issued a plea that composers “not stifle all feeling
  underneath a mass of superimposed designs and motives.” In analyzing the
  nature of Debussy’s (re)compositional process in the Épigraphes, we stand to
  gain a more nuanced and complete insight into his compositional practice and
  musical aesthetics.</p>
