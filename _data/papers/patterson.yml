    <p>The texture of Schubert’s “Der Doppelgänger” is simplistic, yet its
    desolate landscape continues to draw the attention of musical analysts. One
    striking feature is the modulation from the B-minor tonic to D-sharp minor in
    mm. 47–50. Most Schenkerian analyses reconcile the significance of this
    passage as a third-divider or remove it completely from the middleground
    voice-leading. On the other hand, I offer a reading that places D-sharp minor
    at the center of the song’s structure and narrative meaning.</p>
    <p>For this analysis, I am employing a new methodology inspired by
    transformation models and Robert Bailey’s double-tonic complex: the
    multidimensional musical object (MMO). A MMO allows the analyst to expand the
    traditional tonic from a single triad into a nexus of interconnected triads a
    major third apart. These additional tonal dimensions help to clarify the
    complicated harmonic language of 19th-century composers by incorporating more
    chords within a single function—or a single <i>Stufe</i> for Schenkerian
    analysis. In Schubert’s “Der Doppelgänger,” the tonic function encompasses B
    minor and D-sharp minor. This interpretation is supported by Schubert’s
    setting of the text, in which D-sharp minor is used to represent the
    Doppelgänger—a different version of the poem’s protagonist. The Doppelgänger
    is a manifestation of the past and the trauma that is associated with those
    events.</p>
