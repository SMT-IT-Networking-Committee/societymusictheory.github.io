  <p>In this presentation I examine statements about music theory on Twitter,
  with special interest in the prevalence of complaints. I interpret these
  often-humorous expressions of angst as real-time emotional responses to
  encounters with music theory, and a significant source of insight into how
  music theory is viewed. This presentation extends my work as the operator of
  the Twitter account <a href="//twitter.com/darkmusictheory">@darkmusictheory</a>,
  where I have been cataloguing complaints about music theory since 2014.</p>
  <p>I see @darkmusictheory participating in what I call “digital public music
  theory.” Public music theory and public musicology are gaining traction, but
  their practices remain ambiguously defined and controversially practiced. In
  reflecting on challenges associated with public music scholarship, other
  scholars have noted a failure to identify what public(s) we aim to reach, as
  well as the fact that traditional modes of public music scholarship have
  tended to target a “public” that is largely white, urban, and middle- to
  upper-class. Rather than bringing academic views of music theory to an
  ill-defined public, my project explores how music theory is defined,
  discussed, and put to use by Twitter’s diverse digital publics. How music
  theory appears in the public sphere is an important aspect of what music
  theory is, and therefore of great value to professional music theorists. I
  argue that information gathered from digital publics like Twitter can help
  professional music theorists better understand the meanings of music theory,
  and, consequently, to re-articulate our goals as scholars and teachers.</p>
