    <p>In this presentation I examine Victorian evolutionary theorist Herbert
    Spencer’s famous injunction, “All music is originally vocal.” In <i>The
    Origin and Function of Music</i> (1857), Spencer tracked a “progressive”
    line of ascent from simple vocal exclamations, to complex speech, and
    finally to music. Charles Darwin claimed oppositely that music evolved
    into language. Spencer’s vision of musical progress tracks with his
    conception of a dynamic capacity for emotional expression that is specific
    to the human species. The Spencerian idea that sonic expressivity evolved
    teleologically from simplicity to complexity, and from homogeneousness to
    heterogeneousness, reflects Spencer’s more general theory of evolutionary
    progress and anticipates modernist aesthetic ideologies.</p>
    <p>My interest in Spencer’s music theory is less cosmological and more
    ethical. I probe what constitutes musical personhood for Spencer, as well
    as the kinds of sociocultural realities that can be formulated on the
    basis of theories like his. Voice is key here; for Spencer, voice is the
    fulcrum of language and music, exemplifying a broader physiological link
    between emotion and muscular movement. I highlight his sense that words
    evolved from vocal imitations of the phenomenal world, and I locate
    Spencer within a historical mimological tradition, alongside thinkers like
    Plato, Leibniz, John Locke, and Max Müller. “Mimologics” is Gérard
    Genette’s term for ideas about language that invoke a mimetic origin or
    function; I introduce Genette’s ideas for a music theory audience.
    Finally, I bring Spencer’s conception of an unmediated link between voice
    and emotional expression into contact with contemporary evolutionary
    musicology in order to assess the mimologics latent within present-day
    evolutionary music theories.</p>
