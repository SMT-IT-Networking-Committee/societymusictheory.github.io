    <p>In this paper, I compare Charles Darwin’s evolutionary music theory and
    Herbert Spencer’s lesser-known (and often mischaracterized) ideas in order
    to explore the implications of combining music theory and evolutionary
    theory. In 1857, two years before the publication of Darwin’s <i>Origin of
    Species</i>, the philosopher and biologist Herbert Spencer published “The
    Origin and Function of Music” in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>. Darwin’s own
    perspective on the evolutionary origins of music did not appear until
    <i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871), where he placed the origins of music in
    the spontaneous formation of rhythms and cadences in animal courtship
    rituals, corresponding to the pre-linguistic phase of human evolution. By
    contrast, Spencer proposed a theory of origins where music represents a
    specifically human stage of evolutionary advance, beyond linguistic
    acquisition. Where Darwin understands music as an unconscious
    proto-language that emerges alongside the instinctual urge for domination
    and sexual reproduction, Spencer describes the biological activity of
    music as an advanced province of the human species, which alone possesses
    the emotional “force” and “variation” necessary for musical expression.
    For Spencer, what is primal is not sexuality but rather the unique
    receptivity of a musical body to emotions, both pleasurable and painful.
    In sharpening the distinctions of this evolutionist debate, I show that
    both Darwin and Spencer invoke music to delineate a human-animal boundary,
    such that the formal features of music become entwined with the limits and
    potentials of the human species.</p>
