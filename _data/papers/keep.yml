  <p>The Andante from Brahms’s Second Piano Concerto opens with a lavish theme
  played by a solo cello, but over the course of the B-flat major ternary form
  the solo piano gradually loses its ability to articulate this theme.
  Throughout the A and B sections, the piano plays only increasingly
  less-recognizable fragments of the theme, and just at the moment of the main
  theme’s expected return, Brahms instead interpolates references to two of his
  lieder (“Lerchengesang,” op. 70, no. 2 and “Todessehnen,” op. 86, no. 6). With
  the slower tempo and remote key of F-sharp major, the song quotations in op.
  83 hijack the Andante’s form at the moment of greatest anticipation. This
  demands explanation, and the use of texted music suggests that poetic content
  plays a significant role in shaping the movement. Taken together, the
  fragmented motivic treatment of the main theme in the piano, the distinctively
  liminal formal devices found throughout, and the temporal stretching of
  passages with slower tempi embody a psychological struggle to access past
  memory. From a broader perspective, this analysis suggests that Brahms’s
  practice of quotation is not just an intriguing use of shared melodic
  material; rather, it is a pivotal nexus between texted and non-texted modes of
  musical expression that can offer explanations for unusual compositional
  features.</p>
