    <p>This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of
    Schoenberg’s <i>Fundamentals of Musical Composition</i>, a book in which
    the technique of liquidation is first elucidated. Alexander Goehr, in one
    of the earliest reviews, celebrated the concept while decrying the term
    itself, seemingly because of its association with the Second World War.
    Schoenberg’s appropriation, however, reaches back to the First World War,
    when contemporary accounts of the financial crisis referred to liquidation
    [<i>liquidieren</i>, <i>Liquidation</i>] and to businesses being dissolved
    [<i>aufgelöst</i>].</p>

    <p>As a musical term, liquidation is idiosyncratic. Probing its history
    enables us to capture the resonances that it had for Schoenberg and, in so
    doing, to refine our current usage. This philological investigation entails
    examining a host of related terms, charting their use over time. In his German
    writings, we observe differences in the two editions of the <i>Harmonielehre
    </i>as well as an expansion in meaning as <i>Auflösung </i>depicts dissolution
    as well as resolution. His English writings provide further details: in the
    drafts for <i>Fundamentals</i>, he describes the process where “characteristic
    features” are “annihilated/disintegrated” and “transformed into
    insignificance,” and where “obligatory” forms become “non-obligatory.” Through
    his library, we gain access to the meaning of these descriptors and come
    closer to understanding the “obligations” of the motive. Reading Schoenberg’s
    texts in their original form allows for a clearer and richer understanding of
    liquidation and provides a much-needed framework for differentiating formal
    components such as “shape” [<i>Gestalt</i>], “figure” [<i>Figur</i>], and
    “motive” [<i>Motiv</i>].</p>
