abstract: |
  <p>It is not surprising that Schoenberg, an avid painter, would reflect on the
  similarities and differences between aural and visual art and how they
  determine our experience of the work: “In order for a musical idea to make an
  impression [<i>Eindruck</i>], to be comprehended (it goes past and does not,
  like in painting, stand steadily in front of the eye), it must be (often)
  repeated” (1917). His writings abound with references to the visible and the
  audible, to what can be discerned by the eye and the ear, inviting us to
  investigate their interrelationship. What can we learn from his conception of
  visual and aural “images” [<i>Bilder</i>], “impressions,” “pictures,” and
  “auditory imagery”? What does his language tell us about his perception, what
  he was seeing and hearing in the music he analyzed?</p>
  <p>This paper will draw on a range of sources in German and in English, paying
  particular attention to Schoenberg’s own translations. Referring to the
  dictionaries in his library, I undertake a philological investigation focusing
  on the term “impression.” Taken from the first page of the first draft of
  <i>Fundamentals of Musical Composition</i> (1937), the expression “an
  intelligent and intelligible impression” is Schoenberg’s translation of
  <i>Eindruck</i>—something that is “impressed” on the viewer or the listener
  and that can be deemed “impressive.” Here and in related discussions of form,
  he examines the nature of that impression using terms such as <i>einprägen</i>
  (to impress, imprint, or become fixed in one’s memory, according to his
  dictionary) and <i>merken</i> (an action he rendered in terms of retaining or
  remembering rather than noting or noticing). Memory, “the ability to retain an
  impression [<i>Eindruck</i>]” (1934), is central to the experience of the
  musical work and to the analytical act—to our capacity to grasp
  [<i>fassen</i>] the various noteworthy features [<i>Merkmale</i>].
  Reconstructing this mode of engagement revivifies such overused terms as
  “understanding” [<i>Verstehen</i>], “understandability” (or “intelligibility”)
  [<i>Verständlichkeit</i>], and “comprehensibility” [<i>Fasslichkeit</i>], and
  reinstates cognition to its rightful place at the heart of Schoenberg’s
  thinking.</p>
