    <p>With a career spanning five decades, Joni Mitchell is one of the most prolific and influential singer-songwriters of our time. Mitchell attributes her unique style and sound in large measure to the use of alternate guitar tunings (AGTs)—over 50 AGTs are found in her 107 guitar-based songs. While recent scholarship by Rockwell (2009), Koozin (2011) and De Souza (2018) has made strides in deploying Neo-Riemannian and Lewinian transformational theory in the “enactive landscape” (De Souza, 2018) of the physical fretboard, a similarly thorough application of such constructs regarding AGTs has yet to be undertaken. Mitchell’s music provides a rich canvas to analyze performer-instrument interactions which highlight the degree of physical <em>affordances</em> of the “fret-hand” on the fretboard and the direct musical relationships such affordances provide: the concordance of guitar tunings, physical fret/string-space, musical space, and their synthesis into an enactive <em>physio-musical soundscape</em>. Of equal significance is how Mitchell articulates formal sections of songs through slight adjustments of left-hand position, creating a smooth system of affordances and emergent chord-shape families that readily demarcate formal boundaries.</p>
    <p>Building on work of the above scholars, our tripartite approach to Mitchell’s physio-musical soundscape entails (1) a corpus analysis examining relationships between like tunings and chord shapes, (2) musical analysis engaging both physical fret/string-space and musical space, and (3) the incorporation of these findings into structural and hermeneutic analyses.</p>
