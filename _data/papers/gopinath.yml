    <p>This talk reflects upon my experiences of being told that I was "not a real music theorist" or "not doing music theory." These experiences date back to the earliest days of my involvement in the field as an undergraduate student, through my graduate school years, and even, mostly implicitly, in relation to being hired, the tenure process, and subsequent work at my current institution of employment. While my identity as a South Asian American and person of color in an overwhelmingly white field is not separable from this history, its primary lineaments are intellectual and stem from 1) the experience of research science as an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, and simultaneously being confronted by what appeared to be the pseudo-scientific aspects of modern English-language music theory; 2) my encounters with the broader humanities, critical theory, Marxism, and labor and political organizing while in graduate school, which led to the formation of a scholarly ideal that diverged from the then-prevalent norms in music theory; and 3) the subordination of music-theoretical claims and inquiries to hermeneutic, historical, and political-economic ones in most of my work. My affiliation to music theory is strongest with what Fred Maus has described to me as the "fringe culture of the SMT": a capacious margin that includes a (for some) bewildering diversity of post-paradigmatic scholarly approaches to the study of music. Increasingly, that post-paradigmatic fringe is threatening to swallow up the whole of the field—a tendency that, in my view, we ought to explicitly embrace.</p>

    <p>Stefan Sunandan Honisch (University of British Columbia)</p>
    <p>In counterpoint to the question of whose voices are included and excluded in music academia, my paper asks a question of its own: how have changing aesthetics and shifting critical postures brought new points of emphasis to the creative practices of disabled musicians during Covid-19? Building on the premise that <em>extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures</em>, I explore the ways in which “disability music,” made and received within the curricular and pedagogical systems of “ability music” that our time of pandemic has revealed with particular clarity, throws hierarchical organizations of pitch, rhythm, phrase, melody, harmony, and ultimately, the very idea of “form” itself into crisis. My approach attends to what it means, and, crucially, what it <em>could</em> mean to be disabled at the beginning of a decade that, in Arundhati Roy’s apt words, constitutes a “portal,” inviting our presence “with little luggage, ready to imagine another world” (Roy, 2020). In so many ways, however, now more than a year after Roy’s call, the crisis continues, the portal remains untraversed, another world is left unimagined. Moving within the framework of Critical Disability Studies, and voicing the principles of Disability Justice in response to the epistemic <em>in</em>justices that reduce disability music to music’s other, can, I suggest, help us move beyond the ableist frames of a post-pandemic “return to normal,” a discourse which poses an always unanswered question: normal for whom?</p>
