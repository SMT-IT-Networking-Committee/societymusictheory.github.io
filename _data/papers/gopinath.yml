title: "A Perspective from the Academic Labor Movement"
abstract: |
    <p>I will discuss the power and strategic necessity of solidarity to: (1) countering the for-profit business turn in higher education, and (2) enabling academic workers to rise to meet the challenges of a transforming society. It is solidarity between academic workers like contingent and tenure-line faculty; between students and faculty; among fast food workers, faculty, and students, that can truly turn the tide, as has been demonstrated in SEIU’s Fight for 15 campaign, the Chicago Teachers Union progressively more powerful and groundbreaking strikes, and the great industrial unions of the CIO.</p>
