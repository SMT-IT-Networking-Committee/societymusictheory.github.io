  <p>Music’s sexual and sexualizing qualities typically remain bracketed out
  from musical analysis, because, supposedly, unlike formal elements like
  frequency, amplitude, spectrum, or spectromorphology, sexuality espouses
  considerations beyond what one can conclude from sound alone. Whereas, over
  the last thirty years, setting off sexuality in this way<i> </i>has been
  framed as a type of exclusion, brackets can be useful: sexuality—seemingly
  absent from spectrograms and musical scores—requires nuanced and specialized
  study within musical contexts. </p>
  <p>Because electroacoustic music often plays with sound’s relation to its
  originating circumstances, it is particularly suited to capturing and
  expressing sexual topics. Electroacoustic music deemphasizes the performer’s
  physical presence without relinquishing human inference entirely, allowing
  eroticism to depart from its insistence on the body while leaving room in
  electroacoustic theory for inquiry into music’s inherent themes of identity
  (and) politics. </p>
  <p>Even when composers articulate their intentions of composing an erotic
  electroacoustic work, analyses following composers’ motivations do not rely
  simply on conjecture about the music’s program; rather, sexually connotative
  elements can be determined through analysis of the music’s very sounds. To
  show how sexual inference is woven into the tapestry of “electrosexual”
  musical works, I focus on three parameters: convention (common musical or
  sonic idioms), mimesis (imitation, allusion), and form (sonic envelope,
  contour, and texture) to reveal some recurring patterns in the way sex
  commonly sounds in electroacoustic music.</p>
