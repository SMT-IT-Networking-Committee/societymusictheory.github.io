abstract: |
  <p>Dramatic interpretations of the drug war in Latin America has within recent
  years increased in number, particularly with television shows such as the
  Netflix original series <i>Narcos</i> (2015) and Telemundo’s telenovela <i>La
  reina del sur</i> (2011). During this decade, one of the more significant
  cinematic contributions is Luis Estrada’s 2010 film <i>El Infierno</i>, which
  premiered in a sea of controversy during Mexico’s centennial of the 1910
  Revolution and at the height of President Felipe Calderón’s war on drugs. The
  film follows the protagonist Benny as he transitions from a recently deported
  undocumented immigrant to a forced narco-assassin in a fictional town in
  northern Mexico. To amplify this transition, <i>El Infierno</i> features
  primarily narcocorridos and música norteña, which have become requisite aural
  signifiers of not just the narco-border film genre, but also popular
  impressions of narco-traficantes and border culture in general. This music
  reflects Benny’s transformation while also accompanying explicit scenes of
  violence, some examples ripped from the headlines of Mexico’s popular press.
  Together, the music, moving image, and narrative provide a deeply embedded
  cultural association to the violence, with music functioning specifically as a
  desensitization tool as Benny witnesses the cartel’s power spin out of
  control. In this presentation, I analyze two musical sequences that I argue
  emulate Benny’s experiences, first as a deportee then as an assassin,
  reinforcing his transition from one forced identity to another while also
  supplying a darkly satirical yet critical commentary on the harsh realities of
  Mexico’s drug war, still relevant eight years later. </p>
