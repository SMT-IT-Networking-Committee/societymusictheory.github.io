abstract: |
  <p>This paper contends that the very concept of Italian song, that is, how
  vernacular verse was to be performed, was in play before, during, and after
  the appearance of Petrucci’s <i>frottola</i> prints. The diversity and
  experimental nature of cultural practices regarding song are evident in just
  about every important Italian center. What was happening in the north Italian
  courtly orbits of the <i>frottola</i> was only one of those developments, but
  the irresistible hyper-focus this rich body of printed, polyphonic repertory
  has attracted has both skewed and obscured our understanding of Italian song
  during a critical period of change. </p>
  <p>In Florence, for example, where the madrigal (like “frottola,” another
  older term for a specific poetic form that was re-purposed to encompass a
  group of forms) emerged by 1530 as the dominant form of sung vernacular verse,
  the decades between ca. 1480 and 1520 were a rich and messy field of poetic
  genres, venues, and performing practices. This paper will survey that field,
  including printed poetry collections, theatrical productions, academic
  activities, civic performance (carnival, piazza, and civic heralds), and elite
  private venues, with an eye to capturing the differing conceptions of what
  constituted an Italian song. A priority here will be the restoration of oral
  practices, especially the deeply rooted Italian cultural practice of
  <i>cantare ad lyram</i>, to the discussion of Italian song. From such a
  perspective, it is hoped, can emerge a fresh discussion of fundamental shifts
  in the landscape of song regarding the emergence of the madrigal, the ongoing
  role of solo singing, the debates on language, the impact of print and
  “publication,” and transformations of the roles of composer, poet, and
  performer during the gradual adoption of what Pirrotta called “the polyphonic
  <i>maniera</i>.”</p>
