abstract: | 
    <p>In 2010, I presented a paper titled “Looking for an Aural Skills Tutor? Try SmartMusic.” Now as then, interacting with technology to increase skills and knowledge is an integral component of my teaching, whether as preparation for in-class activities, repetition, reinforcement, or assessment. When designing technology-assisted learning activities, the primary questions remain “What can technology do well?” and “What does technology not do well?” </p>
    <p>A primary advantage of engaging technology remains to delete the “fear factor” of performing in class when learners are still acquiring knowledge and skills. After sufficient private practice, “fear factor” can transform into “showmanship.” And when a student still struggles when performing in class, classmates become encouraging teammates who cheer hard-earned success. This is particularly true of aural skills, which due to its abstract and elusive nature, require that students create a unified whole from three discrete entities: sound, notation, and label. Most often, I encounter students who have linked notation and label, or sound and label, but rarely all three, such that they readily sight read, transcribe music, and detect errors in the rendition of a score.  </p>
    <p>While the growing collection of instructional music software programs and apps are effective electronic tutors that detect student errors, the challenge remains that they guide acquiring skills and knowledge that are transferable in new and more difficult contexts, as excellent teachers strive to do.</p>
