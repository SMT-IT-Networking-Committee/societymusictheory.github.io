    <p>This paper presents possibilities for those who wish to decentralize
    chorale writing in particular, and perhaps classical music in general, in
    their own curricula. I report from my own experiences of constructing and
    directing a four-semester curriculum that gives only glancing attention to
    chorale writing and its voice leading rules. Decentralizing chorales in
    the theory classroom is not without its challenges; these include a dearth
    of pedagogical support from textbooks and lack of a unified pedagogical
    framework. I show how I am able to respond to these challenges by
    developing an eclectic, modular curriculum that seeks to be responsive to
    the interests and needs of my students.</p>
    <p>In my curriculum, Theory I acts as a gateway course while the other
    three courses may be taken in any order and rotated out of the sequence
    according to instructor and student interest (the other three classes are
    currently rhythm, counterpoint, and contemporary styles). Rotating out
    classes allows the instructor to respond to the always-changing musical
    lives of students at a given institution and impart skills applicable
    across a wide variety of musical activities, from church arrangements to
    beat-making, popular songwriting, and/or classical music performance and
    composition. I argue that a non-sequential and eclectic approach can
    constitute a first step toward deconstructing the problematic yet
    pervasive teleology of style that informs mainstream music theory pedagogy
    at present. It is one way to keep apace of our rapidly shifting world, and
    to stay relevant to our studentsâ€™ increasingly diverse musical
    experiences.</p>
