    <p>Though patriarchal structures contributed to the neglect of Marion
    Bauer’s music during her lifetime (1882–1955), contemporary scholars have
    begun to recognize its value. Recent book-length examinations assess
    Bauer’s output, but their scope allows only brief consideration of her
    style; conversely, detailed analyses of individual pieces support narrowly
    focused critical readings. I bridge this gap by defining the “chromatic
    wedge,” a gesture Bauer often employs to delineate sections, particularly
    in instrumental music of the 1920s and ’30s. The chromatic wedge combines
    linear chromatic motion comprising at least five pitches with a pedal
    tone, brief ostinato, or second chromatic line in contrary motion. My
    poster will examine its use as a salient marker of formal boundaries
    throughout the Duo for Oboe and Clarinet, op. 25. The Duo makes an
    illuminating case study, as the chromatic wedge unifies the four diverse
    movements. More broadly, when moving away from traditional tonality, Bauer
    might have retained the wedge as a way to retain closing function in the
    absence of fifth relationships. As such, the chromatic wedge became one
    important element uniting Bauer’s varied approaches to musical
    organization.</p>
