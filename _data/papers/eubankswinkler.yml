  <p>What is the relationship between documents (scores, texts) and historically
  informed performance? Performance studies scholar Rebecca Schneider has
  identified a temporal telescoping that occurs when twenty-first-century people
  seek to replay the past, arguing that these performances engage with what
  Gertrude Stein called syncopated time—a space in which past and present are
  thrown together via temporal disruption, where “then and now punctuate each
  other.” When musicologists analyze printed and manuscript materials, what
  theatre historian Tiffany Stern in another context calls the documents of
  performance, we also engage with syncopated time, as present-day eyes interpret
  and imagine traces of past performance. </p>
  <p>In July 2017, I had the opportunity to explore the relationship between the
  archival remains of the past (a 1674 wordbook and period score) and onstage
  action in the present, as I served as musical director and choreographer for a
  staged workshop of Thomas Shadwell’s 1674 operatic revision of Shakespeare’s
  <i>The Tempest</i> at the Wanamaker Theatre, Shakespeare’s Globe. My paper
  focuses on one scene, “The Masque of Devils,” with music composed by Pelham
  Humfrey and Pietro Reggio, which particularly illuminates the tensions among
  historical knowledge, practical realities, and modern expectations. The
  experience of the performers, scholars, and paying members of the public who
  attended the workshop was framed by the Globe brand and its engagement with
  “original practices,” a staging approach that purports to recover an
  “authentic” early modern performance style, something that is no longer an aim
  of most historically informed musicians. The space of the Wanamaker itself and
  the bodies of our singers and actors also shaped our performance in practical
  ways, as we sought to replicate precisely a stage direction from Shadwell’s
  1674 wordbook and experienced aesthetic failure. Finally, I analyze the
  performance archive we created—what was lost and what was preserved when
  participants transformed their theatrical experience into pictures and tweets.
  Our revivification of the Restoration <i>Tempest</i> thus revealed the ways in
  which the present must always punctuate the past, how spaces and bodies shape
  performance, and what our archive—what our documentary remains—occluded and
  revealed.</p>
