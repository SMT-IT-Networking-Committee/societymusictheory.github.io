abstract: |
  <p>In the aftermath of rock ’n’ roll and Beatlemania, popular music became a
  powerful instrument in Cold War contestation. Under American and British
  leadership, the capitalist democracies of the West produced a musical youth
  culture that baby boomers across the world embraced as the soundtrack of their
  life experience. Communist governments denounced rock and pop as subversive
  propaganda, but as the era progressed they struggled to curtail the influence
  of modern popular music in their societies. Proposing that music played a
  crucial role in Cold War cultural competition, historians have highlighted the
  importance of cultural diplomatic efforts like radio broadcasting and concert
  tours in familiarizing Eastern Bloc audiences with Western lifestyles.</p>
  <p>This paper demonstrates that cultural diplomacy was, in fact, flanked by
  large-scale cultural commerce between the music industries of communist
  countries and record companies in the capitalist sphere. It illuminates how
  the state-owned music monopolist of the German Democratic Republic (GDR)
  cooperated with American, British, and West German enterprises to domestically
  produce and distribute popular releases by Western performers in the period
  between the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and the demise of the Warsaw
  Pact in 1989. It contends that the Western-licensed music program, which East
  Germany’s music industry had designed to generate lucrative profits for the
  state and disperse opposition to cultural isolationism, led the country’s
  market into dependency on the capitalist entertainment industry. Based on the
  evaluation of exclusive primary source material such as formerly top secret
  production figures and oral histories by industry insiders, it showcases the
  first empirical analysis of a communist music marketplace. The paper argues
  that steady commercialization and, therefore, Westernization of its pop album
  market exemplified the GDR’s decision to concede the Cold War battle over the
  cultural preferences and political loyalties of its citizens for economic
  necessities.</p>
