abstract: |
    <p>Approximately 1 in 5 college students report having some type of disability (U.S. Department of Education 2019). Only about 30% of these students register for assistance in college, and only 17% of those with <em>learning</em> disabilities register (Krupnick 2014). This statistic is troubling when you consider that only about 34% of students with disabilities finish a four-year degree (Mader &amp; Butrymowicz 2017).</p>
    <p>Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an educational theory that seeks to create an inclusive, accessible learning environment that enhances the learning of <em>all</em> students and reduces the need for individual accommodations. One of the basic principles of UDL is teaching through <em>multiple means</em> (CAST 2018), a strategy promoted by authors like Straus (2011) and Quaglia (2015) as a way of implementing UDL into the college music curriculum. This poster looks at the benefits of applying research in multisensory perception and crossmodal association to strengthen these approaches and make the music classroom more inclusive.</p>
    <p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that multimodal teaching can significantly improve the learning outcome for students with varying types of disabilities (Escobedo et al 2014; Obaid 2013; Guyer 1989), and it has been commonly incorporated into assistive technology (VÃ©lez-Coto et al 2017; Proulx 2014). This poster outlines relevant cognitive literature on crossmodal association and approaches to multimodal strategies in disability studies, then looks at how principles of crossmodal association can be used as design guidelines for creating and strengthening current teaching approaches, and offers example applications for incorporating these strategies into the college music classroom.</p>
