    <p><i>Crossmodal associations</i> are nonarbitrary relationships that the
    brain draws between features or dimensions of different sensory modes.
    Examples include audio-visual associations such as loudness-brightness and
    pitch-height. The brain also recognizes <i>intramodal associations</i>
    between features of the same sensory mode, such as pitch-tempo and
    brightness-angularity. Modal associations have become an important topic
    in cognitive neuroscience and psychology because of the significant
    influence they have on perception and the broad implications for this
    research outside of those fields. In music, these associations offer a
    means for describing analytical relationships between both musical and
    multimedia parameters. However, because of the specific nature of these
    studies, which often focus on only one parameter in a single context, it
    is difficult even for interdisciplinary researchers familiar with this
    work to navigate and apply modal associations in a broader way to
    analysis.</p>
    <p>This paper synthesizes relevant research from the cognitive literature
    and presents a tool for modeling multiple crossmodal and intramodal
    relationships within a single metric space. I begin by presenting an
    interactive online resource created for analysts to reference modal
    associations by parameter and find other known relationships. Based on
    shared features and transitive and reciprocal relationships, I argue that
    these associations can be broadly sorted into three categories or
    dimensions, and modeled using an analytical tool I’ve created called the
    Crossmodal and Intramodal Association (CIA) Model. I close by discussing
    some of the implications of congruent and incongruent associations and
    potential applications to analysis, composition, and performance.</p>
    <p>These affordances suggest further connections with phenomenological and
    cognitive theories of multistability (Idhe 2012, Karpinski 2012). By
    examining relationships between melodies in terms of these multistable
    possibilities, I offer a more sensitive account of the contour relations
    listeners may perceive within the music, providing a better understanding
    of Reich’s minimalist process.</p>
