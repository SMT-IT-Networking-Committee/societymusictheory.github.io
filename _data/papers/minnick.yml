abstract: |
  <p><i>Forbidden Planet</i>’s (1956) premiere electrified the burgeoning Sci-Fi
  genre, which dramatized the international exploration efforts of the Space
  Race, allowing audiences to witness and hear imagined cosmic landscapes. Louis
  and Bebe Barron’s fully electronic film score, the first of its kind, sparked
  the imagination of generations of Sci-Fi directors, composers, and enthusiasts
  to come. </p>
  <p>During the early stages of the Barrons’ electronic music experimentation,
  Louis read Norbert Wiener’s <i>Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in
  the Animal and the Machine</i> (1948), which theorizes the relationship
  between human-generated mechanics and electronics and structures of animals
  and other beings. Rather than using the then-available synthesizer or the
  theremin in their orchestration, the Barrons engineered their own electronic
  oscillators and circuits, applying the same mathematics and schematics found
  in Wiener’s book. This foundational connection to Wiener’s inquiries
  encourages us to consider an ecomusicological analysis, exploring the complex
  relationship between the natural and the non-natural present in the soundtrack
  as well as the film. This natural and non-natural relationship is manifested
  by the mechanical nature of the sound machines and their cybernetic design,
  and through their electroacoustic ties to characters both human and non-human,
  such as the humanoid Robby the Robot, and the Krell monster, a creation of Dr.
  Morbius’s subconscious. Furthermore, <i>Forbidden Planet</i>’s reworking of
  Shakespeare’s <i>The Tempest</i>, which has inspired numerous ecocritical
  readings, elucidates post-colonial theories of imperialism. Themes of conquest
  are common in Sci-Fi movies, in which unsustainable lifestyles on Earth have
  forced humans to search for new planets to settle.</p>
  <p>Ecomusicology has traditionally focused on Earth-based landscapes, but my
  research on <i>Forbidden Planet</i> expands its boundaries to the realms of
  outer space. Using the sound signatures of characters and settings, this paper
  shows how the Barrons’ sound machines construct a cosmic environment with
  objects and beings that exhibit the shared human/non-human relationship. From
  the invisible, dangerous Krell, to the harmless “Shangri-La” garden, an
  ecological reading of the music associated with <i>Forbidden Planet</i>’s
  humans, non-humans, and alien landscapes demonstrates how the soundtrack
  animates the complex elements of the forbidden planet Altair IV. </p>
