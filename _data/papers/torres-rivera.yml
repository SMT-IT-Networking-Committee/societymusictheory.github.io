title: "Collaboration, Politics and Technology in Rafael Aponte-Ledée’s Presagio de Pájaros Muertos"
abstract: |
    <p>Rafael Aponte-Ledée (b.1938), Puerto Rican fellow composer at CLAEM (1965-1966), once referred to Presagio de Pájaros Muertos (1966), a work for electroacoustic tape and reciter, as his boldest musical attempt at the Center. However, the absence of data about this work following the composer’s own decision to discard it in 1969 had represented a critical obstacle not only for the consideration of the composer’s aesthetical and political stances during those years, but also for a better reflection on early interdisciplinary artistic manifestations at the CLAEM.</p>
    <p>In this paper, according to comprehensive archival and ethnographic research, I address the composer’s interaction with the technology at CLAEM in order to reconstruct the work’s sonic and literary components. I pay particular attention to the fortuitous artistic collaboration that materialized during the premiere of the work between Aponte-Ledée, engineer Fernando von Reichenbach, and actor Norman Briski. Certainly, the work as premiered, despite the composer’s initial categorization for the piece, converged in a space between the musical and the theatrical, and his inability to replicate these specific circumstances through subsequent performances heavily influenced the decision to discard it. Therefore, I argue that, from Aponte-Ledée’s perspective, there was a conceptual transfer from the work as electroacoustic to the work as instrumental theatre. In other words, that in the same way that the act of preparing a tape for an electroacoustic piece crystallizes a particular sonic combination, his ultimate decision to discard it was triggered by his inability to crystallize the performative and spatial elements as they happened during the premiere. Throughout the analysis I highlight: 1) How the shared space of the ITDT stimulated artistic collaborations between different disciplines; 2) The correspondence, in Aponte-Ledée’s particular case, between politics and technological experimentation; and 3) The composer’s particular relation with his work vis-à-vis his status as an avantgarde/experimental composer.</p>
