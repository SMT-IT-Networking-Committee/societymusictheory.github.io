title: Textual Norms and Deformations in Beatles’ Bridge Sections 1963–67
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>When defining verses, choruses, and bridges, scholars of form in rock
    have identified sectional layout, harmony, hypermeter, and
    melodic/harmonic divorce as key musical features. By contrast, little
    attention has been paid to <i>textual</i> features of these sections, such
    as scansion and rhyme frequency. Our presentation shows that recurring
    types of textual contrast occur in verse and bridge sections in Beatles
    songs from 1963 to 1967. Verse sections are more likely to have irregular
    scansion, more frequent rhyme, and internal hypermetric elisions, while
    bridge sections are more likely to have regular scansion, less frequent
    rhyme, and regular hypermeter. These contrasting features form a robust
    norm in the Beatles’ music, and they illuminate the differing
    relationships between vocal persona and musical environment that often
    occurs in these two sections. Some songs thwart these norms for expressive
    purposes. For example, the bridge of “Doctor Robert,” is normative in its
    scansion and hypermeter, but deviates in its texture, harmony, and text in
    order to suggest the grotesque and create unfulfilled expectation. The
    bridge of “Yes It Is” departs from its expected pattern of rhyme,
    scansion, and hypermeter at a crucial turning point in the text,
    highlighting the lead singer’s complex psychological state. Our study
    shows that, in Beatles music, textual patterns of scansion and rhyme play
    a significant role in defining formal functions of different sections and
    constructing songs’ vocal personae.</p>
