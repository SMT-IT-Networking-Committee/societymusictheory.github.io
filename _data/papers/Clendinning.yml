abstract: | 
    <p>With exploration of 20<sup>th</sup>- and 21<sup>st</sup>-century Western concert music and popular musics well underway, and an established trajectory of study and teaching of European music practices of prior centuries, world music might be considered the final frontier for music theorists and pedagogues.  In the twenty-first century, musics from around the globe are more accessible than ever, with performances and practitioners closer to us than at any time before through technology, including print and recorded resources now online, videos on YouTube, and communication platforms, such as email, messaging apps, and Zoom. As was the case with prior expansions of the canon, world musics hold the potential to widen our understanding of all musics and to lead to new theoretical and analytical approaches.</p>
    <p>Engagement of world musics presents difficulties in that there are many practices worldwide, both current and historical, each with its own organizational system and conceptual framework; explorers also face language and cultural barriers, creating opportunities for misinterpretation or misappropriation.  As world music analysis is not currently a part of most graduate music theory curricula, world musics are unfamiliar and the learning curve can be steep.  Furthermore, concepts and frameworks associated with world music genres may conflict with the way we currently summarize Western art music, especially in courses for undergraduates, making it challenging to simply insert some world music examples into a course about other musical genres. My presentation considers some of the challenges and also potential benefits of engaging world music within the music theory classroom.</p>
