    <p>Harry Partch’s theory of microtonality has affected American microtonalists such as Lou Harrison and Ben Johnston, as well as European microtonal composers including Georg Friedrich Haas and Wolfgang von Schweiniz. Yet no other European figure has absorbed Partch’s ideas more than German composer Manfred Stahnke. This paper approaches Partch’s theories not as an isolated paradigm, but in relation to Stahnke’s aesthetic and music—who has also sought to expand the intonational and tuning paradigms of Western art music. As Partch did, Stahnke has rejected the dominance of twelve-tone equal temperament, grappling with just intonation, as well as non-Western and ancient tuning systems. I demonstrate that Partch’s theory of microtonality—especially his concepts of tonality diamond, otonality, and utonality, as well as his microtonal scale—has influenced the melo-harmonic structures in Stahnke’s operas <em>Der Untergang des Hauses Usher</em> (1981) and <em>Heinrich IV</em> (1986), and his instrumental pieces <em>Diamantenpracht</em> (2005) and <em>Partch Zither</em> (2007). For instance, Stahnke’s innovative harp tuning, which rests upon the intervals of just major-thirds and just minor-sevenths, stands at the center of his microtonal construction in his opera <em>Der Untergang des Hauses Usher.</em> Stahnke’s harp tuning conceives just intervals in otonality and utonality that, in the opera, depict beauty and terror respectively, and metaphorically relate these acoustical concepts to the elements in the storyline. Such otonality and utonality constructions demonstrate how Stahnke synthesizes Partch’s theories in his vocal and instrumental works.</p>
