abstract: |
  <p>Discourse on sound is rich in American case law pertaining to property, but
  the ramifications of major legal precedents on cities have not been closely
  examined. In particular, nuisance, a Common Law concept with an historical
  emphasis on sound, has an expanding role in the transformation of gentrifying
  and former industrially zoned neighborhoods. In this paper, I will study the
  impact of federal, state, and municipal legislation on the policing of sound
  in New York City, focusing on re-zoning, redevelopment, and actual policing
  practices in three neighborhoods in North Brooklyn from 1994 until the present
  day. The City’s priorities in the re-shaping of the built environment and
  demographics of Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Bedford Stuyvesant over the past
  twenty years are reflected in the varying usage of “Nuisance Abatement
  Protocols,” as adapted under Mayors Giuliani, Bloomberg, and De Blasio. The
  Nuisance Abatement Law itself, formed in 1976 and greatly expanded under Mayor
  Giuliani, empowers the NYPD to literally “take” property deemed disruptive or
  dangerous. The closure of nightclubs and concert venues throughout the city,
  alongside the greatly expanded discretionary street police powers awarded NYPD
  districts under Giuliani’s and subsequently, the current mayor De Blasio’s
  initial Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, may be seen variably as preceding,
  serving, or combining with market forces. By studying pivotal nuisance cases
  during these three mayors’ reigns, alongside sound-oriented initiatives
  relevant to residential life, such as the complaint line 311, and the “Noise
  Codes” of 2007, I hope to clarify the extent to which policing of sound has
  been a central tactic in destabilizing communities to enforce private
  redevelopment in the aftermath of urban renewal. Ideally, clarifying the
  relationship between sound, property, and the police in New York will improve
  insufficient circular models for gentrification currently being used to
  understand class struggle in residential and mixed-use urban areas.</p>
