        <p>Mingyue Li [李明月] is a DPhil candidate reading musicology at the University of Oxford, St Cross College, fully funded by Chinese Scholarship Council. She also holds a BA in musicology from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and an MPhil in Music Studies from the University of Cambridge, funded by Cambridge Commonwealth Trust. Her research interests are in areas including Western art music after 1945 and related aesthetical-philosophical theories, musical meaning and subjectivity, musical multimedia of the late 20th and 21st centuries, and global modernism. Mingyue’s doctoral thesis focuses on the distinctive concepts of sound and ways of listening emerging from the musical works of Salvatore Sciarrino and Helmut Lachenmann. Its central research question revolves around the perception of musical meaning and the condition of subjectivity (human and musical), both approached through a compound analytical-hermeneutic method that is reception- or perception-oriented.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>When interpreting extra-musical referents, Sciarrino scholars often embrace an array of metaphors borrowed from the physical world ranging from natural, environmental matters to bodily, physio-psychological sensations. Marco Angius (2016), above all, compares Sciarrinoʼs music as a whole to “a living organism.” Arguably, the “ecology of music/listening”—a kernel of Sciarrino’s musical poiesis—epitomizes a quasi-naturalist and sometimes naïve-seeming approach to expression and reception. This paper seeks to offer new perspectives on the music’s affinity with the physical world that goes beyond surface- and local-formal levels. Through a formal-morphological and perception-sensitive account of the music of <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Studi per L’Intonazione del mare</em>, I try to elaborate on the notion of “organic music,” opaquely articulated by the composer himself (Feneyrou 2013) as a search for a new type of post-tonal structural force.</p>
    <p>Sciarrino’s organicism, I suggest, pertains to a holistic aesthetics and Gestaltian thinking. In contrast to the slightly worn-out notion of musical organicism, Sciarrino’s formal principles could be justified by placing the core of the term anew within the broader view of chaos. Based on an ecological approach to the perception of musical meaning proposed by Eric Clarke (2005), this paper argues that points of correspondence could be made between the perception of sound organisation and some characteristic aspects of biological organisms (e.g. infinite variations of a prototype, self-organization, responding to stimuli) and of natural phenomena that are particularly studied within the framework of chaos theory (Madden 1999; Kramer 2016) (e.g., a complex event resulted from simple occurrences, fractal geometry, and intermittency).</p>
