abstract: |
    <p>When interpreting extra-musical referents, Sciarrino scholars often embrace an array of metaphors borrowed from the physical world ranging from natural, environmental matters to bodily, physio-psychological sensations. Marco Angius (2016), above all, compares Sciarrinoʼs music as a whole to “a living organism.” Arguably, the “ecology of music/listening”—a kernel of Sciarrino’s musical poiesis—epitomizes a quasi-naturalist and sometimes naïve-seeming approach to expression and reception. This paper seeks to offer new perspectives on the music’s affinity with the physical world that goes beyond surface- and local-formal levels. Through a formal-morphological and perception-sensitive account of the music of <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Studi per L’Intonazione del mare</em>, I try to elaborate on the notion of “organic music,” opaquely articulated by the composer himself (Feneyrou 2013) as a search for a new type of post-tonal structural force.</p>
    <p>Sciarrino’s organicism, I suggest, pertains to a holistic aesthetics and Gestaltian thinking. In contrast to the slightly worn-out notion of musical organicism, Sciarrino’s formal principles could be justified by placing the core of the term anew within the broader view of chaos. Based on an ecological approach to the perception of musical meaning proposed by Eric Clarke (2005), this paper argues that points of correspondence could be made between the perception of sound organisation and some characteristic aspects of biological organisms (e.g. infinite variations of a prototype, self-organization, responding to stimuli) and of natural phenomena that are particularly studied within the framework of chaos theory (Madden 1999; Kramer 2016) (e.g., a complex event resulted from simple occurrences, fractal geometry, and intermittency).</p>
