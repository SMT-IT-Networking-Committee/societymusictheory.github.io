title: "‘We Need You to Get This Right’: Hip-Hop Communities and the Responsibilities of the Scholar"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>This presentation articulates the need for hip-hop scholars to consider
  their responsibilities to the artists and communities they study. Having
  worked with various hip-hop communities since 2000, I have heard a variety of
  concerns about how scholars engage with practitioners. Based on invaluable
  advice I have received from artists and drawing on the best practices of
  ethical ethnography, I offer four recommendations: Show respect; Heed the
  voices of the community; Reciprocate; and Collaborate. In doing so, I argue,
  we can do right by the community and in the process produce meaningful,
  compelling scholarship.</p>
