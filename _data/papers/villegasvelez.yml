abstract: |
  <p>Between 2009 and 2014, Mapa Teatro Bogotá produced two multimedia operas
  that set the Orpheus myth in twentieth-century Latin American contexts. The
  first, <i>Orfeo y Eurídice en Cielo Drive 10050</i> (2009), stages a dialogue
  between the classical myth and the 1969 murder of Sharon Tate. Reproducing
  Gluck”s opera with little transformation, <i>Cielo Drive 10050</i> employs two
  separate performing spaces connected by live video streams, doubling and
  displacing the time and space of the baroque spectacle. The second, <i>Orfeo
  Chamán</i> (2014), freely combines the myth with local traditions: in place of
  a descent to the underworld, Orpheus undergoes a Shamanic initiation in the
  Amazon, guided by his jaguar double, Nauhal. The score by Christina Pluhar is
  a <i>pasticcio</i> that combines European baroque music, folk music from
  Europe and Latin America, and arrangements of songs by Simón Díaz and Pedro
  Aznar. In the tradition of Vinicius de Moraes’s 1956 <i>Orfeu da
  Conceição</i>, these works mobilize the Orpheus myth to reimagine the place of
  Latin American identity in the world.</p>
  <p>Contributing to discussions about the political function of ancient myth in
  opera (Feldman 2007; Calcagno 2012; Forment 2012), I argue that the
  performative adaptation of European myth in these two Latin American
  productions is caught up in a contradictory logic of replacing local
  particularity with universalist equality (Laclau 1992). According to this
  logic, only European culture preserves both particularity and universality,
  while Europe’s others must choose between them, often obtaining none. In this
  context, Mapa Teatro’s productions exhibit what I call a neobaroque strategy
  (Maravall 1986; Eggington 2010), that deploys aestheticized complexity (here
  conveyed by the presumedly universal multimedia stage and <i>pasticcio</i>
  score) to conceal particular social, historical, and racial realities. In
  <i>Cielo Drive 10050</i>, the gruesome murder becomes a mythical event with no
  real consequences, while in <i>Orfeo Chamán</i> various mythologies coexist
  without apparent tension with music from the seventeenth and twentieth
  centuries. In their appropriation of the ostensibly timeless Orpheus myth,
  these works expose a contradictory demand to sacrifice local specificity for
  the promise of belonging in a global stage that craves fetishized, spectacular
  difference.</p>
