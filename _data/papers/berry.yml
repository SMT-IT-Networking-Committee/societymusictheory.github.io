    <p>Due to the precarious nature of our jobs, contingent faculty are more likely to be aware of and sympathetic to issues in the lives of our students that may be interfering with their ability to learn. Many of us have experienced (or are experiencing) housing or food insecurity, the challenges of balancing work and family lives, or a whole host of other issues. The nature of our work puts us in contact with a large number of students—many of whom are in their first or second year at the university—who may be facing challenges. We need to be prepared to help the students navigate the system(s) in order to access the resources they need. This becomes increasingly difficult if we ourselves don’t have the resources that we need to do our jobs effectively. In this talk, I’ll share some examples from my nine years as a part-time lecturer in the University of Washington system.</p>
