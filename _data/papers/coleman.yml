abstract: |
  <p>Music critic and later comic book-writer Harvey Pekar, writing in <i>Down
  Beat</i>’s second issue of 1966, urges readers to resist the surging “cult of
  personality” emergent in debates on the “new thing” in jazz criticism. These
  self-appointed spokesmen for the avant-garde movement, Pekar warns, have a
  difficult time explaining what it is all about, substituting metaphysics,
  social politics, and “emotion-laden adjectives” for clear and precise
  analyses. Pekar’s counsel, I argue, lays bare experimental improvised music’s
  fraught epistemological terrain in the mid-1960s. The perceived ambiguity of
  the music’s intent and meaning encouraged the new thing’s strongest detractors
  to discredit it, along with the critics who endorsed it, as promoting an
  aesthetics of identity politics. In this paper, I explore the contours of this
  argument as presented in mid-60s criticism, but also outline how other
  writers, like Amiri Baraka, framed the new music’s intensity and opacity as a
  polemical project aimed at white bourgeois liberalism and the jazz industry’s
  oligopoly.</p>
  <p>Agency and ownership, on the part of both music creators and their
  audiences, are themes that emerge in this discourse. Specifically, abstraction
  in the new thing was targeted as the means through which an artist’s motives,
  as well as the integrity and value of the music itself, might be determined
  and judged. I consider how techniques of abstraction in the new thing
  disclosed, citing Phillip Brian Harper, a unique representation of “social
  facts” that subverted the expectation of legibility so central to modern jazz
  criticism and consumption in postwar United States. How the aesthetic
  challenge of the new thing might be framed as a matter of knowingness—a
  recognition of artists’ personhood and an acknowledgment of creative
  expression’s intrinsic politics—is my attempt to unravel experimentalism’s
  thorny reception in the music literature of this period. </p>
