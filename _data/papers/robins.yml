  <p>In his article “Action and Agency Revisited,” Seth Monahan presents a model
  of agency in absolute music, but he also recognizes the limits of his model
  for addressing vocal music. Concerning vocal personas, he asks, “as the source
  of a precise verbal utterance, might they represent some new class of agent
  altogether, one that may or may not be integrated into my hierarchy of
  relations?” A vocal persona appears to trivialize his model because every
  musical event can be attributed to the agency of the vocalist. Also, it is
  unclear whether the vocal persona aligns with the fictional composer,
  work-persona, or individuated elements. This paper presents a new agential
  model for texted works using contemporary popular music.</p>
  <p>My model, while conceptually similar to Monahan’s, shifts the focus from
  “the work” to a performance, creating new agential categories. The key to my
  model is the artist persona, which is crafted and projected by fictional
  producers. The artist persona creates a performance, manifesting a song
  persona that has the agency to act on and through individuated elements in the
  song. Strong and weak personas can be projected by the dual levels of the
  vocal persona based on the ability of the song persona to alter the
  individuated elements of a song. The dual level is manifest most clearly in
  songs featuring the double-tonic complex.</p>
