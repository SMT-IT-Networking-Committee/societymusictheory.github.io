title: Defining Phrases in Popular Music
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Phrases in common-practice music are traditionally defined by harmonic
    processes, particularly goal-directed progressions to tonic. In popular
    music, however, harmonic motion toward a tonic is not always present,
    making traditional approaches to phrase segmentation problematic. This
    paper presents a methodology for phrase segmentation using melodic
    activity that can be applied to a broad spectrum of popular music.</p>

    <p>Inconsistency in methodology between scholars highlights the analytical
    challenge of phrase segmentation in popular music. Applying the three
    primary criteria cited by scholars–unified melodic activity, goal-directed
    motion, and vocal breath/rest–can result in conflicting segmentations for
    the same musical excerpt. My methodology delineates phrases by melodic
    activity, specifically repetition and contrast between subphrases, and is
    modeled after phrase-structure research by Caplin (1998), Callahan (2013),
    and Richards (2016). Resulting common phrase paradigms include various
    sentence types, repeated subphrases, and rotated subphrases. Composite
    structures include periods, double periods, repeated phrases, modified
    repeated phrases, and rotated phrases.</p>

    <p>The primary goal of this research is to provide a systematic method
    that lacks ambiguity or ad hoc parameters for phrase segmentation. This
    approach provides consistent results, is applicable to music featuring
    recurring chord loops, allows for a detailed consideration of phrase
    structures across the variety of popular music styles, and opens the door
    to research into the interaction of phrase structure and large formal
    units.</p>
