abstract: |
  <p>Becoming a public scholar is a pursuit that can begin early in a musician’s
  professional training. In this presentation, I share three music theory
  outreach projects in which my students worked with members of the community to
  identify problems for which their musical knowledge and skills offered
  potential solutions. The goal was to create new musical ideas and
  opportunities for both students and community members through reciprocal
  collaborative engagement. Each project began with a question posed during the
  first class: “how might you change your world using music theory?” Answering
  this question involved identifying needs and opportunities in their
  communities, learning and applying theory-specific content, and developing the
  professional, communication, and organizational skills required to work
  productively with community partners. In the process, my students worked with
  museum directors, health clinic administrators, senior center program
  participants, adoption agencies, and a local high school community.</p>
  <p>Cultivating such encounters brings numerous pedagogical advantages. Because
  the projects’ musical problems, aesthetic questions, and compositional
  challenges emerge from the encounters with members of the community, students
  discover the tremendous value, consequence, and relevance of their knowledge
  and skills to addressing real problems. The educational experience is
  holistic; students are challenged to draw on and synthesize learning across a
  variety of subject areas (theory, applied study) and professional skills
  (e.g., writing, organizing, creative thinking). Finally, students learn to
  share their public contributions in a way that fosters ongoing
  interdisciplinary collaboration, increases professional visibility, and
  contributes to positive social narratives about the arts.</p>
