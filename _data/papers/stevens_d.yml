abstract: |
    <p>At its midpoint, J.S. Bach’s Prelude from the Suite for Solo Violoncello in
    G Major finds itself in crisis. The C2 of the exhilarating V4/2 chord in m. 22
    cannot resolve down by step, being the lowest note on the cello; its
    resolution is later accomplished by dissonance transfer. This paper develops
    an alternative reading of this chord by considering similar instances in
    pieces by J.S. Bach and other composers in which cadential dominants are
    preceded not by conventional predominant harmonies but by an alternative chord
    that harmonizes (<i> ̂4</i>) in the bass: the V4/2. By placing bass scale step
    in conflict with harmonic and contrapuntal tendencies, Bach assigns this
    inverted dominant seventh a new functional identity and alternative
    voice-leading resolutions that emerge from improvisational practice (fantasia,
    recitative) but are at odds with the narrow description given to this chord in
    modern music theory textbooks.</p>
    <p>Using voice-leading, register, harmonic, and motivic analysis, this paper
    examines the predominant V4/2’s characteristic features, including: (1) the
    direct ascent of the bass ((<i> ̂4</i>) ) toward the root of the cadential
    dominant ((<i> ̂5</i>) ); (2) high occurrence in the minor mode and preceded by
    N6; (3) occasional transfer of the (<i> ̂4</i>) to an upper voice for
    resolution; (4) use with inverted cadential 6/4 chords; (5) use of register
    and temporal lengthening to create rhetorical emphasis; and (6) its
    anticipatory quality and cadential proximity, which override the chord’s
    common voice-leading tendencies.</p>
