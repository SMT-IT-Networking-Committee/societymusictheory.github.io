    <p>This paper seeks to connect Schumann’s early compositions in sonata
    style to Classical traditions, while simultaneously exploring the new
    temporal and rhetorical effects his creative reimagining of the form
    achieves. While the past decade has seen a revival of interest in
    Schumann’s concept of sonata form, most of this research leaves aside the
    piano sonatas and other sonata form movements that constitute Schumann’s
    earliest published attempts in the genre. Using a combination of
    analytical methods including formal functions, tonal organization and
    metric dissonance, I establish a broader basis for understanding how
    Schumann approached his early works in large-scale form.</p>

    <p>Throughout the paper, I identify means by which Schuman subverts
    Classical sonata norms relating to formal boundaries and the resulting
    effects at both intrathematic and interthematic levels. On the
    intrathematic level, such effects include reorganization or deletion of
    beginning, middle or ending function at the phrase level to create
    local-level ambiguity. Such reorganizations also impact formal
    organization at the movement level, where they either again create more
    large-scale ambiguity, or in some cases, lead to greater integration
    between different levels of the formal hierarchy. On the interthematic
    level, Schumann uses the inherent parallelism of sonata form in the first
    movements of his Op. 11 and Op. 14 sonatas to redefine conventional formal
    boundaries, thus creating new rhetorical effects.</p>
