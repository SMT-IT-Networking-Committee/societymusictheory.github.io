abstract: |
    <p>The expressive landscapes of contemporary art music suggest the
    potential (and myth) in modernist and cosmopolitan orientations to offer
    an all-purpose perceptual aesthetics and inclusive musical language, one
    capable of extending across or undoing national borders. This tension or
    seeming contradiction between universal aspiration and the lived
    experience of composers, performers, and listeners intervenes in the gaps
    and interactions between understanding and experience, and in differing
    perceptual orientations and relationships of sexual difference and power
    negotiated within and between musical borders and boundary crossings.</p>

    <p>Drawing on the work of musicologist Brigid Cohen (2012, 2014), feminist
    philosophers Adriana Cavarero (2000, 2003), Luce Irigaray (2002), and
    Elizabeth Grosz (2005, 2011), and music theorist Nancy Rao (2007, 2014), my
    brief account of encountering Chen Yi’s music will suggest alternate lines of
    connection between its aesthetic practices, relational potential, <i>polis,</i>
    and commemorative impulses. Events and textures interact in such works as
    <i>As In a Dream</i> (soprano, pipa, zheng), <i>Memory</i> (solo violin),
    <i>Tu </i>(<i>Burning</i>), and <i>Dragon Rhyme</i> (movement 1) in a variety
    of ways, emerging from, popping out of, providing backdrops for, and becoming
    emblematic of specific emotional/affective characters and differential
    fabrics. Moving between, displacing and traversing—Chen Yi’s music, its
    dispositions, narratives, encounters and migrations, tangle self and
    community, borderland and nation, exile and place.</p>
