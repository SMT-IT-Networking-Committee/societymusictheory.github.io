abstract: |
  <p>Affect describes the sudden, immediate transformation that takes place when
  your hands become clammy and your heart beats quickly while listening to a
  performance with anticipation. It gives a name to the lump in your throat.
  Contemporary theorists in the humanities have recently become interested in
  affect as a corporeal, immediate, non-discursive alternative to the more
  general category of feelings; they contrast it with the theoretical tools of
  discourse and representation that dominated scholarship during the linguistic
  turn.</p>
  <p>In this talk I demonstrate how our current notion of affect was made
  possible through eighteenth-century aesthetic debates about music,
  representation, and imitation. In the early modern era, the affects were
  important components of an elaborate semiotic system that sought to explain
  the impact of art. Today, by stark contrast, affect is often explicitly
  opposed to theories of the sign and of representation; theorists describe
  affect as corporeal and immediate, working on our autonomic systems. But in
  fact this very opposition presupposes the outcome of what were turbulent
  theoretical developments within the musical <i>Affektenlehre</i>, or the
  doctrine of the affections.</p>
  <p>At first, theorists in the <i>Affektenlehre</i> tradition—like Heinichen
  and Mattheson—supposed that music had the ability to create representations as
  the other arts do, through the imitation of the natural world. But slowly
  theorists turned away from this view, unsatisfied with the taxonomic
  descriptions and explanations in music theoretical texts. These
  writers—Diderot, Planelli, and Engel among them—postulated that music did
  indeed have the ability to arouse affects in listeners, but it did not
  accomplish this through the traditional structure of imitation. Instead, they
  held, it bypassed that representational framework through sonic vibrations of
  the nervous system, thereby sympathetically attuning the soul of the listener.
  Music aroused the affects in a completely corporeal, immediate, non-discursive
  fashion. It was this moment within the <i>Affektenlehre</i> tradition—much
  neglected in current scholarship—that generated the late-eighteenth-century
  discourse on affective attunement [<i>Stimmung</i>] that has regained
  importance in the present day. </p>
