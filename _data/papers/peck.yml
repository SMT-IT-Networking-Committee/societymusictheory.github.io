    <p>Several scholars have acknowledged to varying degrees the associations between music and social class born from the French Directory (c. 1795–1799), in which the dissonant “noise” from popular, contemporary opéra-comiques became associated with violent Republicanism by counterrevolutionaries. “Melodic” music grounded in simple, diatonic harmony was by contrast described as embodying refined, noble, qualities. This paper explicates the motivations concerning how and why this semiotic network was maintained by the First Empire. Personal correspondence reveals that Napoleon and his high-level bureaucrats internalized this network when referencing both music and political affairs. These musico-political associations were also dispersed into the public consciousness by the state-surveyed press. Critic for the <em>Journal de l’Empire</em>, Julien-Louis Geoffroy, was recognized by the public as the aesthetic voice of the Empire. “Noisy” music was considered a product of both an uneducated <em>parterre</em> borne from the Revolution and an invasive influence by German music, and supporters of the Revolutionary style attacked Geoffroy and his peers as representatives of an elitist class who refused to recognize the value in the technical progress of musical techniques. By comparing excerpts of operas by Etienne Méhul, Rodolphe Kreutzer, Antoine Reicha, and others with writings that reference these works, I will analyze and identify dissonant harmonic techniques that the Empire eventually relegated to the periphery of Parisian musical culture.</p>
