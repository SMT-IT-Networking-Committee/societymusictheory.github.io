abstract: |
    <p>Like most 18th-century operatic renditions of the tale, the dramatic
    climax of Antoine Reicha’s <i>Sapho </i>(1822) occurs when the title
    character sacrifices herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs. Reicha’s
    musical setting of the scene is extraordinary by the standards of early
    19th-century opera, as it harmonizes a descending chromatic scale with
    sequential diminished seventh and second-inversion dominant seventh
    chords. Evidence suggests that this moment may have caught the attention
    of government censors, and Reicha opined over the musical changes forced
    upon the opera, particularly by the administrators of the Académie royale
    de musique, in his unpublished autobiography.</p>
    <p>Reicha’s opera might have been considered suspicious because of its
    relationship to another Sappho opera by Jean-Paul-Égide Martini that
    premiered in France in 1794. Martini’s opera is relatively unknown today,
    but several critics made connections between the two versions. Martini’s
    <i>Sapho</i> was among the most popular newly-composed works in Paris
    during the Thermidorian Reaction: its most striking feature is undoubtedly
    the 12-note chord found in the overture, recast as a 10-note harmony at
    the moment of sacrifice.</p>
    <p>David Charlton suggests that the libretto of Martini’s version (written
    by Constance de Salm) may contain hidden criticisms of policies championed
    by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror. My paper will solidify Charlton’s
    hypothesis by analyzing how Martini’s hyperdissonant chord functions as a
    signifier of Revolutionary failure, through examining relationships
    between the use of dissonance and Revolutionary iconography in the opera,
    allowing the sheer act of dissonance to be inextricably linked to
    narrative invocations of authoritarian violence.</p>
