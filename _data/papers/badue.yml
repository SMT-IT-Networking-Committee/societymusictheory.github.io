title: "In True South American Way: Aloysio De Oliveira’s Samba Arrangements for Carmen Miranda"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>When Carmen Miranda left Brazil and arrived in the United States in 1939
  she was joined by six musicians, the Moon Gang (<i>Bando da Lua</i> in
  Portuguese). The Gang’s guitar player and main vocalist, Aloysio de Oliveira,
  became a close friend of Miranda’s not just because of his talent as a
  performer and arranger, but also because he was the only one in the group who
  could communicate in English. In this paper, I demonstrate Oliveira’s
  contributions to Miranda’s success on Broadway and Hollywood and revisit his
  impact on her career. While her persona, costumes, and dance movements, which
  were her own creation, found criticism for misrepresenting Brazil and its
  people, her songs did not. I argue that Miranda’s American performances on
  stage and screen owned musical authenticity to Oliveira’s samba arrangements
  of not just Brazilian songs, but also those composed by American songwriters
  for movies and revues of which Miranda was the star. </p>
  <p>Oliveira had been an active musician in Rio de Janeiro in the 1930s, when
  samba became an urban musical genre and began to be appreciated by the upper
  classes. He was familiar with the musical style of the greatest
  <i>sambistas</i> of the decade and brought that style to his arrangements for
  Miranda. I will delineate this style of samba songs from the 1930s, focusing
  on instrumentation and rhythmic cadences, and demonstrate how it appears in
  selected arrangements by Oliveira from the early 1940s. I also consider his
  arrangements from a political perspective. The Moon Gang accompanied Miranda
  because the Brazilian president, Getulio Vargas, purposefully aimed at using
  Brazilian popular music to improve diplomatic relations with the United States
  and funded the Gang’s trip with Miranda so that they could all perform at the
  Brazilian pavilion of the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Thus, this paper
  ultimately shows that through the Good Neighbor Policy, Oliveira helped to
  consolidate not just Carmen Miranda in American culture, but also Brazilian
  popular music, since his arrangements were the first time many Americans from
  coast to coast heard Brazilian music and samba songs. </p>
