    <p>Expressive timing in hip-hop flow concerns the practice whereby an MC (rapper) inflects their flow rhythms on a miniscule scale not easily representable with standard musical notation—how far “ahead” or “behind” the beat they rap. Adams (2015) and Kautny (2015) position expressive timing as an integral part of hip-hop flow and Ohriner (2017 and 2019) discusses it in greater detail. This paper complements their work by surveying flow timing across the broader hip-hop genre.</p>
    <p>I identify three broad practices of expressive timing in flow. <em>Swung timing</em> subdivides the tactus unequally, similar to a common jazz drum timekeeping pattern. <em>Lagging timing</em> refers to the patterned delay of flow rhythm in relation to the underlying instrumental or sampled beat. And <em>conversational timing</em> pertains to flow performances that resemble rhythmic patterns idiomatic of spoken language. I use theoretical and notational concepts developed by Benadon (2006, 2009) and Ohriner (2019) to illustrate the extent to which a flow performance involves these approaches to expressive timing, and propose analytical methods for these approaches that highlight their functional and rhetorical appeal. I also consider expressive timing in light of Signifyin(g) in African American music (Floyd Jr., 2002), groove-based expressive microtiming (Iyer, 2002), Afrocentric models of rhetoric (Jackson, 1995), and narrativity. My analyses of performances by LL Cool J, Snoop Dogg, Queen Latifah, and Eminem illuminate the variegated approaches to expressive timing in hip-hop flow—specifically in how they relate to musical function and performance rhetoric.</p>
