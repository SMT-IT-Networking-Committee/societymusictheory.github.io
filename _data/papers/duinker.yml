abstract: |
    <p>This paper investigates segmentation and phrasing in the rapped vocals,
    or flow, of hip-hop music. The main—but by no means the only—techniques
    MCs (rappers) use to organize lyrics into flow are rhyme, rhythm, breath
    patterning, and syntactic closure. Ohriner (2016) notes that rhyme,
    syntactic closure, and breathing are usually the most prevalent markers of
    such organization, but he suggests that using each of these markers to
    analytically segment a passage of flow would reveal different segmentation
    structures for the same passage. I explore this issue by undertaking a
    segmentation-based analysis of passages of flow drawn from old-school
    (1979–85), Golden-Age (1986–93), and late-1990s hip-hop music, using
    examples from Roxanne Shanté, Eric B. & Rakim, and The Notorious B.I.G. to
    suggest that flow styles emerging in the Golden Age and onward
    increasingly feature passages that produce multiple, divergent
    segmentations depending on the criteria used to segment them. These
    divergences complicate efforts to define what constitutes a phrase of
    flow, a complex notion explored by Condit-Schultz (2016) and Adams (2017),
    but otherwise only receiving implicit definition or passing mention in
    recent hip-hop scholarship. Adapting the work of Rothstein (1989), Attas
    (2011), and Condit-Schultz, I propose a method of discerning flow phrases
    by considering the aural salience of segmentation markers, the groupings
    these markers suggest, the internal, motional characteristics of these
    groupings, and their metric relationship with the song’s beat layer
    (sampled or instrumental accompaniment).</p>
