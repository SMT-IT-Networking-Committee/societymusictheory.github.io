  <p>This paper investigates chord loops built around two major chords and one
  minor chord, all related by step. While many popular songs using these
  chords can be analyzed with the Aeolian progression—VI, VII, and i—recent
  songs by Justin Bieber, The Chainsmokers, and others use loops where the
  chords can be interpreted as IV, V, and vi. I interrogate the tonality of
  these songs, advancing the concept of <i>hybrid tonic</i>. Hybrid tonics
  occur when a song, or song section, lacks a salient Ionian (major) tonic on
  which both the harmony and melody concur. Instead, IV—or less often,
  vi—chords can function rhetorically and syntactically as tonic, especially
  when the chords sound simultaneously with a melodic ^1, occur in a
  metrically strong position, and initiate a chord loop. In functioning
  rhetorically and syntactically as tonics, hybrid tonics constitute an
  extension of work by Harrison (1994) and Nobile (2016) that decouples
  harmonic function from scale degree, while complementing Spicer’s (2017)
  theory of fragile, emergent, and absent tonics. The consideration of hybrid
  tonics in pop music reflects the combined role that melody and harmony play
  in creating tonal focus while also acknowledging the independence of these
  textural layers. In songs where melody and harmony fail to express a unified
  tonality based on a single pitch class, positing hybrid tonics can offer a
  means of reconciliation. </p>
