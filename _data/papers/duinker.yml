    <p>This paper investigates metric displacement dissonance (Harald Krebs,
    2009) between hip-hop music’s main textural layers: flow (the rapped vocals)
    and beat (the instrumental track). In hip-hop music, such dissonance occurs
    when syntactic units of the flow and metric units of the beat exhibit
    groupings that are out of phase with each other. The analyses put forward in
    this paper suggest that the perception of displacement dissonance in hip-hop
    music can involve two features. First, while the dissonance is often easy to
    identify by ear, it is not always clear which textural layer is referential
    and which is dissonant. Second, because of musical attributes common to
    hip-hop such as looped harmonic and metric units, displacement dissonances
    might remain unresolved or behave inconsistently in their resolutions.</p>

    <p>I model hypothetical hearings of displacement dissonance for songs by A
    Tribe Called Quest, Nas, and Kool Keith. These models demonstrate that
    multiple hearings of meter are possible when the dissonance remains in
    flux and/or does not resolve. In the context of electronic dance music,
    Mark Butler (2006) describes the possibility of multiple hearings and
    non-resolution of dissonance respectively as interpretive multiplicity and
    the emancipation of metric dissonance. By showing how displacement
    dissonance between hip-hop music’s textural layers engages with these
    concepts, this paper demonstrates the value of studying musical meter by
    situating the listening experience as the object of analysis.</p>
