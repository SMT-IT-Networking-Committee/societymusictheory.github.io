abstract: |
  <p>Recent work in nineteenth-century music has embraced mundane musical moments
  to affirm music’s agency within technological, medicinal, or political
  discourses. Among the goals of “quirk historicism” is to situate dross
  alongside the canon to paint a clearer ethnographic or microhistorical picture
  (Smart and Mathew 2015). This paper assesses the still underexplored relations
  between the unusual, the ubiquitous, and the subversive in nineteenth-century
  French music, specifically regarding the wildly popular but misunderstood genre
  of street song known as the <i>scie</i>.</p>
  <p>A <i>scie</i> was a repetitive song, often with nonsensical text, intended
  to provoke laughter. One such <i>scie</i> was “Ohé! Lambert!” by Félix
  Baumaine. Inspired by a wife shouting for her husband in the Bois de Vincennes,
  it became a sensation in 1864 following performances by the café singer
  Alexandre Legrand. The “Lambert” craze peaked on August 15; as Napoléon III
  paraded through Paris’s streets to celebrate the imperial holiday known as the
  Saint-Napoléon, a group of street urchins counteracted chants of <i>Vive
  l’Empereur!</i> with <i>Voilà Lambert!</i> The incident made headlines in Paris
  and London, with journalists taking the opportunity to critique the Second
  Empire’s self-aggrandizement through spectacle. “Lambert” outlived the scandal,
  as evidenced by piano transcriptions recently recovered in the Bibliothèque
  nationale de France. Decades later, the Marxist critic Siegfried Kracauer cited
  “Lambert” as symptomatic of Parisian modernity and its penchant for ephemera.
  The song’s broad commercial and critical reach, then, allows for a fresh
  perspective on the distribution of sonic and political agency in Second Empire
  France. </p>
  <p>By analyzing the decades-long reception history of “Lambert,” this paper
  explores a little-known “quirk” moment in Parisian history to investigate the
  tensions between street music and sonic manifestations of empire.
  Saint-Napoléon festivities saturated the urban soundscape: outdoors, doting
  <i>claquers</i> praised the emperor during his parade around the city while
  indoors, theaters presented free, day-long propaganda shows. “Lambert,” then,
  countered this imperial ubiquity with subversive ubiquity. I argue that
  “Lambert” became “political” precisely through its perceived innocence: by
  including the song in their reviews of Napoleonic parades, critics demonstrated
  how easily the Second Empire’s aesthetic of <i>fête impériale</i> could be
  diluted into a farcical spectacle.</p>
