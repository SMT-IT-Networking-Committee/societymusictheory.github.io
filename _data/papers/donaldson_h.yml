abstract: |
  <p>Benjamin Britten’s <i>Rejoice in the Lamb</i> op. 30 (1943), a rhythmically
  complex anthem set to vivid, animist poetry, is emblematic of the Church of
  England’s engagement with modernist artworks on sacred themes in the
  mid-twentieth century. Amid the devastation of the German air raids and the
  strictures of wartime austerity, the Anglican clergyman Walter Hussey began an
  ambitious project of commissioning sacred art from early-career English artists
  working in a modernist idiom. His inaugural commission of Britten incited an
  artistically fruitful friendship that lasted until Britten’s final days. Hussey
  went on to commission similarly enduring pieces from Henry Moore, Leonard
  Bernstein, and Marc Chagall.</p>
  <p>Drawing on correspondence, manuscript scores, and reviews gathered at the
  Britten-Pears Library and the West Sussex County Council office at Chichester,
  I examine the background, production, and reception of Britten’s <i>Rejoice in
  the Lamb</i> in context with the other artworks Hussey commissioned during the
  war. As I suggest, this collaboration of composer and clergyman sheds light on
  Britten’s activities within the Church of England as part of the broader
  project of the Church’s public engagement with nation building during wartime.
  Heather Wiebe (2015) has argued convincingly that English patrons of the arts
  anticipated the task of rebuilding the cultural life of England even during
  wartime, and that Britten played an important role in activities of English
  postwar reconstruction. Alexandra Harris (2010) has illuminated the church’s
  place in the wartime flourishing of public interest in the arts, and its
  engagement with English modernist artists. What has not been fully appreciated,
  however, is Britten’s unique contribution to the continuity of modernist
  artistic activities during the war. Britten guided Hussey’s selection of which
  artists to patronize, and made overtures to composers on his behalf. Hussey,
  for his part, shrewdly employed <i>Rejoice in the Lamb</i> to bolster support
  and understanding for his continuing modernist commissions in wartime within
  his parish and in the wider community. Having once lamented that “the arts had
  become largely divorced from the Church,” Hussey found in Britten a means to
  rekindle a relationship which he felt had largely broken down in the modern
  era.</p>
