abstract: |
  <p>Based on intermittent ethnographic observations begun in 2015 and
  ethnographic interviews this presentation explores the intersections of faith,
  ethnicity, and politics in the performances of mariachi music in Catholic
  masses at the Basilica of Our Lady of San Juan Del Valle, a shrine located in
  the border town of San Juan, Texas. The use of mariachi in the liturgy indexes
  the largely Latino/a/x make-up of the population in the Rio Grande Valley, and
  highlights the Mexican heritage of the region. Despite currently being the
  largest ethnic minority in the United States, this group has come under attack
  with the rise of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate and his subsequent
  election in 2016. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, and his calls
  for a border wall advance an “us vs. them” vision of identity. The history and
  culture of the Rio Grande Valley, as evidenced in mariachi masses, challenge
  the dichotomous worldview permeating current political discourse. I explore
  these intersections of religion, identity, and politics, by situating mariachi
  mass performances in two related contexts: 1) the historical relationships
  between Mexican/Mexican-Americans and Catholicism in the United States, and 2)
  the current political climate and its hegemonic and exclusionary assertions of
  national identity. I argue that mariachi masses at the San Juan basilica
  challenge the Hispanic/Anglo and citizen/immigrant binaries by representing
  the convergence of multiple histories, cultures, and political persuasions all
  while maintaining strong connections to the Hispanic heritage of the
  region.</p>
