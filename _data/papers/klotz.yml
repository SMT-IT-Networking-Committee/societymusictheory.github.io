title: "Dave Brubeck in the Living Room: Race, Gender, and Respectability in the Conversion of a “New” Jazz Audience"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Throughout his career, white jazz pianist Dave Brubeck boasted of his
  ability to “make converts” of respectable audiences—audiences typically
  frightened away by racist stereotypes of jazz. Likewise, he was touted by
  critics and promoters as a “jazz evangelist” who opened jazz to a new
  audience. In each case, words like “new” and “respectable” served as implicit
  markers of race and class; Brubeck’s audience was “new” because it was white
  (never mind the fact that white audiences had listened to jazz since its
  beginning), and it was “respectable” because it was comprised of middle and
  upper-middle class whites. However, Brubeck’s appearances in magazines such as
  <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Good Housekeeping</i> demonstrated that part of the
  “newness” of Brubeck’s “respectable” audience was its gender—and more
  specifically that Brubeck could draw white middle class women to jazz. </p>
  <p>Whether embodying Brubeck’s performances at the piano, performing with him
  at the piano bench, listening to his music, or composing music like his,
  mid-century white women were an active part of Brubeck’s audience. This paper
  focuses on the white, middle-class women who comprised a significant portion
  of Brubeck’s audience. It is thus part of musicological interest in women’s
  engagement with jazz (Tucker; Griffin; Guillory; Kelley; Wells) as well as in
  the relationship between jazz and gender more broadly (Monson; Ake; Kelley;
  Ramsey). Through extensive archival work, this paper examines the stories told
  by the women who wrote to Brubeck of their experiences with his music,
  offering a space for their stories to become part of a jazz historical canon
  that continues to assert that women do not like jazz. At the same time, this
  paper interrogates the interest of these women in so-called “respectable” jazz
  musicians like Brubeck, arguing that their engagement with his music
  demonstrates the extent to which white female audiences increasingly
  considered jazz to be both capable of domestication and part of an
  aspirational consumerist economy. Put simply, they could maintain the
  privileges of respectability they received based on their intersecting race,
  class, and gender identities, while still enjoying jazz as performed by
  musicians like Brubeck.</p>
