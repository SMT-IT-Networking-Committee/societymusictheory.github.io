abstract: |
    <p>As defined by James Hepokoski in 1993, a rotation is an ordered series of musical elements through which a work or movement passes two or more times. Since its coinage the term has been widely discussed and applied in the analysis of Western music, but its conceptual underpinnings have not yet been explored.</p>
    <p>I seek to shed light on these underpinnings by proposing that rotational theory springs from a conception of musical form as <em>ritual</em>. The layout of rotational form coincides with a conventional understanding of ritual structure, whereby the referential statement corresponds to the ritual’s initial performance, and subsequent rotations to its repetition. Moreover, rotational theory’s most distinctive features—including seriality, modeling, invariance, rule-governance, and spatiality (cf. the metaphors of circularity, “zones,” “action-spaces,” and “thresholds”)—are those that theorists of ritual identify as typical of the phenomenon. Indeed, Hepokoski himself refers at one point to musical rotations as “rituals of circularity”—language that should not be taken lightly.</p>
    <p>My argument divides into three sections. The first defines the rotation, traces its development as a concept within Hepokoski’s publications, and summarizes its critique. The second argues for the importance of Northrop Frye and Mircea Eliade’s writings on myth and ritual for rotational theory. The third identifies three topics—performativity, framing, and <em>habitus</em>—that Hepokoski’s work shares with recent theories of ritual. Building upon this work, I conclude by proposing a theory of musical <em>formativity</em>: the propensity for music, as a structure of ritualized (virtual) habitation, to form cultural subjects.</p>
