  <p>For more than two hundred years, conventional harmonic theories have
  recognized three types of augmented-sixth chords: Italian, French, and German.
  In their standard position, these chords all have a major third above the
  bass. In late-tonal styles, however, various types of augmented-sixth chords
  featuring a minor third (or augmented second) abound. The only one of these to
  have received substantial theoretical attention is the “half-diminished”
  augmented-sixth, but this variant is only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the
  surface lies a large family of other “minorized” augmented-sixth chords and
  the time is ripe to examine these neglected chords systematically. Because I
  have found these chords to be especially prominent in late-tonal Swedish
  repertoire, I dub this new family “Swedish sixths.” However, this is no more
  intended as a literal descriptor of national style than the traditional
  Italian, French, and German appellations.</p>
  <p>I propose that recognition of the co-existence of <i>two</i> broad families
  of augmented-sixth sonorities and their resolutions—the standard family, with
  a major third above the bass, and the family investigated here, with a minor
  third—is a significant step towards our understanding of the breadth of
  chromatic possibilities at work in the late-tonal repertoire. I begin with the
  common variants of Swedish sixths and their different resolutions and voice
  leading. Then, borrowing methods of Harrison (1994) and Swinden (2005), I
  present several insights into the harmonic function of Swedish sixths by
  describing how they permit new types of functional mixture and enharmonic
  modulations. </p>
