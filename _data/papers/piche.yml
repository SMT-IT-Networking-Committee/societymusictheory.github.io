    <p>Fétis’s treatise, known for its historical approach to <em>tonalité</em>, is also a visionary work that anticipated some of the most iconic sonorities of the late nineteenth century. Fétis acknowledged that the extensions of tonality he illustrated “generate a large number of new chords not yet employed by composers.” Among these new chords are “half-diminished” augmented sixths that have gone largely unremarked in the Fétisian literature (Christensen 2019, Campos 2013) and that closely resemble Wagner’s Tristan chord (1865) and Strauss’s “Till sixth” (1895). How did Fétis manage to theorize these chords that were only composed decades later?</p>
    <p>Fétis wrote extensively about Wagner in later publications but never discussed harmony specifically (Christensen 2019). His treatise nevertheless gives insight into how the Tristan chord might be accommodated within his tonal theory: for Fétis, the augmented sixth did not constitute a genuine harmony since it results from two simultaneous suspensions. In contrast, he regarded the “Till sixth” as a legitimate chord (V7) where ęć and ěă replace Ć and ă. Although these modifications occur in earlier treatises, Fétis appears to be the first to combine them.</p>
    <p>Early twentieth-century theorists––Louis and Thuille, Schoenberg, Vinée––became increasingly interested in explaining new, non-standard augmented sixths; unsurprisingly, they recognized a wider range of resolutions than Fétis. His accomplishment in the <em>Traité complet</em> is nevertheless remarkable. It is precisely because he based his tonal theory on abstract principles rather than contemporaneous practices that he managed to predict extensions of tonality that became commonplace in the late Romantic era.</p>
