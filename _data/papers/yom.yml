    <p>Jazz scholars generally agree that musical improvisation makes reference to preexisting schemas—these are collectively called “the referent.” There are two prevalent ways of understanding the referent. In the <em>computational view</em>, the referent is a fixed object, unaffected by the improvisation (Pressing, 1984). In what I will call the <em>interactive view</em>, the referent is a living, evolving process that changes in response to the improvisation (Love, 2017). Both views, however, fail to take sufficient account of the role of the observer: the listener/theorist. In a close analysis of “period 2” in <em>Tree of Life </em>by Cecil Taylor, in which I will play the role of the observer, I will show that taking the observer into account complicates a stable notion of the referent due to the self-referentiality of the listener. In what I call the referent's double, the listener's innumerable references in the process of listening include the relationship of notation to sound, embodiment of gesture, emotion and affect as it is encoded in music, and the relationship of listening to analysis. I argue that factoring in the register of the listener, or the observer who makes sense of the music to nominate the factors from which to draw and theorize the referent, destabilizes the notion of the referent. Listening to improvisation, like improvisation, involves inter-referentiality inherent to any listening subject, including the music theorist.</p>
