abstract: |
  <p>Scholarship of girl groups of the 1960s has traditionally depicted these
  women as being powerless cogs in a sleek, candy-coated record production
  machine. Many of these arguments are based on the aesthetics of the ensemble,
  their depictions of white middle-class femininity and their lack of agency in
  writing and producing their own songs. More recent scholarship has emphasized
  girl groups, such as the Shangri-Las, as representing teenage rebellion and
  sexual exploration (Stras 2010, MacLeod 2015). </p>
  <p>While taking this previous scholarship into mind, I approach the girl
  groups’ songs of tragedy as rooted in the history of Western lament.
  Specifically, I study “coffin songs” (also known as “splatter platters” and
  “death discs”). These songs, produced by both male and female musical groups
  of the 1950s and 60s, often depicted tragic teenage death and loss in a
  melodramatic fashion. Some formalized aspects of lament are identifiable in
  this genre: spoken dialogue, static recitative-like melodies, and voice
  strain. I consider these aspects alongside sociopolitical contexts of race and
  class to situate how lament works in the “coffin song” as it was performed by
  girl groups.</p>
  <p>My paper addresses lament by using the group the Shangri-Las as my primary
  object of study, though I incorporate examples of other groups such as the
  Supremes. I focus on the way the Shangri-Las performed lament in conjunction
  with their performance and subversion of whiteness and respectability. I
  incorporate these distinctions in my study to determine the effect of race and
  class on the depiction of lament in the “coffin songs” of this group. I argue
  that the Shangri-Las’ lamenting performances were affected by their subversion
  of respectability, afforded them by their identity as white women. </p>
