abstract: |
    <p>While the term "voice-leading" in undergraduate music theory courses
    often refers to chorale harmonization or species counterpoint,
    Neo-Riemannian theory offers another way of engaging deeply with the
    succession of harmonies and the movement of individual voices. This paper
    advocates for including Neo-Riemannian theory in core undergraduate theory
    courses, and outlines a modular sample curriculum. A unit on
    Neo-Riemannian theory can be invigorating for students, as it offers them
    new ways of thinking about chromatic music, and of re-interpreting other
    frequently taught topics such as modal mixture. And as a capstone to the
    "tonal" portion of the undergraduate curriculum, Neo-Riemannian theory can
    serve as a gentle introduction to many of the concepts introduced in the
    "20th-century‚Äù course that often ends the sequence. Simple and direct
    examples serve as a jumping-off point: students can sing or notate
    straightforward transformations. Later in the unit, consideration of the
    many geometric models of tonal space prepares students to deal with the
    abstractions and operations of pitch-class set theory, or to navigate the
    difficulties of dealing in abstractions away from the musical surface.
    Such examples also lend themselves to compelling visual analyses, which
    students can use as they listen to music, and which they often enjoy
    producing themselves. Finally, Neo-Riemannian theory offers the
    opportunity to incorporate new repertoires into the undergraduate core
    curriculum: not only the highly chromatic 19th-century music originally
    addressed by the theory, but also popular music, film music, jazz, and
    other styles.</p>
