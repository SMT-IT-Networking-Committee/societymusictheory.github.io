title: "Musical Topics in Mozart’s Piano Sonatas: A Data Science Approach"
handouts: []
abstract: |
    <p>Extending from the work of Ratner, Agawu, and Monelle, recent
    scholarship in topic theory has set to more clearly define the musical
    elements that create a topic. Contributions from Rumph and Frymoyer
    provide ways of considering the constituent elements of a topic
    (<i>figurae</i>) both in isolation and in relation to one another. The
    resulting lists of <i>figurae</i> not only aid analysts in understanding
    topics but also suggest that these features could be identified in a
    machine-learning context. In this interactive poster session, we will show
    the promising results of our first forays into computational analysis of
    musical topics. Specifically, our findings demonstrate applications of
    data science methods that have implications for both further analytical
    inquiry and the dissemination of research concerning musical topics.</p>
    <p>Our data science approach included the steps of data gathering and
    cleaning, exploratory visualization and analysis, and predictive modeling.
    After completing an analysis of the topoi in Mozart’s piano sonatas by
    measure, we combined humdrum formatted versions of the scores and the
    music21 music analysis software library to extract a wealth of features
    about each analytical segment. In addition, we have used early data
    visualizations to help identify areas for further exploration; these
    visualization tools suggest new ways of considering the presentation of
    information about topics in general, as well as the topics within Mozart’s
    piano sonatas specifically. Finally, we have begun to use the extracted
    data to develop predictive models of topics within the sonatas.</p>
