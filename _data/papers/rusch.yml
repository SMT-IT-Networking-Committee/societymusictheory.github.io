    <p>This paper explores how form and cadential closure can affect our
    perception of musical passages that cross an enharmonic seam, particularly
    in cases where the relationships between harmonies or tonal regions can be
    construed as diatonically indeterminate. Using Tovey’s (1928) discussion
    of Schubert’s Piano Sonata in G Major, D. 894, as a point of departure, I
    consider two related passages from the Piano Sonata in B-flat Major, D.
    960, i (mm. 1–80 and 216–258), both of which feature the same enharmonic
    juncture. For each passage, I compare a diatonic hearing to a
    neo-Riemannian one, using Caplin’s theory of formal functions (1998) and
    cadential closure (2004, 2018) as a heuristic guide. I suggest that a
    diatonic and neo-Riemannian hearing can converge in the second passage
    from D. 960, because the double return of the reprise and home key within
    the main theme’s apparent ternary design confirms the global tonic, B-flat
    major, regardless of the enharmonic shift. With respect to the first
    passage from D. 960, I propose that the two hearings of the tonal regions
    may diverge; closure in both F-sharp minor and A major can encourage us to
    regard the exposition’s final region, F major, as diatonically remote from
    the global tonic. Repeating the exposition not only restores the link
    between these two regions, but also invites us to reconfigure the tonal
    relationships perceived in our initial hearing. My paper concludes by
    contemplating the value of diatonic indeterminacy and by considering how
    the two hearings of the first passage can be complementary.</p>
