    <p>The voice holds psychological power. It can be an expression of inner feelings and a helpful tool in processing trauma. In discussing the singing voice, timbre provides an aural expression of these feelings performed outwardly. To show how vocal timbre expresses the journey through trauma and rehabilitation, I show how it provides a post-traumatic recovery narrative in Kesha’s very first ballad, “Praying.” More specifically, my analysis demonstrates how Kesha’s voice—through use of various registers, laryngeal positions, timbral effects, and positions within the musical environment—portrays symptoms of trauma and recovery, including improving thought patterns, an increasing ability to connect with others, and a growing sense of emotional strength and control.</p>
    <p>Kesha wrote her album <em>Rainbow</em> (2017) as self-therapy responding to traumatic abuse from her producer, Dr. Luke. In her compelling power ballad, “Praying,” she discusses her experience through trauma and recovery, and I argue that her voice reinforces this story. I engage with scholarship in trauma studies and music theory (van der Kolk 2014; Herman 1997; Malawey 2020; Heidemann 2016; Moore 2012) to show how her voice demonstrates her journey through abuse and rehabilitation in therapy. I also discuss the impact “Praying” has had on listeners, especially trauma survivors, and the ways that the voice can showcase emotional expression. In examining the ways that Kesha’s voice portrays her journey in “Praying,” my analysis provides a deeper understanding of vocal expression in popular songs and insight into trauma’s effects, including how they can be embodied in the voice.</p>
