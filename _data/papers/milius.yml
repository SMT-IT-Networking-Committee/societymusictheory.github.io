    <p>After learning horrific details about musicians we love—e.g., John Lennon, Michael Jackson— we are met with a choice: to continue listening to, analyzing, and using these examples, or to abandon them and look for other material. Some of us, for our own benefit, are able to separate the artist from their art, while others are able to disregard accusations as false, or ignore them completely. In discussing this kind of “willful forgetting,” Claire Dederer says, “forgetting is easier for some than others” (Dederer 2017). In my discussion, I consider how trauma survivors, who are likely in every college classroom, can be triggered at the mention of musicians accused of these crimes.</p>
    <p>Trauma wreaks havoc on the mind and body, eliciting responses including hyperarousal of the nervous system, intrusive thoughts, dissociation, anxiety, and depression (van der Kolk 2014). The 2015 documentary film, <em>The Hunting Ground,</em> shows how common sexual assault is on college campuses—where many of us teach— and how our universities hide it. By acknowledging the amount of assault on campus, we must consequently acknowledge that we have taught, and will teach again, survivors of trauma. In this light, teaching works by musicians with well-documented accusations of abuse can remind trauma survivors of their experiences; doing so risks sending them into states of high alert or dissociation, or even forcing them to relive these experiences. Such stimuli can cause students to detach from class, school, or even music altogether. For these students, who are disproportionately women and minorities, it does not make a difference what others think about the validity of the accusations; their trauma- surviving bodies do not care about separating art and artist. For anyone who continues to use these examples, I ask: is it really worth it?</p>
