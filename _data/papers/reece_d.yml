abstract: |
  <p>Music collections have increased exponentially over the last thirty
  years. From the holdings of museums, libraries, archives, and historic sites
  to the private collections of scholars, collectors, music enthusiasts and
  the casual fan, this movement to preserve, document, and interpret music’s
  existence is driven by a growing interest in its material culture, the
  tangible objects or things that are the material evidence of its creation,
  performance, dissemination, and reception. The musical object as artifact,
  anticipates interpretation and has the power to broaden our understanding of
  music beyond an experiential level. Detached from its original use, these
  objects operate in a broad system of circulation and transmission that
  requires methodologies that focus on the objects themselves, and the
  multiple narratives that have determined their cultural value over time.
  What can we make out of studying music through the lens of its material
  culture? If the material (object) and immaterial (sound/ live performance)
  are seen as co-producers of meaning, the “things” of music are not only a
  reification of music-making, but also serve as triggers for further ideas
  and actions beyond its original use. Situating objects within and outside
  their context of creation elevates their status as symbols of cultural
  values and historical moments, as well as sources of idolization, reverence,
  and personal and collective memories. The multiple ways in which people
  produce and interact with music’s objects form the foundation for the study
  of its material culture. This lecture will use several objects from the
  Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture’s
  music collection to demonstrate how the study of material culture can
  function as a methodological tool and a primary source that offers new
  dimensions for research and interpretation.</p>
