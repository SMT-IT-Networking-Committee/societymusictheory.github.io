abstract: | 
    <p>Leopoldo Miguéz (1850–1902) was a leading figure in Brazil’s Romantic absolute music tradition. As Brazil transitioned from a monarchy to a republic, Miguéz took part in the government’s project of promoting progress expressing the ideals of positivism. This led to a shift in musical aesthetics, away from Italian opera, and toward instrumental music linked to <em>Zukunftsmusik</em> (Andrade 2013). Miguéz composed the first Brazilian symphony, symphonic poem, and violin sonata.</p>
    <p>As Miguéz was probably the first Brazilian composer to use sonata form, this study examines two large-scale movements using Sonata Theory (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006): his piano piece <em>Allegro Appassionato</em> Op. 11 (1883), and the first movement of his violin sonata Op. 14 (1884), contemplating form, harmony, and thematic-motivic construction. It uses two complementary methodologies: “formal-harmonic layered analysis” charts (Almada 2016) and graphical schemes adapted from Kopp’s network diagrams (2002). My study identifies four main characteristics: use of “proto-theme”, the practice of preceding the main theme’s entry by an embryonic version (reference to Janet Schmalfeldt’s concept of <em>becoming</em>); use of <em>roving-harmony passages</em> (Schoenberg 1969), characterized by vagrant chords and a lack of tonal reference; use of non-conventional keys for the secondary group; and a wide spectrum of keys. </p>
    <p>Despite Miguéz’s lack of formal training and an absence of local models, by studying scores, he assimilated the <em>Zeitgeist</em> and struck a balance between norm and deviation, advancing Brazil’s aspirations toward modernization. This study broadens discourses on nineteenth-century sonata-form practices beyond the European repertoires, adding diversity to the canon.</p>
