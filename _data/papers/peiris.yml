title: "Theory and Performance Practice in South Asia: Have Changing Ideas about Meter Influenced How Rhythms are Played?"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>At various moments in the twentieth century, musicologists around the world
  have theorized traditional rhythmic frameworks in terms of latent isochronous
  pulses. These theories have subsequently influenced the ways in which
  musicians have conceptualized rhythmsâ€”particularly rhythms that were
  previously understood through more flexible frameworks. But have these changes
  in conceptualization effected changes in the way rhythms are performed?</p>
  <p>Using percussion music in South Asia as a case study, I analyze historical
  recordings from India and Sri Lanka in order to elucidate how changing ideas
  about meter have been reflected in certain changing performance practices. I
  also analyze newer rhythmic techniques that have been enabled by a conceptual
  shift towards metrical counting. Further, I address the fact that some
  rhythmic performance styles have changed while others have not, and I discuss
  some of the ideological factors that have influenced these phenomena.</p>
  <p>Having drawn attention to the complex ways in which the act of theorizing
  music can interact with traditions of performance practice, I conclude by
  calling for an increased critical awareness regarding the objectives and
  implications of our analytic methods.</p>
