abstract: |
  <p>Throughout the 1920s in Latin America, the voices of indigenous people that
  had been silenced since colonial times started to sound boldly. Ironically,
  however, the voices that emerged during this decade were not those of the
  indigenous peoples themselves, but rather those of the white bourgeois
  intellectuals who started to protest on their behalf, mainly influenced by
  workers’ movements and left-wing ideologies. This new way of positioning the
  indigenous had a profound effect on the arts. </p>
  <p>Current Latin American scholarship emphasizes that the depiction of
  indigenous people during the late Romantic and early modernist periods was
  idealized, anchored in the image of ancient pre-colonial civilizations. In
  works of art music, thus, the indigenous musical elements surfaced as “exotic”
  against prevailing European styles. This trend is known as “Indianism,” in
  contrast with “Indigenism,” in which, according to musicologist Alejandro
  Madrid, composers were able to completely integrate modernist techniques with
  the indigenous elements, especially during the 1930s and 40s.</p>
  <p>I analyze works by two composers representing the first and second
  nationalist generations in Peru: Daniel Alomía Robles’ zarzuela <i>El cóndor
  pasa</i> (1913) and Theodoro Valcárcel’s song collection <i>Cuatro canciones
  incaicas</i> (1930). I demonstrate that, even though Robles and Valcárcel do
  not integrate “exotic” materials seamlessly into European compositional
  frameworks, their music relied on an exoticism of contrasts: the use of
  Quechua language in Valcárcel’s songs and Alomía Robles’s evocation of Incan
  music produce a discourse of social critique that contradicts the idealism of
  nineteenth-century “Indianist” exoticism.</p>
  <p>Against current scholarly approaches that, as Julie Brown points out, adopt
  a deeply critical stance towards discourses on music and race that focus on
  the “Other,” my paper shows how the inclusion of indigenous elements in the
  works of Alomía Robles and Valcárcel succeeded in reconfiguring the “Other” as
  grounds for an inclusive rather than exclusive opposition. This politics of
  “inclusive exclusion,” I argue, offers an alternative theory of the
  marginalization of the exotic “Other” in Latin American modernist music.</p>
