title: "Defying Brevity: Expansion beyond the Phrase Level in Musical Theater"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>A revived enthusiasm for issues of form in classical music by scholars such
  as Caplin, Hepokoski & Darcy, and Schmalfeldt, has stimulated a burgeoning
  interest in popular music’s forms. Musical theater has received comparatively
  little attention. Its formal idiosyncrasies confront us with analytical
  challenges that other repertoires present less obviously. While studies of
  musical theater often mention form within a broader analytical enterprise, one
  issue that has not been thoroughly addressed is the frequent occurrence and
  varied manifestations of formal expansions.</p>
  <p>In this talk, we begin with a question: What is the form of “The Wizard and
  I” in the musical <i>Wicked</i>? We answer by proposing that this AABA number
  is substantially lengthened with a form-level expansion—as opposed to
  phrase-level—which we call a <i>breakthrough section</i>. Breakthroughs are
  initiated with a <i>breakthrough technique</i>. A breakthrough technique
  occurs when a new contrasting section interrupts the closure of the previous
  section. When the contrasting properties of the breakthrough technique
  continue to “spin out” they create a breakthrough section, a form-level
  expansion of the work. After examining breakthroughs in a variety of musicals,
  we conclude by applying these concepts in an analysis of the recurring
  “Unlimited” breakthrough in three numbers from <i>Wicked</i>.</p>
  <p>The way we reimagine expansion in this paper—as a concept that applies at
  levels larger than the phrase—is significant not only for the understanding
  and analysis of musical theater, but also for the many challenges presented in
  other kinds of classical and popular music.</p>
