    <p>Despite the ubiquity of open strings in popular-music guitar performances, fretboard-space models are currently underequipped to address their use—open strings are either ignored or treated as an unreachable fret. This can complicate Cartesian analyses, present additional caveats to fretboard voice leading, and ultimately distances fretboard theory from practice. </p>
    <p>This paper reconceptualizes fretboard space by qualifying open strings as a point of indeterminacy between Lewin’s Generalized Interval System and De Souza’s fret-string network. I argue the entire horizontal vector of the fretboard is activated when a performer articulates an open string. This action simultaneously evokes a single pitch from the GIS from any point in the fret-string network. </p>
    <p>By linking the component universes of fretboard space via open strings, I suggest that open strings are not unlike Lorentzian wormholes—portals that allow one to manipulate time and space to efficiently traverse great distances. Gestural analyses of performances by artists such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Brushy One String, Nancy Wilson, and Kurt Cobain explore how open-string operations mirror the two classes of wormholes. Thin-shell wormholes are infinitely thin and take virtually no time to traverse. Guitarists similarly use adjacent open strings to instantly access otherwise unreachable fretted notes without shifting their left hands. Thick-shell wormholes meanwhile require some distance to traverse, but still mitigate time as a factor of travel. This matches along-string transitions, where guitarists use open-strings to “borrow” time from an open string’s rhythmic value and facilitates otherwise difficult leaps on the horizontal vector of the fretboard.</p>
