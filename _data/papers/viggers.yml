abstract: |
    <p>Although Stravinsky counted <i>Pulcinella</i> (1920) as his “first
    discovery of the past,” scholars have rejected the notion that the galant
    style of <i>Pulcinella</i>’s sources significantly influenced his
    subsequent neoclassical works. In this presentation, I will reveal the
    importance of galant style in shaping Stravinsky’s neoclassical works from
    1920–28, including the Octet, Concerto for Piano and Winds, Piano Sonata,
    Serenade in A, and <i>Apollo</i>.</p>
    <p>My discussion of Stravinsky’s use of galant-era conventions will focus on
    two forms of borrowing. First, Stravinsky’s direct borrowing from specific
    galant works. In the Octet—Stravinsky’s first neoclassical work following
    <i>Pulcinella</i>—I will demonstrate the possibility that Stravinsky returned
    to the works of Domenico Gallo (then attributed to Pergolesi) for material in
    the work’s first movement. Second, I will demonstrate Stravinsky’s use of what
    I call “prototypical galant melodic structure”: a galant-era conventional
    sequence of a tonic-emphasizing opening statement followed by a Prinner
    response—a ubiquitous pattern defined by a descending melodic line of 6^  –5^
    –4^  –3^   above a bass on 4  ^  –3     ^  –2^  –1^     More than 50 percent
    of Pulcinella’s individual movements and each neoclassical work up to
    <i>Apollo</i> feature this structure.</p>
    <p>Stravinsky’s stylistic continuity from <i>Pulcinella</i> to <i>Apollo</i>
    exists not just in his borrowing of galant conventions, but also in his
    compositional techniques. These techniques include his superimposition of
    independent lines, subverted resolution of the conventional stock patterns,
    and modern approaches to modulation and harmonization. The overall analysis
    provides insight into Stravinsky’s approach to composition, the cultural
    aesthetics of the time, and the subtle evolution of his mature neoclassical
    style.</p>
