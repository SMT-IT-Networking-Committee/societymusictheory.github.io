    <p>Jeff Pressing’s original formulation of the referent encompasses many possible structures that undergird musicians’ improvisations, including a theme, motive, mood, image, emotion, or social situation (1984, 346). Importantly, he states that <em>free improvisers</em> create their referent as the performance unfolds (346). Pressing additionally asserts that improvisers vary their “attitudes” to the referent, encompassing imitative, antagonistic, and independent stances (348). Free improvisers therefore continuously modulate their relationships to an unfolding, multifarious, and coauthored referent.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I argue that the concept of affordances, borrowed from ecological psychology, furnishes a compelling analytical embodiment of Pressing’s description. The concept of affordances helps characterize relational qualities between improvisers’ sonic gestures and the unfolding referent. It embraces relations of similarity and contrast, and encompasses connections facilitated both by musical segments’ theoretically defined parts and their “extra-musical” references.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I offer a novel analytical methodology grounded in embodiment and recomposition. By playing along with a recording at the piano, stopping the recording immediately following a decisive juncture, and improvising various continuations, I explore various recomposed responses, ranging from the congruous to the incongruous and referring to multiple sonic and referential characteristics.</p>
    <p>I employ both my ecological framework and embodied-recomposition methodology to discuss excerpts from two performances: “Focus, ThruTime…Time→,” by Muhal Richard Abrams and Fred Anderson, and “Kasumi” by Ingrid Laubrock and Aki Takase. In both cases, the analyses demonstrate my analytical methodology, as well as compelling aspects of these performances.</p>
