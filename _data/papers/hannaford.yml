abstract: |
  <p>For all of the remarkable scholarship on jazz, the subject of interaction
  in collective “free” improvisation remains noticeably under-theorized.
  Benjamin Givan recently suggested that attenuated analytical apertures
  regarding improvised interaction imply a “narrow and homogeneous conception of
  the [jazz] idiom” (2016, [27]). In this paper, I respond to these challenges
  with an analytical framework based on the concept of affordances. My framework
  jettisons delineations of interactive versus non-interactive improvisation.
  Rather, I employ affordances as a metaphor to describe multivalent relations
  between improvisers’ sonic gestures.</p>
  <p>I reference work from ecological psychology, anthropology, and sociology,
  in addition to music theory and musicology, to outline my framework: A
  <i>sonic environment</i> is the conceptual and cognitive frame that
  facilitates musicians’ meaningful interactions. <i>Sonic gestures</i> are
  sounds that improvisers regard as meaningful parts of their sonic environment
  and are delineated in analysis in music-theoretical terms.  <i>Sonic
  characteristics</i> are sonic gestures’ constituent properties that engender
  analytical relations between them. They take two forms: <i>elemental
  characteristics</i> refer to fundamental aspects such as pitch, rhythm,
  texture, timbre, and dynamics, and <i>referential characteristics</i> refer to
  factors such as stylistic conventions, other pieces of music or genres,
  personae, or musicians not present in the performance. Finally, relational
  qualities between sonic gestures range between congruous and incongruous; that
  is, sonic characteristics afford both similar <i>and</i> contrasting responses
  in performance.</p>
  <p>I conclude my paper with some analytical vignettes. These analyses both
  demonstrate the diverse utility of my framework and suggest further
  applications of it.</p>
