title: 'Choosing <i>Musica Ficta</i>: The Modern Tradition of Historically Informed Performance Practice'
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>A performer of medieval music makes performance choices based on
    existing notation and many extra-notational factors. When performers
    investigate a manuscript page to ascertain correct pitches, rhythms, and
    <i>musica ficta</i> practices, they are trying to recreate a historical
    soundscape. For this presentation, I will focus on the choices of
    <i>musica ficta</i> as they alter a “historical soundscape.” I focus on
    fourteenth-century Italian monophonic songs because the considerations for
    <i>musica ficta</i> are purely melodic unless a performer chooses to add a
    contrapuntal line. Sources of Italian monophony also include ample
    <i>ficta</i> signs that are ambiguous in their application and duration.
    Using contrasting recordings of these songs, I will discuss the impact of
    <i>musica ficta</i> choices on the resulting sound world created by
    interpreting the work. In certain recordings, added contrapuntal voices
    complicate and inform <i>musica ficta</i> choices (and vice-versa). I will
    select songs from the Rossi Codex and Squarcialupi Codex, including
    “Lucente Stella” from the Rossi Codex, “De’ poni amor” by Gherardello da
    Firenze, and “Sento d’amor la fiamma” by Lorenzo da Firenze. I will
    provide theoretical substantiation for the inclusion of unwritten <i>ficta
    </i>by engaging with Marchetto da Padova’s treatise, <i>Lucidarium in arte
    musice plane</i>. Ultimately, I will consider the impact of recording
    technology as a form of “early music notation.” The idea of choosing
    <i>ficta</i> to perform or not perform is a product of modern recording
    technology that may lead modern performers and listeners to a more rigid
    understanding of <i>ficta</i> than was historically required.</p>
