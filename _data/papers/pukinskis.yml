abstract: |
    <p>Theorists often endeavor to show the chorale’s relevance to Western
    classical music, but typically stop short of demonstrating how four-part
    writing applies to students’ other musical activities. Given the
    substantial costs associated with four-part writing, it can be a risky
    investment. Failure to connect the topic with non-classroom-based musical
    practice jeopardizes losing the return, leaving students disenchanted and
    discouraged. In this paper, I show how chorale-style writing and analysis
    can be reimagined in a liberal arts program in order to relate to a wider
    array of musical interests. My aim here is not to minimize or abandon the
    utility of the chorale, but rather to repurpose four-part writing for
    application in non-classical styles.</p>
    <p>Through early exploration of rules and departures, I lay groundwork for
    the flexibility that may be asked of students in other theory classrooms,
    performing ensembles, composition, and other creative practice. By the
    time I introduce four-part writing, we have already seen that some of the
    most compelling parts of music come when rules are eschewed or worked
    around, which is particularly relevant to Bach chorales. We discuss how
    different rules apply in different contexts—for students looking to
    improve their performance in an ensemble, arranging for an a capella
    group, or music-directing a staged show, I find conversations such as
    these help them direct their theory work into musical practice. My
    experience has shown that chorale-later architectures invite students from
    diverse backgrounds to engage analytically without being hindered by the
    steep learning curve of chorale-based practices.</p>
