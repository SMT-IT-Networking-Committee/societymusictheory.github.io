abstract: |
  <p>Theodor Adorno’s <i>Philosophie der neuen Musik</i> presents an account of
  modern music in which Schoenberg and Stravinsky are the dialectical extremes.
  Schoenberg represents the progressive pole while Stravinsky is the emblem of
  retrogression. One is tempted to reduce the distinction to that between the
  subjective nature of Expressionism and the regressive objectivism of
  Neoclassicism. Adorno, however, claims that Neoclassicism and Expressionism
  are merely two sides of the same coin. The differentiation in valuation
  between the composers derives not from a stark separation of the subjective
  and the objective, but rather from the perception that Schoenberg comes closer
  in his Expressionist period to striking the proper balance between the
  subjective and the objective. That balance is at the center of Adorno’s theory
  of experience, constructed over the course of his entire career. </p>
  <p>For Adorno, the basis of the objective in music lies in the historical
  tendency of musical material. A composer is obligated to work with the
  material at its current state of development. The material makes demands to
  which the composer must submit. And yet, obviously, the composer can get it
  wrong—or else there would be no proper criterion to distinguish between
  authentic and inauthentic responses to the material. The proper role of the
  subject, however, is much harder to discern. If we are to understand Adorno’s
  championing of Schoenberg over Stravinsky, we must come to grips with Adorno’s
  conception of authentic subjectivity and examine how Adorno brings that
  conception to bear on his reading of Schoenberg’s compositional achievement.
  </p>
  <p>This paper builds on the work of philosophers Brian O’Connor and Robert
  Pippin on subjectivity in Adorno and Lisa Yun Lee’s writings on Adorno and
  corporeality to interrogate Adorno’s vision of an embodied subjectivity as
  exemplified by the Expressionist music of Schoenberg. The condition of the
  modern subject, for Adorno, has deteriorated to the extent that its
  form-providing impulse stutters and becomes incoherent, and yet this very
  incoherence is what allows for the “untransfigured,” direct expression of
  suffering. For a brief moment in Expressionism, music reveals the traumatic,
  corporeal shock that underwrites musical logic. </p>
