    <p>This paper is situated within a debate between Omkarnath Thakur (1897–1967)
    and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande (1860–1936), the two preeminent theorists of
    North Indian classical music in the 20th century. Thakur is known for
    explaining <i>rāga</i>, the central concept of Indian music, in terms of the
    differences between individual <i>rāgas</i>, viz., the distinct
    melodic-motivic patterns, salient pitches, unique guidelines for elaboration,
    etc., which characterize each <i>rāga</i>—an approach that therefore
    emphasizes the surface diversity of <i>rāga</i> music. This approach responds
    to an earlier tradition dating back to medieval India, which understands
    <i>rāgas </i>in terms of their underlying scale structure, and which Thakur
    criticized for ‘reducing’ <i>rāgas</i> to scales, thus robbing them of their
    complexity. Thakur did this in words that mirror, strikingly, similar
    anti-reductionist statements by his European contemporaries (with regard, for
    example, to Schenkerian theory). For this reason, Thakur was unsympathetic
    toward the <i>rāga</i> theory of Bhatkhande, which was influenced by medieval
    modal theory, and which classified all North Indian rāgas into 10 parent
    scales, which he called <i>tḥāṭs</i>. I argue, however, that Thakur
    misunderstood Bhatkhande—through a close reading of the latter’s writings, I
    will contend that Bhatkhande’s “<i>rāga</i> as scale” theory, and the related
    notion of <i>tḥāt </i>(and also “<i>rāganga</i>” and “<i>vādi,</i>” which I
    explore in detail), are not just about <i>rāga</i> structure, but part of a
    generative theory, of how complex <i>rāga</i> phrases arise from deep (scalar)
    backgrounds—which suggests, further, a striking convergence between Indian and
    Western (Schenkerian) descriptions of how musical surfaces are generated.</p>
