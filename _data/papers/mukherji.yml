  <p>“<i>Rāgamālā</i>” literally means “garland” or “braid” of <i>rāga</i>s.
  Metaphorically, however, it denotes the deeper structural and aesthetic
  relationships between <i>rāga</i>s, and learned descriptions of such.
  Therefore, it<i> </i>represents any broader theory of Indian music too, such
  as that proposed by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande—whose less-discussed statements
  about musical cognition and creativity are the focus of this paper. I argue
  that these statements suggest a hitherto-neglected bond between Bhatkhande,
  Humboldt, and Schenker, which has significant implications for the enduring
  interest in <i>music</i>-<i>language </i>connections. Therefore, I begin by
  reviewing a thesis about <i>linguistic</i> creativity, which is said to result
  from our minds’ ability to <i>generate</i> novel, recursively organized
  phrases—a thesis proposed first by the linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt, but
  inherent in Heinrich Schenker’s proposals too, about how composers create
  novel <i>musical</i> pieces. The implication is that Schenker proposed an
  essentially Humboldtian theory of music—but one that connects these thinkers
  to Bhatkhande as well. Bhatkhande’s focus was on analyzing actual <i>rāga
  </i>compositions, to reveal the psychological processes underlying their
  creation. But this made him theorize Indian music, like Schenker and Humboldt,
  in terms of how humans generate recursively organized structures, for example,
  in the way some pitches (like v4 in a <i>rāga</i> like Bihāg) are introduced
  as “dissonances in appropriate places” (Bhatkhande 1909–32, 182) when
  composing <i>rāga </i>phrases. Therefore, as I conclude, weaving a “golden
  braid” between Bhatkhande-Schenker-Humboldt might explain human creativity
  better. But it might also provide a deeper, cross-cultural and historical,
  explanation for the relationship—the eternal <i>rāgamālā</i>—of music and
  language.</p>
