    <p>Like language, music is often believed to refer<i> </i>to external,
    worldly realities. Just as words refer supposedly to thoughts, things, and
    actions, music is said to refer to extra-musical programs, topics, gestures,
    and so on. In this paper, however, I will share a recent proposal, originating
    in mid-20th century philosophical debates, and refined in contemporary
    linguistics, according to which language does not inherently refer to, or
    communicate, anything at all—which therefore rejects the above
    <i>externalist</i> view of language altogether. Instead, this proposal argues
    that meaning in language arises from how a sentence’s surface structure (i.e.
    its “Logical Form”) is generated, through <i>language</i>-<i>internal</i>,
    <i>grammatical</i> procedures. In this light, I will defend a similar,
    <i>internalist</i> attitude to music, which I will do by reconsidering William
    Caplin’s theory of formal functions. Formal functions are beginnings, middles,
    and endings, which, as Caplin has said himself, are a musical piece’s internal
    (or “introversive,” following Agawu) meanings. And as I will illustrate, these
    form-functional meanings depend on how a piece’s surface is generated through
    <i>music-internal</i>, grammatical procedures. This suggests a connection
    between music’s form-functional structure, and linguistic Logical Form. So, I
    will end by discussing a striking implication this has for music theory:
    linguists argue that all languages share a universal grammar, and differ
    only in the varied Logical Forms this grammar generates. Therefore,
    stylistic differences in music could be just (semantic) differences in
    their form-functional structures too, which mask a potentially universal
    musical grammar – suggesting that form-functional theory is a <i>universal
    semantics</i> of music.</p>
