abstract: |
  <p>Patter songs, bravura solo pieces characterized by rapid-fire utterances of
  precise, rhythmically punctuated tongue twisters are commonly associated with
  comic operas, Broadway musicals, and Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and
  provide a show-stopping forum in which to highlight the vocal virtuosity of
  the performers. Yet despite the humorous context, the patter song’s primary
  function is not necessarily to further the comedic narrative, but to be a
  textural and/or pacing contrast to the more lyrical sections of the work. The
  humor comes from the audience’s anticipation of a spectacular verbal meltdown.
  Consequently, patter songs, and their potential for elocutionary disaster,
  have become a perfect target for all manner of music parody. Musical comedians
  such as “Weird Al” Yankovic and The Mighty Boosh have adopted the patter song
  as a vehicle for making fun of vocal acrobatics, but have made modifications
  to highlight the fact that while the repertoire that they parody is replete
  with opportunities for instrumentalists to showcase extreme technical skill,
  there is no equivalent showcase for rock vocalists. By altering the patter
  song’s comedic functionality in simple and stylistic parodies, and turning it
  into a group expression, they are creating a uniquely complex compound
  music/comedy hybrid through which to simultaneously mock the form’s signature
  characteristics and its functional absence within the rock music canon. This
  presentation will examine the evolution of the patter song from an essentially
  non-comedic contrasting device into a multi-faceted comedy tool that comments
  on the nature of virtuosity in rock music.</p>
