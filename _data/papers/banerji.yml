abstract: |
  <p>Alongside consideration of its formal or technical innovations, studies of
  experimental music have increasingly attended to the economic arrangements
  required for producing such projects. At the same time, little attention has
  been paid to the inherent opportunity cost created in the choice to involve
  oneself in the production of experimental music as a performer, composer, or
  organizer. Regardless of one’s role, investing time and energy in such
  projects at least partially excludes the opportunity to earn a more viable
  livelihood from either popular music or other more lucrative non-musical
  labor.</p>
  <p>This paper addresses the impact of the opportunity costs created by popular
  music on the realization of experimental work through a biographical
  ethnography of Brazilian percussionist and composer Nei Sacramento. Born,
  raised, and based in a favela in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Sacramento leads
  several projects which radically re-work the repertoire of Afro-Brazilian
  musical traditions while preserving their basic structures (e.g., melodic
  contour, rhythmic cycles) and thus the Bahian listener’s ability to recognize
  their source despite their recomposition. In experimenting with traditional
  sources as the basis of a black, Brazilian modernism, Sacramento seeks to
  performatively critique the Bahian culture industries’ reduction of musical
  blackness to an accessory for party and pleasure in tourism and nightlife and
  a legacy fundamentally lacking in intellectual sophistication or cultural
  value.</p>
  <p>However, while many musicians in Sacramento’s social network are
  sympathetic to his goals, the inherent challenge of economic survival and
  providing food, water, electricity, and shelter for their families in a favela
  often forces these potential collaborators to choose higher-paying work
  playing popular genres like axé or samba-reggae. Though they possess the
  competence required by his technically demanding compositions, they cannot
  afford the time and money lost in several rehearsals for a low-paying
  performance. Hence this case-study illustrates the cardinal significance of
  the opportunity costs created by the economic landscape of popular music in
  the sociocultural study of experimental artistic projects as well as the
  global inequalities which contribute to the uneven geographic distribution of
  these practices internationally.</p>
