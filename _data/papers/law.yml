abstract: |
  <p>Of the scholars who have recently published on pantomime and
  ballet-pantomime (Waeber, Nye, Burden and Thorp, Brown, Harris-Warrick,
  Didier), Béatrice Didier related pantomime to the notion of freedom (2016). Her
  suggestive remark notwithstanding, scholars have yet to explain how freedom is
  manifested in specific operas or ballet-pantomimes and how the freedom in and
  of pantomime enacted the Enlightenment quest for freedom in pre-Revolutionary
  France. Building upon the work of John Rice, I demonstrate in this paper how
  Salieri used pantomime to imagine a freedom of action as a kinetic-cognitive
  form of negative freedom. </p>
  <p>I begin by showing how Noverre theorizes the idea of freedom of motion in
  <i>Lettres sur la danse</i> (1760) and put this idea onstage in his
  ballet-pantomime <i>Apelles et Campaspe</i> (Paris, 1776). There the painter
  Apelles’s involuntary bodily expressions enact freedom of motion, a freedom
  from bodily control that lures Alexander the Great’s mistress—the dancer
  Campaspe—away from the monarch toward the painter. Freedom of motion was
  imagined as contagious, rippling outward from Apelles to Campaspe and providing
  a kinetic-spatial basis for illegitimate love. Their affair reifies a freedom
  of action that undercuts monarchical authority as much as empowering artists,
  painters, and dancers. Like Noverre, Du Roullet and Salieri reworked
  Metastasio’s <i>Ipermestra</i> (1744) in light of Noverre’s <i>Hypermnestre</i>
  (1764) and Calzabigi’s <i>Ipermestra</i> (1783), staging the opera <i>Les
  Danaïdes</i> (1784) that reinforces the correlation between the bodily and
  sociopolitical freedoms in pantomime. They grant Hypermnestre an advanced
  cognitive faculty of reflection while casting her sisters—the Danaïdes—as
  subhuman murderers unable to refrain from committing mass mariticide. They
  imagined a freedom of action grounded in cognitive control over what Condillac
  identifies in <i>Traité des animaux</i> (1755) as animalistic impulses. </p>
  <p>The intertwined bodily and cognitive elements in <i>Les Danaïdes</i>
  disclose that the combination of the embodied concept of freedom of motion and
  cognitive faculty of reflection builds the foundation for freedom of action.
  This kinetic-cognitive foundation, theorized by Diderot and Condillac, made
  pantomime a medium through which freedom in d’Alembert’s <i>De la liberté de la
  musique</i>(1759) was reinterpreted in pre-Revolutionary France as human
  agency. </p>
