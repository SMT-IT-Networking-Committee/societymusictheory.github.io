    <p>The belief is widespread amongst modern scholars and practicing musicians that the pervasive flexibility of tempo heard on early recordings constitutes a “liberty” of Romantic performance practice, originating with Wagner and Liszt (Rosenblum 1994) and unforeseen by earlier composers (Bowen 1993). This view, however, sits at odds with an abundance of sources from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (Brown 2004), which demonstrate not only that such rubato predated Wagner by several decades, but that composers even <em>expected</em> the tempo to fluctuate in certain well-defined situations, which I enumerate. Working from these expectations, I argue, composers <em>wrote</em> <em>tempo fluctuations into their music</em> through the notes they chose, in striking alignment with their formal layouts.</p>
    <p>Building on work by Philip (1992), I show that the rubato described in early nineteenth-century treatises is exemplified in pre-WWII orchestral recordings (where tempo practices are clearer than in solo or chamber music), using tapping data I collected from ~350 recordings of around 40 Classical and Romantic sonata movements. And I note ways in which the familiar features of sonata form might encode changes in tempo, identifying the norms of typical sonata-form tempo design and passages that flout these customs.</p>
    <p>These conclusions require us to expand our notions about what constitutes form. If the tempo practices on early recordings indeed have their roots in the early nineteenth century, then they are as much a part of the music’s form as its harmonies and phrase structures. In other words, I consider tempo a form-defining parameter.</p>
