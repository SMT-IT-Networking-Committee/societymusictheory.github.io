    <p>This paper formulates a transpositional combinational (TC) based
    theoretical model for analyzing the harmonic and formal structure of <i>sur
    incises</i> (1996, 1998) for three pianos and percussion by Pierre Boulez.
    The theory extends the TC model of Boulez’s pitch-class multiplication
    operation developed by Ciro Scotto (2014) into new territory, and the paper
    demonstrates the analytical advantages of a TC based theory compared to the
    theories of pcset multiplication formulated by Catherine Losada (2008,
    2014), Stephen Heinemann (1998), and Lev Koblyakov (1990). The TC based
    theory introduces the concept of hexachordal mutation, which transforms one
    hexachordal set-class (SC) into a member of a different SC. Hexachordal
    mutations form a transformational network with the contextual transposition
    operation J that relates harmonic complexes of hexachords generated by TC.
    The union of transformationally related mutated hexachords produces pcset
    chains that generate, organize, and interrelate much of the pcset material
    with cardinalities greater than six in <i>sur incises</i>. Since pcset
    chains and their corresponding TC-transformational network organize and
    interrelate hexachords from different SCs rather than just
    transformationally relating the members of a single SC, the theoretical
    model extends the pentachordal network and contextual operations David Lewin
    (1993) developed for analyzing Stockhausen’s <i>Klavierstück</i> III.</p>
