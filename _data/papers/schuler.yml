title: "The Harmonic Language of Black Minstrel Music by Jacob J. Sawyer (1856-1885)"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>For James M. Trotter’s famous book <i>Music and Some Highly Musical
  People</i> (Boston, 1880), only thirteen pieces of music were selected for
  inclusion. One of these pieces was by African American composer Jacob J.
  Sawyer. The inclusion marks Sawyer as an exemplary and well-known composer,
  despite his young age at the time. His early death from tuberculosis let him
  sink into oblivion. Until recently, little was known about Sawyer. A very
  sketchy and erroneous biography was published in E. Southern’s <i>Biographical
  Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians</i> (Westport, Conn., 1982).
  The author of this poster recently discovered Sawyer’s birth and death records
  as well as numerous newspaper articles from the late 1870s and early 1880s
  that provide biographical information and information about Sawyer’s work as a
  musician and composer. This poster will display some of the discovered
  artifacts, a biography, and will focus on Sawyer’s collaborative work with
  famous musicians of his time and on his leadership in well-known Black
  Minstrel ensembles of the time. In addition, this poster will start
  discussing, for the first time, Sawyer’s Minstrel music, specifically
  providing an analytical score of his composition <i>I’m de Captain of the
  Black Cadets</i> for voice and piano (1881), in which the lyrics are supported
  by the rhythmic and melodic design. As with many other of Sawyer’s
  compositions, his otherwise “simple” entertainment music is built on an
  intriguingly creative harmonic language that is characterized by the used of
  common-tone diminished-seventh chords, augmented-sixth chords, added-note
  chords, and a walking bass.</p>
