    <p>I am not the first to note that music, and music theory, are highly skill-based discourses. As such, music can quickly exclude those who are “different,” construed here in terms of race, class, gender, bodily or cognitive ability, or some combination. This paper opens space for us to reconsider what we are doing when we are teaching music (theory) and more specifically, to consider teaching in a way that is more socially-based than skill-based. I share about “Music Sociality,” a middle-school program I facilitate at City Elementary (a Chicago school for children with autism and other sensory-processing or learning differences). The program aims to build students’ descriptive vocabulary and reciprocal communication about sound, thereby increasing social conduits, via music, between neuro-atypical kids and their (neuro-typical) peers. This program creates social connection around music, rather than teaching skill, technique, or specific knowledge. Recognizing that this is a middle school program, and that I teach music at a privileged University that values liberal-arts-style inquiry, I nevertheless think out loud and share tools for transporting the aims of “Music Sociality” into your contexts and your college music theory classrooms. This is an invitation to take creative, pragmatic, and specific steps toward reframing music, and your music (theory) teaching, as a space of shared sociality and inclusion, rather than as a space of epistemic exclusion.</p>
