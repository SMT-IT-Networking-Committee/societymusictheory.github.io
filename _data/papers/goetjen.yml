title: "Through the Fire of Imagination: The Keyboard Sketch as Mediator Between Improvisation and Composition"

abstract: |
  <p>The role of keyboard improvisation in the creative process of
  late-eighteenth-century composers has long been recognized. Anecdotal evidence
  shows that generating ideas by improvising [<i>phantasiren</i>] at a keyboard
  instrument was an integral part of the compositional process. Mozart stated
  that he preferred to have a keyboard instrument next to his writing desk, and
  the biography of Haydn by his friend Georg August Griesinger states
  unequivocally that “Haydn always devised his works at the keyboard.”</p>
  <p>Still unexplored, however, is the role that composers’ sketches played in
  the transference of improvised ideas to compositions in their final forms. The
  eighteenth-century theorist Johann Georg Sulzer offered a window into this
  process by framing sketches as a liminal stage, mediating between the “fire”
  of improvisation and the finished work. As he wrote, “sketches, when they are
  by the great masters, are often more highly prized than works more completely
  realized, for all the fire of imagination, often dissipated in the execution
  of the work, is to be met in them.” This creative fire, present in the act of
  improvisation, burns its mark onto the sketching page, and it awaits
  reigniting through the craft of composition.</p>
  <p>Examining sketches of works by Haydn and Mozart in keyboard (two-staff)
  format, I argue that keyboard technique and the physical nature of the
  instrument may be discerned in sketches and traced through the act of each
  composition. I show, moreover, that the impact of improvising and keyboard
  sketching on composition was not limited to works by keyboard virtuosi such as
  Mozart. The keyboard sketch serves as a mediating device through which even
  non-keyboard works took shape.</p>
