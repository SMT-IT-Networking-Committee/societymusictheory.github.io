abstract: |
  <p>The Devotio Moderna movement stood at the center of religious life in
  fifteenth-century Europe, yet its music has remained on the periphery of
  musicological scholarship. The plainchant style of much Devotio Moderna song
  seems like a holdover from earlier centuries and does not fit into narratives
  that prize stylistic ingenuity and singular composers. Through surviving
  Devotio Moderna songbooks, we confront instead the musical creativity of
  non-professional musicians, who compiled and adapted songs in simple idioms to
  create personal collections focused on devotional efficacy.</p>
  <p>This paper examines one Devotio Moderna songbook, Wien 12875, a collection
  of Dutch and Latin monophonic songs from the late fifteenth century. Its
  compiler selectively gathered new and pre-existent songs into one manuscript,
  freely combining liturgical and paraliturgical items to reflect specific
  devotional interests. This process relates to the Devotio Moderna approach to
  devotional prose, in which adherents produced personally meaningful
  collections called <i>rapiaria</i> by copying pre-existent materials. The
  compilation of pre-existent songs is a common but often overlooked means of
  creative engagement with music.</p>
  <p>In Wien 12875, the writer also constructed individual songs by adapting
  liturgical music. Three songs—<i>Ave maria ave venerabilis</i>, <i>Gaude gaude
  o turtur</i>, and <i>Media vita in morte sumus</i>—display variations on this
  process. <i>Ave maria</i>, found only in Wien, stitches together a unique
  Marian text from a series of Marian appellations. Its music draws heavily on
  the <i>Salve regina</i>, but also on other liturgical sources, creating a
  pastiche melody. <i>Gaude gaude o turtur</i>, a meditation on holiness and
  humility, turns a Matins responsory into an extended paraliturgical
  contrafact. The Lenten antiphon <i>Media vita in morte sumus</i> here includes
  added interjections set to melodies from a plainchant Mass Ordinary. These
  three songs display a process of songwriting that adapts long-standing
  liturgical chant repertories to create personally meaningful devotional songs.
  Wien 12875 thus reveals, through both its compilation of pre-existent songs
  and making of new songs through adaptation, how musical creativity is not
  limited to originality of compositional style. It underscores the ongoing,
  significant cultural and devotional role of simple musical idioms in the
  fifteenth century.</p>
