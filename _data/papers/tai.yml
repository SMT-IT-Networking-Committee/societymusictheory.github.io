    <p>Dancers use rhythmic and metric concepts differently from musicians, and these concepts are often ill-defined in dance-music research. Henri Bergson’s philosophy of time, memory, and movement provides a gateway for more nuanced explanations of rhythmic and metric concepts in dance-music analysis. In dance, it forms the philosophical basis for much recent research, as is reflected in how dancers describe their visual and physical experience of rhythm and meter. In music, it has inspired Christopher Hasty’s and Victor Zuckerkandl’s rhythmic and metric theories based on motion and processual experience.</p>
    <p>Building on Hasty and Zuckerkandl, this paper first frames rhythm and meter in twentieth-century dance writings in Bergsonian terms. A dance step does not have a discrete beginning or ending, and encompasses memories and potentials, for the body’s position is both the result of the previous movement and the preparation for the next. As such, the dancer’s view of rhythm and meter can be conceptualized as Bergson’s <em>durée</em>: a continuous flow of states that melt into one another with indeterminate boundaries, as memory prolongs itself into the present and becomes potential for the future. The paper then uses <em>durée</em> to explicate rhythmic and metric concepts in dance-music analysis, such as accent, phrase, and durational unit, and applies them to an analysis of <em>A Sweet Spell of Oblivion</em> choreographed by David Dawson. A Bergsonian understanding of these concepts reveals subtleties in choreography that might otherwise escape notice, and enriches musicians with a visual and kinesthetic understanding of Hasty’s and Zuckerkandl’s theories.</p>
