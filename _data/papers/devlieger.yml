title: "Searching for Similarity: Confirmation Bias in Partisan Forensic Musicology"
abstract: |
    <p>Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century, regulations on expert testimony have sought to minimize the impact of disagreeing experts. Yet, as seen in recent cases like <em>Williams v. Gaye</em> (2018), <em>Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin</em> (2018), and <em>Gray v. Perry</em> (2019), disagreements between forensic musicologists still play a large role in contemporary music copyright decisions. This paper suggests that the disagreement between partisan experts is due, in part, to confirmation bias rather than ethical or financial allegiance. Confirmation bias is defined as “a cognitive tendency to search for and evaluate information in ways that are partial to an already formed hypothesis” (Lidén, Gräns, &amp; Juslin 2018). It has been observed in fields such as cognitive psychology (Rajsic, Pratt, &amp; Wilson 2015), economics (Charness &amp; Dave 2017), legal studies (Lindén et al. 2018), and forensic science (Moser 2013). Investigating confirmation bias in music analysis can shed light on challenges in both forensic musicology and the broader field of music scholarship. </p>
    <p>Because music analysis is a subjective act rather than an objective one, there is certainly risk for confirmation bias in forensic musicology. An expert hired by a plaintiff, or the party alleging copyright infringement, may start their analyses by searching for similarities between two works. For example, during her deposition in <em>Williams v. Gaye</em> (2018), expert witness Judith Finell explained her analytical methodology: “I listen to the two recordings and determine what if anything sounds related and similar between them, and if I identify certain elements then I usually have to provide a transcription of those particular elements or portions of the music. And then I compare those transcriptions” (Finell deposition 2014). On the other hand, an expert retained by the defendant, or the party denying infringement, may start their analysis by searching for differences. Given the multiple musical components present in even the “simplest” musical work, both starting points will lead to valid observations about the work, allowing for expert disagreement. This paper proposes that appointing a panel of third-party musicologists to conduct forensic analyses from a neutral starting point could minimize the effect of confirmation bias in such cases. </p>
