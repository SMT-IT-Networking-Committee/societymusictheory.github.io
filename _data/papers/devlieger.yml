title: "The Bias of Western Musical Notation in Music Copyright Litigation"

abstract: |
    <p>In music copyright law, it has been asserted that music is a
    quantifiable object and that music analysis is an objective act. However,
    because musical arguments lack falsifiability, music analysis is instead a
    subjective, interpretive act. Inherent in interpretive analytical
    decisions are value judgments about what is worth analyzing and what
    methods should be used. Because our analysis techniques are rooted in
    Western art music, these decisions often prioritize melody and harmony.
    Consequently, these musical features are prioritized by American copyright
    law. While melody and harmony are considered valuable musical features
    worthy of copyright protection, musical features that are important to
    other musical traditions are devalued.</p>
    <p>This paper investigates the ways that different musical features are valued
    or devalued in music copyright law by suggesting that the continued use of
    Western musical notation in the courtroom has played a substantial role in
    perpetuating the prioritization of so-called “primary” musical features and
    the devaluing of “secondary” ones. In addition to prioritizing certain musical
    features over others, staff notation can alienate or sway the jury of “lay
    listeners” often required in music copyright cases.</p>
    <p>The decisions made in music copyright cases contribute to the power
    dynamics at play in the music industry: deciding who can create what, how
    something can be created, and who deserves credit for the creation. Since
    music copyright cases can have a tangible effect on the creation of
    popular music, it is crucial that we as music scholars interrogate and
    address the biases inherent in music copyright law.</p>
