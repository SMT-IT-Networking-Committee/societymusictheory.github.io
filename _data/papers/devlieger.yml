abstract: |
  <p>Recent high-profile music copyright cases have shed light on problematic
  music analysis techniques utilized in litigation. These questionable uses of
  music analysis are the result of a combination of issues including limits
  placed on expert witness testimony, the lay listener test, and the separate
  copyrights for a song and its recording. Perhaps the biggest issue, however,
  is the absence of clear guidelines stipulating what musical features are
  copyrightable and what constitutes substantial similarity. This allows experts
  to ignore questions of intertextuality and stylistic allusion in popular music
  (Moore 2012; Burkholder 1994), focusing instead on contrived investigations of
  “disguised infringement” and misapplications of reductive analytical
  techniques (Finell 2008; Avsec 2004). </p>
  <p>Music copyright law has reached a point where stylistic allusion and
  intertextual references can be regarded as instances of musical plagiarism, a
  fact that threatens the very creativity that copyright law was intended to
  protect. This paper demonstrates that the evolution of music copyright law in
  the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has created a need to redefine
  similarity in recorded popular song. It concludes that the failure to address
  concepts of intertextuality and stylistic allusion, combined with poor music
  analysis presented in the courtroom, has a tangible and exclusionary effect on
  the creation of popular music. In order to promote musical creativity in a
  fair and equal way, music scholars need to rethink the ways that we talk about
  similarity in different contexts. </p>
