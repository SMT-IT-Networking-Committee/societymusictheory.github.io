  <p>Alarmed by rising costs and aging audiences, orchestra directors are
  increasingly turning to mass culture to fill seats and shore up financial
  gaps. Enter the rise of the cine-concert: an orchestral event in which a
  symphony orchestra performs an underscore (and occasionally source music) in
  synchronization with the projected film. While dialogue and sound effects
  remain pre-recorded, auditor-spectators experience the film’s music live. In
  this way, the cine-concerts experience something akin to film’s “silent” past,
  when prestige orchestras accompanied major studio pictures in lavish movie
  palaces across the country. In an ironic twist, contemporary digital
  technologies such as Pro Tools enable technicians to meticulously separate
  soundtrack elements for this purpose; it is twenty-first-century technology
  that makes the cine-concert’s nostalgic turn possible. This fragmentation of
  the mise-en-bande threatens to disrupt the posited unity of cinema and
  destabilizes the soundtrack hierarchy, which generally privileges dialogue
  over music. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I explore the theoretical and cultural implications of these
  cine-concerts. I examine liveness and media in academic discourse, centering
  on (but not limiting to) Walter Benjamin’s theory of art, reproduction, and
  aura. Cine-concerts, like Benjamin’s mechanical reproductions, crave the
  replication of aura, and these events manipulate sound and space as a means of
  re-vivifying pre-recorded audio-visual material. Live musical accompaniment,
  however, endows the cine-concert with an aura that is adroitly commodified.
  Cine-concerts combine mass distribution with singular performances, albeit
  ones that often strive to recreate the recording. In this, the cine-concert
  overturns theories of mechanical and live reproduction as they have been
  historically understood. Via liveness, mechanical reproductions (films)
  acquire aura. </p>
  <p>Performances guided by David Newman and Ludwig Wicki underline this
  aesthetic tension at the core of the cine-concert. Newman, a longtime
  Hollywood musician, composer, and conductor replicates the original soundtrack
  recording as closely as possible, performing under the dialogue track.
  Alternatively, the Lucerne-based Wicki frequently allows his orchestra to
  dominate the live mix, occasionally overwhelming dialogue and effects. A
  comparison between Newman and Wicki’s performances with the Philadelphia
  Orchestra illuminate the notion that the cine-concert is at once both a
  mediated recording and live performance imbued with aura. </p>
