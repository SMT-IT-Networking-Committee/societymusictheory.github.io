    <p>Experimental music has a problem with voice. And the voices of
    experimental music—whether singing, speaking, or composing—seem to have a
    problem with agency. In this paper, I revisit Edward T. Cone’s notion of
    “the composer’s voice,” Seth Monahan’s theory of anthropomorphic
    agent-classes in analytical discourse, and recent work on performer agency
    by Rolfe Inge Godøy and Tami Gadir to explore how experimental music’s
    problems with voice and with agency are variously amplified or silenced by
    analytical method, sound recording technology, and culturally-specific
    listening practices.</p>
    <p>Post-1945, composers of experimental music sought alternatives to
    received conventions of personal expression and agency in the composition
    and performance of their musical works. In <i>It’s Gonna Rain</i> (1965)
    and <i>Come Out</i> (1966), for example, Steve Reich claimed to break from
    these conventions by reconceptualizing musical sound as a product of
    recorded speech and a semi-autonomous compositional process. Through
    extensions to Monahan’s meta-analytical model, I show how the composer’s
    agential norms persisted in these tape works, and I suggest that this
    persistence is made especially evident by the voices of Reich’s unwitting
    “performers,” Brother Walter and Daniel Hamm. I argue that these tape
    works engender a hermeneutics of minimal music driven by the
    technomorphization of human performance rather than the
    anthropomorphization of perceived musical agents. This technomorphic
    hermeneutics is, however, contingent upon what Marie Thompson calls “white
    aurality,” a set of unmarked listening practices and musical ontologies
    which conveniently obscure the voices and agents with which experimental
    music seems to have a problem.</p>
