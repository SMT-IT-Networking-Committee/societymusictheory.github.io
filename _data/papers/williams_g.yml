title: "Shellac, Colonial Ecology and Haptic Desire in Early Recorded Sound"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Shellac was a vital material for early recorded sound: it sustained
  proliferating record markets and novel listening scenarios throughout the
  first half of the twentieth century. The material is enduring and remains
  conspicuous, both audibly and tangibly; its sheer mass bows the shelves of
  sound archives worldwide. However, shellac’s role in music history has gone
  largely unremarked (with the notable exception of Jacob Smith’s recent
  <i>Eco-Sonic Media</i>). It has been similarly eschewed by material
  historians, who have favored comparable, though even more extensively used
  commodities such as rubber and plastics. This paper thus has twin aims. First,
  it contributes to recovering shellac’s history, which, I argue, casts unusual
  light on globalization and colonial modes of production. Second, I consider
  ways in which materials of recorded sound—shellac, wax, and vinyl
  especially—might, more broadly, matter.</p>
  <p>I focus on the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, a time of
  intense scientific interest in shellac pioneered by Indian and colonial
  botanists and entymologists. Shellac is the resinous secretion of lac bugs
  found mainly in the forests of north-east India; its cultivation depended on a
  cottage industry of farmers and inter-regional and indentured laborers, as
  well as unpredictable crop yields due to weather and parasites. I track
  colonial efforts to tame forest ecologies alongside labor politics, including
  anti-colonial forces that attached hope of national independence to the
  country’s shellac monopoly. Such political overtones remained largely
  inaudible to gramophone listeners. However, experiences of recorded music far
  removed from India remained palpably linked to broader colonial dynamics that
  made shellac a desirable and futuristic material. </p>
  <p>By considering everyday practices of gramophone records—buying, playing,
  cleaning, and recycling—in Britain and the US, I show that markets for shellac
  discs were fueled by haptic desire: a wish to handle sound as manifest in a
  cutting-edge bioplastic. This argument provides insight into recorded music as
  a colonial phenomenon, as described, famously, by Steven Feld, and, more
  recently, by Michael Denning. It also redescribes Jonathan Sterne’s
  much-discussed notion of audile technique, situating anglophone histories of
  sound reproduction within intimate practices deeply imbricated within early
  multinational capitalism and colonial environmental ecology.</p>
