abstract: |
  <p>The field of fifteenth- to seventeenth-century Spanish plainchant
  manuscripts has been relatively unstudied, chiefly due to the Spanish
  government’s suppression, beginning in 1935, of Spain’s monasteries and
  convents, which in turn led to the widespread dispersal of the liturgical
  books owned by those religious institutions. Many of those manuscripts found
  their ways to the United States, but, usually stripped of all identifying
  features, making it nearly impossible to determine their provenance. While a
  few scholars have begun studying the manuscripts that survived in Spain, until
  recently there has been little work on those that now reside in the United
  States. One such source is University of Denver Library, Special Collections,
  MS M 2147 XVI .M1, a sixteenth-century Spanish manuscript of unknown
  provenance. In fact, almost nothing is known about “Willcox 1” beyond the name
  of its donor.</p>
  <p>Despite the lack of any identifying marks of ownership or even general
  provenance, a careful examination of the manuscript’s construction, decorative
  art work, scribal hands, and liturgical contents reveals much about the
  origins and use of Willcox 1. The manuscript’s Spanish/Iberian origins are
  evident from its Moorish, mudéjar-style decoration, and its general contents
  are those of an antiphoner, a liturgical office book containing material for
  the Sanctorale, or Catholic saints venerated throughout the Church year. More
  specifically, the saints celebrated in Willcox 1 are consistent with those
  venerated by the Order of Preachers (Dominican Order), a point confirmed by a
  small Dominican heraldic symbol on the manuscript’s opening folio. A close
  study of Willcox 1’s pen work and especially its decorative initials shows
  that the manuscript was created in three separate phases, and one of the main
  scribes for the second phase was a woman, “Mata M.,” who “signed” her work
  within several strapwork initials. Finally, the incomplete contents of Willcox
  1 suggest that it was almost certainly the first of a pair of antiphoners. A
  search through numerous similar Spanish manuscripts in US collections suggests
  that the orphaned single leaf at Yale University (Beinecke Library MS 485.3)
  may be all that survives of Willcox 1’s companion manuscript. </p>
