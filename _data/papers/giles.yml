abstract: |
  <p>The verb <i>rappresentare</i> appears frequently in early modern books on
  theatre, literature, and music, despite being uniquely elusive: how exactly
  does one “represent” something with gestures, words, or tones? Why do the
  “representations” of this period seem to have an uneasy relationship with
  “truth” in their preference for a stylized “false”? What can this tell us about
  the history of music as “language” or even as “image”? The concept of
  representation in early-seventeenth-century Italy was central to early-baroque
  understandings of the intersections between the arts—<i>rappresentare</i> was
  as much a practical concern as much as it was an aesthetic one. The so-called
  <i>stile rappresentativo</i> (theatrical style) was first proposed by Vincenzo
  Galilei (d. 1591) to define a new way of representing a text in the most vivid
  way, that is, through music. Though typically associated with the recitative
  style and thus linked with opera, the <i>stile rappresentativo</i> was also
  used in concertato madrigals not meant as theatre music. But the variety of
  types of poetry, performing contexts, and, indeed, musical styles associated
  with the <i>stile rappresentativo</i> makes it impossible to define it as
  musical “style,” at least in the modern sense of the word.</p>
  <p>There is no scholarly consensus about what is actually being “represented”
  in the <i>stile rappresentativo</i>, and contemporary theorists—most notably
  the Florentine Giovanni Battista Doni (1593–1647)—could not give this concept
  clear stylistic parameters. Still, writers and musicians, including Claudio
  Monteverdi (1567–1643), felt the need to distinguish music in <i>stile
  rappresentativo</i>, insisting that it had the power to represent <i>al
  vivo</i> characters, situations, or affects. This paper proposes that the
  <i>stile rappresentativo</i> cannot be defined by musical characteristics
  alone; it was understood as an exceptional union of stylistic idioms from three
  different art forms: music, literature, and theatre. The words chosen by early
  modern writers and, by extension, the words we use among ourselves to consider
  how something can be “represented” in a painting, a sculpture, or a piece of
  music, cannot be separated either from artistic creation or experience; in
  other words, the art of describing style shapes not only what things mean, but
  what they are.</p>
