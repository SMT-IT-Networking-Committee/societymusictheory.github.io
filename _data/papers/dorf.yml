abstract: |
  <p>The arch of Palmyra stood in modern-day Syria for over 1800 years until the
  Islamic State (Daesh) destroyed the remaining traces of the Roman monument in
  early October 2015. The loss of the UNESCO World Heritage Site elicited
  world-wide condemnation, but also calls to reconstruct the ruins to their
  former ruined glory. In April 2016, Oxford’s Institute for Digital Archaeology
  in collaboration with an international team of researchers and artisans
  unveiled a reconstruction of the famed arch in London’s Trafalgar Square. The
  ceremony included speeches by dignitaries, but also a performance by
  singer/songwriter Stef Conner and harpist/arcaheologist Andy Lowings of
  excerpts from their 2014 album <i>The Flood</i>. Connor and Lowings’ music
  sets the 4000-year-old Sumerian text of the Epic of Gilgamesh in a
  contemporary setting blending jazz and Arabic classical music to the
  accompaniment of a reconstructed 4500-year-old Lyre of Ur. The creators of
  <i>The Flood</i> do not claim to faithfully reconstruct long lost melodies:
  these are new works. The reconstructed arch, on the other hand, does claim
  near perfect fidelity to the lost original. “My intention,” declared Roger
  Michels, project director and chief benefactor, “is to show Islamic State
  that anything they can blow up we can rebuild exactly as it was before, and
  rebuild it again and again.” Music, of course, follows different rules, but
  neither audiences nor organizers of the Palmyra ceremony seemed to mind the
  geographic, temporal, or stylistic dissonances between arch and music.</p>
  <p>This juxtaposition of the faithful and unfaithful reconstructions of Levant
  culture not only provides a setting to test the limits of musical
  reconstructions, refabrications and reinventions, but also demonstrates ways
  musical reconstructions function as a form of public musicology. My paper
  examines Conner’s neo-Sumerian music (structure, borrowings) and the
  reconstruction and performance of Mesopotamian lyres in light of recent
  scholarship in digital archaeology and reperformance in Performance Studies.
  Such public performances, I argue, sidestep scholarly questions of
  authenticity and allows us to see how, when, and to whom scholarship becomes
  “real” to publics. </p>
