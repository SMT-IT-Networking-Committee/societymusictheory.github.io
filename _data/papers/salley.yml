title: "The Schemata of Jazzâ€™s Standard Repertoire: A Preliminary Study"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>This presentation discusses schemata in standard jazz, surveying
    compositions by jazz musicians and songwriters from America and Europe after
    1925. Understanding schemata as confluences of musical features that create
    recognizable, stylistically expressive constructs, it acknowledges a range
    of features including harmony (including chord quality and root
    relationship), hypermetric strength, formal position/function, and melody.
    Schemata are especially relevant to jazz scholarship, given the limited
    number of chord types, the ubiquity of II-V and II-V-I progressions, the
    small number of conventional song forms, and the rigidity of hypermeter in
    this standard repertory. This presentation concludes by addressing the
    applicability of schema theory to jazz arranging, composition, performance,
    and pedagogy. </p>
