abstract: |
    <p>I have my own story: I am an ambiguous minority (basically I call myself a white Hispanic, never mind my indigenous ancestry). I am a very late return to academia (PhD 2013 when I turned 60), AND I am a survivor of the World Trade Center on 9/11, with significant PTSD.</p>
    <p>I am honored and challenged as an adjunct at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, where the enrolled student population is 47.8% Hispanic or Latino, 18.7% White, 17.7% Black or African American, 10.4% Asian, 1.59% Two or More Races, 0.351% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.263% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders. Of these students, many are coming from socio-economically difficult circumstance, with far more challenges than middle-class students in residential colleges. The issues are: how do I nurture my students, and help them move forward? How do I use teaching of gen-ed classes in music appreciation and world music survey to present a de-colonized, anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-ableist curriculum that engages and inspires my students, and allows them to integrate what they learn from me into their larger weltanschauung? At the same time, how do I not hurt myself through constant triggering of PTSD as I deal with real-life issues ranging from slavery to the Holocaust?</p>
