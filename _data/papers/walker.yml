abstract: |
  <p>In 1896, Pope Leo XIII composed a Latin ode that commemorated the baptism
  of Clovis at Reims in 496 CE and, by extension, the birth of Catholic France.
  This foundational myth was so deeply entrenched in French nation building that
  an anonymous writer boldly claimed during the celebrations that “when Jesus
  died, he did not look to Jerusalem—he looked to France.”</p>
  <p>That same ode fostered an unlikely collaboration between Leo XIII and the
  Director of the Paris Conservatoire, Théodore Dubois, the musical mouthpiece
  for the Republic, who set it to music as an oratorio titled <i>Le Baptême de
  Clovis</i> (The Baptism of Clovis). After its successful premiere at the
  cathedral of Reims in 1899, the oratorio was chosen to represent the best of
  French music at the 1900 Exposition Universelle de Paris as part of the
  official concerts sponsored by the Republican government at the Trocadéro.
  Parisian critics across the political, religious, and aesthetic spectrum
  joined together in proclaiming the performance a triumph for France. </p>
  <p><i>Le Baptême de Clovis</i> and its reception thus provide a striking
  counter example to the still prevailing historiographic trope that, according
  to historian Ralph Gibson, Republicans and Catholics “could not stand each
  other in the nineteenth century.” Moreover, Dubois’s oratorio was not an
  isolated case. As I argue in this paper, this and other similar works show how
  the supposedly secular French Third Republic instrumentalized musical
  composition and performance as a tool to reconfigure and transform French
  Catholicism into an indispensable aspect of Republican French identity.
  Whereas the political connotations of Clovis’s conversion were made explicit
  at Reims—the nation’s “cradle of faith”—they took on a different meaning at
  the blatantly Republican Trocadéro. Drawing on unpublished correspondence and
  archival materials as well as the Parisian press response, I challenge the
  prevalent view that posits French Republicanism and Catholicism as mutually
  exclusive world views. I propose instead a new epistemological model for
  conceptualizing a <i>fin-de-siècle</i> Republican identity that was at once
  founded on Republican ideology and the heritage of the Catholic Church.</p>
