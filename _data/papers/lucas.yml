abstract: |
    <p>The music of the Swedish death metal band Meshuggah is known for
    combining a rigid 4/4-based song structure with looping riffs in a variety
    of meters. Some riffs, however, further complicate this structure by
    seeming to begin <i>in media res</i>. In this paper, focusing on two songs
    from the 2008 album <i>obZen</i>, I examine this previously overlooked
    compositional technique in which rhythmic patterns can only be heard to
    cohere retrospectively and with repetition.</p>

    <p>In my analyses, I move between conventional transcriptions and
    spectrograms, with an eye (and ear) toward questioning what each can tell
    us about musical events. In studying Meshuggah’s music, spectrograms open
    up a revealing perspective on rhythmic structures, particularly with
    regard to visualizing event onsets, groupings and repetition of groupings.
    Using spectrograms in this way focuses on readily apparent clusters and
    gaps of visual material that indicate rhythmic patterns—groupings that
    often align with the aural experience of the music.</p>

    <p>This study demonstrates the importance of grouping structure for
    understanding Meshuggah’s polyrhythmic style. In the context of a musical
    style that pits riffs against the 4/4-based structure, riffs that emerge
    as if in the middle of some much longer process destabilize this
    relationship. With song lyrics often centered on the desire for radical
    freedom or enlightenment, and musical patterns that ritualize the
    suppression of elements that break the “order” of 4/4, I suggest that
    Meshuggah’s use of repetition and variation explores ideas of freedom and
    rigid control, liveliness and predictability.</p>
