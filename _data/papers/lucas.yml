    <p>Lightshows at contemporary rock concerts generally create an immersive,
    multi-sensory experience. Their most sophisticated variants, however,
    provide a visual analysis of the music as it unfolds. This paper presents
    a case study of the analytical lightshow, by examining how the intricate
    lightshows of extreme metal band Meshuggah contribute an interpretive
    layer that not only promotes multi-sensory engagement, but also actively
    guides listeners through songs’ formal structures.</p>
    <p>Theorists (Pieslak 2007; Capuzzo 2018; Lucas 2018) have analyzed
    Meshuggah’s idiosyncratic approach to rhythmic complexity. By reading
    Meshuggah’s lightshows as immanent visual analysis, this paper bears out
    Lochhead’s exploration of “sonic meaning as informed by sight” (2006, 67),
    and shows how lighting design can mediate between musical complexity and
    listeners’ engagement.</p>
    <p>Meshuggah’s lightshows are exhaustively synchronized to the rhythmic
    patterns of the guitars and drums; meticulous use of color, brightness,
    directionality, placement pattern, and beam movement provide additional
    information about gesture, articulation, and pitch. My analyses, supported
    by lighting designer Edvard Hansson’s digital models of the lightshow and
    by video playback, align salient features of the lightshows with
    transcriptions, showing both how closely their rhythmic contents align,
    and how riff attributes are enhanced by lighting.</p>
    <p>Meshuggah’s analytical lightshows provide a three-dimensional visual
    score that dramatizes rhythms while guiding listeners through each riff.
    By presenting analysis and performance simultaneously and as each other,
    Meshuggah combines technical virtuosity with rock authenticity, and
    provides another example of what Lucas (2014) calls “coercive
    synesthesia,” as the lighting becomes an inextricable part of the musical
    experience.</p>
