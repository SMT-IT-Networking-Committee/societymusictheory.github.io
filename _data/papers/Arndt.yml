    <p>This paper is concerned with a metaphorical kind of musical speech, which for centuries has been figured with linguistic terms like phrase and <em>Satz</em>. The term <em>Satz</em>, translated as “sentence,” has come to designate only a particular design for a theme. Yet Schoenberg states that the term <em>Satz</em>, “is best used only in the grammatical sense.” Neglect of the grammatical sense of <em>Satz</em> has led to a proliferation of redundant and misleading terms for <em>Sätze</em> and their parts when they appear in different designs.</p>
    <p>In linguistic speech, every <em>turn</em> of <em>phrase</em>, every <em>rotation</em> of the <em>words</em> from highlighting one aspect of a scene to another, fulfills one or more functions in coordinating the senses of the words according to certain tropes, most basically certain image schemas. So, too, in musical speech, every <em>rotation</em> of the <em>Gestalten</em> fulfills one or more functions according to certain tropes or formative principles. From a certain perspective, these principles are <em>rotation</em> itself, and the <em>polarity</em> of expansion and contraction along the <em>pole</em> or axis of rotation. Drawing on comparative analysis of Western art music and chant from the Republic of Georgia (which is emically understood as being comprised of <em>mukhlebi</em>, literally <em>Sätze</em>), I argue that rotation and polarity give form to musical speech, differentiating sentences (<em>Sätze</em>), clauses (<em>Teilsätze</em>), and phrases in the same way in terms of function. This elucidation of sentences, clauses, and phrases makes it relatively easy to understand the countless <em>Sätze</em> in musical speech, regardless of their style, formal position, or complications.</p>
