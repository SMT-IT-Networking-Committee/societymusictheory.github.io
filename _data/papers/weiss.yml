  <p>The “galant schemata” of Robert Gjerdingen’s <i>Music in the Galant
  Style</i> (2007) are commonly described in terms of voice leading or harmony,
  aspects that do not reflect their standard configuration as short, discrete
  chunks of music that could be deployed in a linear fashion. This central
  aspect of Gjerdingen’s theory has received little attention and is not always
  observed in analysis. In many cases, grouping boundaries within a phrase are
  overlooked, thus contradicting the supposed aural accessibility of schemata,
  one of the main foundations of Gjerdingen’s project.</p>
  <p>The importance of recognizing phrase structure can be illustrated with
  reference to what John Rice has called the “Heartz” schema. Rice explains how
  this “schema” moves from a root-position tonic to a six-four and back again,
  but stipulates nothing about rhythm or metric stress. Consequently, the Heartz
  may seem to be little more than a pedal six-four. Yet by factoring in harmonic
  rhythm and metric stresses, we can define a more specific formula; and
  identifying its common form-functional usage as the “basic idea” in a period
  theme-type reveals a further layer of conventionality. When we approach the
  music of nineteenth-century composers—who are traditionally regarded as having
  eschewed conventional materials—knowledge of this conventionalized form and
  usage allows us to see them faithfully employing established formulas. It also
  enables us to identify the schema more plausibly in other situations, and with
  slight harmonic or melodic variations. The case of the Heartz exemplifies
  principles that should ideally inform our conception of all such schemata.</p>
