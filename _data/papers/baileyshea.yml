abstract: |
  <p>In <i>The Sounds of Poetry, </i>Robert Pinsky writes that “the line and
  syntactical unit are not necessarily the same,” a statement presented with
  such matter-of-fact simplicity that one might be forgiven for wondering why it
  would be worthy of quotation at all. And yet Pinsky introduces it as “one of
  the most important principles of [the] book.” Indeed, as he points out, “much
  unsatisfying reading and much inferior writing proceeds from not getting this
  right” (1998, 30).</p>
  <p>When composers set complex poetry to music, they often have to make
  difficult choices: Should their phrases follow the lines or the syntax? Should
  they try to project both simultaneously? Music analysts often acknowledge the
  importance of these decisions, but the subject is usually broached only on an
  ad hoc basis. As a result, there has been little direct research on broader
  compositional norms, and many questions arise. What strategies do composers
  use to shape musical phrases? How might such decisions reflect the inbuilt
  tensions of individual poems? This paper takes a comparative approach,
  introducing examples from multiple styles and genres to provide an overview of
  compositional options and expressive effects. </p>
