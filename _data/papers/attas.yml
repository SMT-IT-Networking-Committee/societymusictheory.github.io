    <p>Despite ongoing calls for diversity in music theory pedagogy and
    analysis, for the decolonization of music research societies, and for the
    decolonization of academia more broadly, music theory seems slow to
    change. Perhaps this is partly because the field’s researchers are
    predominantly white and focused primarily on the repertoire and analytical
    techniques of Western Europe. Yet these should not be excuses. This poster
    calls the discipline to action, not by providing definitive answers, but
    by showing that decolonization begins by asking appropriate questions.
    Using a case analysis of “How I Feel” by Indigenous DJ collective A Tribe
    Called Red, I focus on a particular kind of decolonization, considering
    the relationship between a white settler researcher and Indigenous
    musicians in present-day Canada. I begin by presenting typical analytical
    starting places (the song’s large-scale form, pitch content, texture, and
    rapped flow) before explaining how the preliminary analysis (and the
    sketch of the discipline it represents) might be seen as colonial and
    insufficient, given the dominance of a particular culturally-situated
    understanding of music and analysis. Drawing from Indigenous and settler
    scholars in multiple disciplines, I explore several research questions
    that could rebalance the analysis, and by extension the discipline, toward
    decolonizing and Indigenizing musical perspectives. By outlining numerous
    analytical strategies, I present a view of decolonization as a process,
    open the discipline to multiple perspectives, and inspire action among
    theorists to reconsider biases and decolonize analysis in their own local
    contexts.</p>
