  <p>Kant’s philosophy is frequently mentioned in connection with Beethoven
  and his music. Most notably, Kinderman’s famous study of Beethoven’s “symbol
  for the Deity” (1985) interprets the Ninth Symphony and <i>Missa
  Solemnis</i> as depicting the Kantian notion that God is inaccessible to
  human knowledge. As documentary evidence of Beethoven’s interest in Kant,
  scholars often cite a paraphrase in the conversation books of a quotation
  from the <i>Second Critique</i>, though Beethoven likely obtained this
  second-hand from a <i>Wiener Zeitschrift</i> article rather than from any
  direct engagement with Kant’s actual text (Cooper 2001).</p>
  <p>Surprisingly, for all the attempts to link Beethoven to Kant’s philosophy,
  no specific scholarly attention has been given to the one work by Kant that we
  are certain Beethoven had in his library—<i>Universal Natural History and
  Theory of the Heavens</i> (1755)—at least one passage from which the composer
  copied into his <i>Tagebuch</i>. The content of this text, written early in
  Kant’s career, complicates conventional views of the philosopher’s influence
  on Beethoven. Though Kant scholars disagree over how to interpret some of its
  details, the text expresses at least some ideas that do not entirely align
  with the “post-critical” philosophy for which Kant is chiefly known. In
  particular, unlike Kant’s later and more familiar philosophical texts, it
  appears to express greater confidence in the comprehensibility and knowability
  of God through the empirical observation of nature.</p>
  <p>I go on to demonstrate that themes in <i>Universal Natural History</i> are
  also prominent in other books in Beethoven’s library, including Christoph
  Christian Sturm’s <i>Betrachtungen der Werke Gottes</i> (1773) and Caspar
  Peucer’s <i>Commentarius de praecipuis generibus divinationum</i> (1553). I
  show also that its astronomical emphasis resonates with Beethoven’s interest
  in the stars, which is reflected as a specific musical topic in several of his
  works. </p>
  <p>The ideas in <i>Universal Natural History</i> were common in strands of the
  Enlightenment distinct from that represented by Kant’s “Copernican Revolution”
  in epistemology. Acknowledging the relevance of this text to Beethoven’s
  worldview enables a more precise and nuanced understanding of the composer’s
  relationship to the Enlightenment with which he is so often associated.</p>
