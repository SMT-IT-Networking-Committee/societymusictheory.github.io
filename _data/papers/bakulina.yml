    <p>The Russian music-theoretical tradition is generally perceived as
    decidedly non-Schenkerian. This is generally true; however, ideas similar
    to Schenker’s have appeared in Russian-language scholarship. In this
    paper, I show elements of linear thinking in several of Leo Mazel’s
    writings on Chopin, with a special focus on his monograph (1937) on
    Chopin’s Fantasy, op. 49. My principal objectives are (1) to draw
    parallels between Mazel’s and Schenker’s work, and (2) to build an
    original Schenkerian reading of the Fantasy, a reading informed by Mazel’s
    quasi-prolongational insights.</p>

    <p>Several elements in Mazel’s work have direct relevance to Schenkerian
    theory. First, Mazel explains mm. 1–2 of the Fantasy as projecting a
    perfect fourth on two levels. Second, his harmonic reductions essentially
    represent what Schenkerians call imaginary continuo. This is also relevant
    to his article (1965) on Chopin’s A-major prelude from op. 28. The third
    and most intriguing linear element is Mazel’s analysis of the Fantasy’s
    Lento passage. This analysis, which I “translate” into standard
    Schenkerian notation, amounts to a prolongational idea, while also
    suggesting motivic parallelism among descending seconds. I finish by
    incorporating this idea into my own, strictly Schenkerian reading of the
    work. This reading is also partly (mostly at the deepest level) based on
    Carl Schachter’s analysis of the same piece. My reading thus synthesizes
    ideas from Russian- and English-language analytical traditions; it also
    takes linear elements, implicit in Mazel’s work, to a level of structural
    complexity offered by Schenker’s theories.</p>
