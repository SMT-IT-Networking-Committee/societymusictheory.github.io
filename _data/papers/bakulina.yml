    <p>This paper explores cadential structures in Sergei Rachmaninoff’s songs
    for solo voice and piano, with a special emphasis on op. 34 (first
    published in 1913). Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest to
    the cadence in tonal repertoires, mostly of the 18th century (Caplin
    2004; Burstein 2014; Neuwirth and Bergé 2015; Harrison 2016); but
    cadences in late Romantic music remain less studied. Combining a
    form-functional and a linear-analytical (Schenkerian) approach, I show
    how Rachmaninoff obscures familiar cadential patterns inherited from
    the Classical tonal tradition.</p>
    <p>My starting theoretical point is William Caplin’s (1998 and 2004)
    conceptual distinction between the cadential function (an area of form),
    progression (a series of chords), and arrival (a single point in time).
    Rachmaninoff often uses standard cadential patterns in a straight-forward
    way, where Caplin’s three categories comfortably and obviously coincide.
    And yet, one observes an increasing tendency towards experimentation in
    this regard. I show three specific forms that concealment of the cadential
    function can take: (1) a tonic pedal obscures the cadential progression,
    (2) the cadential progression migrates to a middleground level, and (3)
    established cadential progressions are completely discarded, and closure is
    achieved by melodic means (that is, a cadential arrival is present, but a
    progressions is not). My analyses witness how a Schenkerian approach helps
    uncover underlying familiar structures hidden by idiosyncratic surfaces,
    while also showing Rachmaninoff’s compositional evolution, ultimately
    leading toward novel approaches to closure.</p>
