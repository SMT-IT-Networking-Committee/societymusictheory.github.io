    <p>Neil Lerner and others have explored the indelible impact of a musical
    approach, often casually called the “Copland Sound,” upon a significant
    cross-section of American films. Following Lerner’s suggestion that this
    approach is more properly described as a multiplicity of “Copland sounds,”
    this paper explores and catalogs constellations of particular musical
    parameters that were welded by Copland to specific extra-musical contexts
    (whether provided by ballet or filmic settings, texts of vocal works, or
    contemporaneous historical associations such as World War II). This thinner
    slicing of the Copland Sound into specific topics (labeled here as, e.g.,
    <i>idyllic nature, protagonistic introspection, triumphalism, </i>and
    <i>exuberant country dance</i>) first opens the way to exploring the
    composer’s manipulation and combination of his own topics (à la Hatten 1994,
    2004), thus allowing for the tracing of narratives in his other music. In
    addition, by prying these styles loose from their original dramatic settings,
    Copland also foreshadows their appropriation by subsequent composers for novel
    programmatic purposes since the 1950s. The Copland Sound is so closely bound
    to Americana because the extra-musical subjects with which it was first
    associated were unequivocally American: the virgin frontier, the wild west,
    New York City, rural New England, Abraham Lincoln, John Henry. But I will show
    that later troping on this package of styles can point alternatively to a
    broad sense of Americanness, to the specific topics each style represents, or
    to both.</p>
