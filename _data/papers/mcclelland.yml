    <p><i>Tempesta </i>is a term recently coined to apply to music that
    exhibits agitated or violent characteristics in order to evoke terror and
    chaos. Features of the style include fast tempo, rapid scale passages,
    driving rhythmic figurations, strong accents, full textures, and robust
    instrumentation including prominent brass and timpani. Music of this type
    was used for storm scenes, which in operas of the seventeenth and
    eighteenth centuries are almost invariably of supernatural origin, and
    other frightening experiences such as pursuit (especially by demons or
    furies), madness, and rage.</p>

    <p>This kind of “stormy” music has acquired the label <i>Sturm und
    Drang</i>, implying a relationship to German literature which is
    erroneous. Haydn’s so-called <i>Sturm und Drang </i>symphonies exhibit
    characteristics that are no different stylistically to the depictions of
    storms in other genres. There is no evidence of Haydn suffering from some
    kind of personal crisis in his middle years. Moreover, there are many
    topical references to <i>tempesta </i>in his subsequent symphonic output,
    not to mention the instrumental works of many of his contemporaries.</p>

    <p><i>Sturm und Drang </i>is therefore a term that was never really fit
    for purpose. A more appropriate aesthetic context is the emergence of
    Gothic literature and art, and of ideas about the “sublime of terror,”
    which began emerging earlier in the century. “Stormy” music was capable of
    producing an emotional response of some magnitude, and was therefore a
    powerful tool in the composer’s expressive armory. As the fast counterpart
    to <i>ombra</i>, the term <i>tempesta</i> must be seen as more
    appropriate.</p>
