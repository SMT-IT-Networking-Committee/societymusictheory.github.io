    <p>“Suppose you want to retune your violin,” writes David Lewin, “so that
    all its open strings sound notes of the F major harmony.” As Lewin
    demonstrates, the most efficient solutions involve a total shift of 5
    semitones. But when Heinrich Biber retunes his violin to an F major harmony,
    the violinist-composer chooses a relatively inefficient solution. In his
    seventh Mystery Sonata, Biber raises the G string a perfect fourth and the D
    string a minor third, while lowering the E string a major third—a total shift
    of 12 semitones. Biber’s hand-grip notation, indicating finger positions
    rather than sounding results, can also unsettle the player. The Mystery
    Sonatas thus prompt two related questions, which connect transformational
    voice leading to the phenomenology of performance: How do alternate tunings
    relate to standard tuning? And how might they affect players?</p>

    <p>Analyzing Biber’s alternate tunings according to two metrics of
    transformational voice leading—consistency and displacement—reveals
    overlapping categories. “Quintal scordatura,” which preserve adjacent-string
    fifths, tend to be more uniform, and they include zones where notated and
    sounding intervals match. “Chordal scordatura,” in which the open strings
    realize a single harmony, generally involve more displacement. Yet
    psychological research on altered pitch feedback suggests that a mix of
    consistency and displacement is most unsettling for players. It implies that
    scordatura are disruptive when they preserve aspects of standard tuning,
    creating both expected and surprising notes. Analyzing scordatura, then,
    ultimately shows how instruments function as tonal spaces and spaces for
    musical action.</p>
