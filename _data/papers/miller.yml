title: "The Puzzle of Style: On Leonard Meyer's Unlikely Replications"

abstract: |
    <p>Strangely enough, the concept of style has rarely received sustained
    attention from music theorists. While many particular styles have been
    studied at length, the only major inquiry into the concept itself in
    recent decades is Leonard Meyer’s <i>Style and Music</i> of 1989. Meyer’s
    account, describing style as replicated patterning resulting from choices
    made within some set of constraints, has continued to be cited but has not
    been further elaborated or challenged in any systematic way. Given the
    wide range of intellectual developments both contemporary with <i>Style
    and Music</i> (especially in other disciplines, which Meyer cites widely
    but not systematically) and more recent (including a variety of “turns” in
    music scholarship), it is high time to revisit the concept.</p>
    <p>This paper begins that inquiry by considering a class of thought
    experiments that might be called “style puzzles,” in which some
    paradoxical or impossible imagined work is probed for insights about
    style, replication, or related concepts. Meyer himself discusses one
    famous example, Borges’s “Pierre Menard, Author of the <i>Quixote</i>”—but
    Meyer’s reading fails to fully grasp the stylistic implications of the
    story’s central paradox, and thus points symptomatically to a gap in his
    theory. I situate Meyer alongside readings of this and other style puzzles
    from art historians, including Arthur Danto and Whitney Davis, whose
    investigations spur cross-disciplinary difficulties alongside insights
    into important questions: How are replication and choice manifested and
    recognized in/as musical style? More broadly, what can and should the
    notion of style do for the study of music?</p>
