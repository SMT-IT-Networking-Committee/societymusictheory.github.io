title: "Algorithmic Agents, Musical Objects, and Mediated Styles: Reframing Computational Music Theory"

abstract: |
  <p>One of the core concerns of computational music theory is the statistical
  modeling of large corpora, often drawing on tools from computational
  linguistics, and often with the aim of modeling human cognition. Such
  data-driven work relies on an increasingly sophisticated set of algorithmic
  tools, including techniques drawn from machine learning. Meanwhile, in
  disciplinary contexts ranging from anthropology to science and technology
  studies, an emerging critical discourse on “big data” and machine learning
  suggests that we resist the notion of algorithms as neutral tools operating on
  neutral data and instead consider the ways they function as agents and
  mediators, derivative of human agency but with their own potentially
  counterintuitive efficacies and interpretive capacities. Bringing this
  perspective to bear on computational music theory, we might ask: what kinds of
  agencies emerge from our music-analytical algorithms? And how do algorithms
  mediate our relation to music, and vice versa?</p>
  <p>To broach this line of inquiry, I meet the computational linguistic tools
  of musical corpus studies with linguistic anthropologist Paul Kockelman’s
  Peircean account of algorithmic semiotics, which highlights the unintuitive
  ways that algorithms attend to musical objects, along with the means by which
  algorithmic interpretants both constitute and constrain musical knowledge.
  After introducing the broader theoretical argument and then examining a
  relatively simple algorithm in technical and semiotic detail, I consider some
  recent machine-learning approaches to harmonic function, which highlight not
  only questions of algorithmic agency but also problems related to the
  identification, theorization, and replication of musical style more
  generally.</p>
