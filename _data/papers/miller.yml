    <p>Most scholars understand Stockhausen’s serial technique as one that essentially mitigates binaries. I argue that Stockhausen’s representation of gender also inhabits ambiguous space in his operatic heptology <em>Licht</em>. This is surprising because at first glance it seems Stockhausen reinforced traditional gender stereotypes in the three Gestalt-protagonists Michael, Eve and Lucifer. Without question, Stockhausen gendered specific intervals in the tone-rows associated with the protagonists. More surprising, he claimed that by dismembering and reassembling this coded material, he could create “half-beings” [Halbwesen], “hermaphrodites” [Zwitter], and “people who become androgynous.” These startling statements have been left uninterpreted by the Stockhausen community in the published literature. I begin to address this lacuna by analyzing serial mechanics in three pieces: <em>Xi</em>, <em>Elufa</em> and <em>Lichter-Wasser</em>, particularly with regard to ambiguities in serial order position and techniques of intermodulation. I conclude that questions of gender play a bigger role in Stockhausen’s operas than is generally recognized, and suggest ways in which this discussion could continue, particularly if the net is cast more broadly to encompass costume, movement, and libretto.</p>
    <p>Beyond its engagement with embodiment and temporality, this approach permits interpretations in terms of disability, musical forces, and concepts in technical timbre analysis. Most importantly, the critique of the discrete apparatus of post-tonal theory takes seriously the concern with music as “characteristic gesture,” “idealized dance,” or more broadly, as something meant to happen <em>in time.</em></p>
