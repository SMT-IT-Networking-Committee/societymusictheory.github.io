abstract: |
  <p>Rudolph Reti’s book, <i>The Thematic Process in Music</i>, has faced harsh
  criticism since its initial release in 1951. Despite its frequent dismissal,
  authors continue to cite this contentious work, and Reti has become a ready
  straw man, a veritable “foot-notorious” figure among scholars of music. The
  most acerbic criticisms tend to dwell on Reti’s inadequate graphic apparatus,
  severely limiting the authority of his prose when not ignoring it altogether.
  Placing the interpretive focus on the author’s words rather than his
  analytical notation brings to light cues that help locate the work in its own
  intellectual context, namely, Reti’s prominent references to the mathematician
  and philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead.</p>
  <p>Through a step-by-step reevaluation of Reti’s well-known analysis of
  Beethoven’s Ninth, this paper offers a new, more complex, and nuanced view of
  the thematic process derived from the many parallels between the cosmological
  constructs presented in Whitehead’s <i>Process and Reality</i> (1929) and
  Reti’s analytical observations in <i>The Thematic Process in Music</i>. Poetry
  written in the wake of Reti’s death by his widow, Jean Réti-Forbes, provides
  additional supporting evidence linking the thematic process with Whitehead’s
  process philosophy.</p>
  <p>This study endows features of Reti’s theory routinely dismissed as
  arbitrary with new significance as the focus is moved away from the world of
  “motivic minutiae” toward the realms of creativity, narrative structure,
  cognition, and musical meaning. Further, treating process as purposeful in
  <i>The Thematic Process in Music</i> points to Reti’s unrecognized role as a
  pioneer in developing cross-disciplinary approaches to music theory.</p>
