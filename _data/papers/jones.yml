  <p>“When will we listen to black women?” was the rallying cry echoed
  throughout the streets, in journalistic think pieces, and on social media in
  2017. These reactions followed the polling results revealing black women’s
  collective voting power in arguably the most contentious elections in the
  twenty-first century thus far. In an era of women-founded movements such as
  #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, and #SayHerName, some use messianic language to
  characterize women as “saving the day,” despite being marginalized.
  Thought-leaders are noticing the socio-political inaudibility of black women
  liberators highlighting the injustices and bias woven into the fabric of the
  US popular imagination. Therefore, it is no surprise that when audiences were
  prompted to imagine a black woman as God in the film <i>The Shack</i> (2017),
  reviewers and critics described the movie concept as heresy, reflecting
  viewers’ racial and gender bias. And unlike previous cinematic
  representations, <i>The Shack</i> did not attempt to envoice God in its music
  soundtrack. Its negative reception is comparatively striking given how many
  films, soundtracks, and albums representing black men as God or a messiah
  (i.e. Moses, Elijah, and Jesus) were released within the last five years
  alone: the cinematic revival of Langston Hughes’ gospel play <i>The Black
  Nativity</i> (2013); the controversial cable television show <i>Black
  Jesus</i> (2014); D’Angelo’s highly anticipated <i>Black Messiah</i> (2014)
  album, and the film <i>The Revival! Experience</i> (2015), starring gospel
  musician Mali Music. However, the hypothesis that no one is listening to black
  women as liberators falters when considering the reception of Nkeiru Okoye’s
  critically acclaimed opera <i>Harriet Tubman</i> in 2017. <i>Harriet
  Tubman</i> is derived from the biography of the historical figure, a woman
  affectionately referred to as black Moses. </p>
  <p>This talk addresses the perceived inaudibility of black women liberators in
  the US popular imagination by constructing an anti-oppressionist listening and
  observing of Harriet Tubman in Nkeiru Okoye’s composition. As we analyze the
  composer’s cultural intervention through the prism of race/gender/class, we
  will ask: What is the sound of black women’s messianism? How might we
  undertake an anti-oppressionist listening of sonic worlds? </p>
