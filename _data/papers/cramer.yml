title: "“The Tune Makes Very Scant Difference”??? Schema and Meaning in Guthrie's and Seeger's Performances of “This Land Is Your Land”"

abstract: |
    <p>Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land” is best known in the version
    popularized in the 1950s by Pete Seeger and others. In examining the song’s
    1940 original manuscript, numerous commentators have observed verses about
    social problems and argued that the omission of those words in the later
    version is responsible for an idyllic, celebratory sunniness not intended by
    Guthrie. I argue, though, that the 1950s’ version’s optimism has a
    <i>musical</i> cause. Seeger understands the tune through different cognitive
    schemas than does Guthrie, and thus he shifts the song’s meaning.</p>
    <p>In recent music theory, cognitive schemas have been most widely noticed in
    Gjerdingen’s studies of composers forming their craft by internalizing
    repertories of idiomatic exemplars rather than by proceeding from generalized
    plans and principles. But generalized plans and principles can involve
    cognitive schemas too. Thus, in Seeger’s performance, the generalized
    scale-degree and tension-stability schemas of common-practice tonality
    intersect with linguistic schemas of intonational emphasis to express that
    <i>this</i> country (not another) belongs to all. In contrast, the schemas
    behind Guthrie’s interpretation are found in specific compositional models,
    including the gospel hymn “When the World’s on Fire,” Irving Berlin’s “God
    Bless America,” and the hobo song “Wabash Cannonball.” These exemplars guide
    Guthrie’s emphases, offering a reason why Guthrie might have expected
    listeners to hear a different narrative. Without knowing this context,
    however, listeners are likely to hear the song in Seeger’s generalized tonal
    way, where even a stroll through dust clouds sounds like tension resolved.</p>
