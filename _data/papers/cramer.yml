        <p>Alfred Cramer is Associate Professor of Music at Pomona College, where he is also affiliated with the department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science. While much of his research is related to early twentieth-century modernism (particularly that of the Second Viennese School), a current project involves Woody Guthrie and the mid-twentieth-century American Folk Music movement. He remains an active violinist. This presentation on Ruth Crawford Seeger's music brings together all of these interests.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>After having achieved recognition as a modernist composer and produced sophisticated transcriptions for the 1941 Lomax publication <em>Our Singing Country,</em> Ruth Crawford Seeger turned her attention in the 1940s toward creating a music program at her children’s preschool. This volunteer work led to the publication of three songbooks. <em>American Folk Songs for Children (1948)</em>, <em>Animal Folk Songs for Children (1951)</em>, and <em>American Folk Songs for Christmas (1953)</em>, which include traditional children’s songs and lullabies set alongside songs usually sung by grown-ups, some of which she gave new words appealing to children. Crawford’s piano accompaniments in these volumes are as simple as her modernistic compositions are complex—ingeniously crafted to evoke folk instruments and be played by pianists of average ability while teaching a preschool class. However, the easily recognizable repetitions of intervals and melodic patterns in her song arrangements connect these songs to her modernistic works with similar compositional elements. As Crawford argues in her introductions to these volumes, such musical repetitions not only make the songs easy to learn but also help develop musical intuitions in children.</p>
    <p>Our discussion will be drawn from our experience directing a group of children to sing some of these songs in a 2015 concert which spanned Ruth Crawford Seeger's oeuvre, including modernist works such as her <em>String Quartet 1931</em>. In placing these songs at the heart of the concert, we hoped to demonstrate that the different musical styles reveal the <em>same</em> musician playing a multitude of equally important musical roles in her life.</p>
