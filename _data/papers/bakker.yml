title: "Prosody to Song: The Curious Case of Hungarian Art Song"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Hungarian art song occupies a unique position within the art song
    repertoire. It is linguistically and geographically isolated—its closest
    linguistic neighbors are thousands of miles from its geographic borders—yet it
    is steeped in the Western art-music tradition. Further complexifying its
    position are the language’s distinctive musical elements. Spoken Hungarian has
    four distinguishing rhythmic and melodic shapes, all of which must be clearly
    articulated for semantic disambiguation. How do composers negotiate these
    semantic requirements with issues of compositional freedom and style?</p>
    <p>My poster shares two types of information. First, it shares data on how
    four twentieth-century Hungarian composers address the semantic-musical
    conundrum: Zoltán Kodály, Béla Bartók, György Ligeti, and György Kurtág. Most
    prosody-based corpus studies focus on rhythmic contrast according to the
    composer’s linguistic background, but I argue that this approach is not rich
    enough to capture the complexity of the Hungarian language. Instead, my poster
    presents a new model, Prosody to Song, that focuses on direct comparison of
    text and its musical realization. </p>
    <p>My poster also highlights analytical applications of the Prosody to Song
    approach on the local level. Although interpretive musical analysis is not
    typically the goal of corpus studies, I argue that a composer’s “compliance”
    to spoken patterns of language can offer insight into his or her
    interpretation of the text.  </p>
