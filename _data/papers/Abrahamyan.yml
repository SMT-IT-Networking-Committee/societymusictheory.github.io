    <p>In English-language scholarship, the work of Yuri Kholopov (1932–2003) has been addressed by Philip Ewell, Zachary Cairns, and Christopher Segall, among others. However, the intellectual history of Kholopov’s seminal achievement—the theory of universal harmony<em>—</em>has not received due attention. Kholopov introduced this theory as a comprehensive method for analyzing all music ranging from Ancient Greece to the twentieth century. In this paper, I argue that the theory of universal harmony presented a hidden outlet for manifesting the theorist’s Orthodox beliefs. </p>
    <p>Although Kholopov was a devout Orthodox, he could not openly express his beliefs due to the Soviet government’s hostility toward religion. His writings are, nonetheless, permeated with terminology and metaphors borrowed from the religious philosopher Aleksei Losev’s (1893–1988) neo-Platonic understanding of music as representing the originary unity resting on numbers. Only in 2006 did Kholopov’s affinity to Losev’s doctrine became explicit in a posthumous publication: Kholopov stated that the aesthetic qualities of music have the capability to bring one nearer to God and argued that the act of composition represents the process of manifesting the Platonic <em>eidos</em> in the sonic realm. Drawing on the work of Larisa Kirillina, I first outline the common features between the theory of universal harmony and Losev’s doctrine of unity. I then consider the specificities of the theory’s practical application by turning to several music analyses by Kholopov. Finally, I examine to what degree a music theory as such may function as a subversive apparatus capable of resisting censorship.</p>
