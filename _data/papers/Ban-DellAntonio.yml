    <p>As North American college instructors, we can design strategies to accommodate disabled students and facilitate their completion of the learning tasks that we have defined as essential to music theory pedagogy.  Those staff-notation-based, counterpoint-driven learning outcomes are the standards by which we define our academic discipline, essential functional principles that we can trace back to at least Rameau’s <em>Traité de l’harmonie</em> and <em>Nouveau système théorique.</em></p>
    <p>But these principles can also provide noteworthy cognitive hurdles that limit access and bring about epistemic injustice. Stephanie Ban has proposed considering the musical thought of Rousseau, arguably the most significant contemporary interlocutor of Rameau, from a disability studies angle, considering his self-awareness as “disabled” from a social-model perspective precisely because of his struggles with comprehending and applying the musical principles that Rameau was codifying as essential for the French elite. </p>
    <p>We might even see Rousseau experiencing a sort of “disability gain” through his efforts to articulate musical priorities that challenged the primacy of Rameau’s models, though insufficiently to prevent them from becoming normate. Considering Rousseau’s attempt at an anti-Rameau theory more closely as a neurodivergent epistemic disruption might help us shake off some of the inevitability of functional harmony and species counterpoint as foundational starting points for undergraduate music theory today, and also understand how those pedagogical approaches create cognitive barriers that exclude some folks—neodivergent or otherwise—who would have valuable contributions to epistemological discourse on music and musicking.</p>
