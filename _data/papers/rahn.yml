abstract: |
  <p>Following scholarship that expands musical schemata research beyond the
  galant style (Gjerdingen 2011, Love 2012, Stoia 2013), this project uses
  schema theory as a framework for analyzing film music derived from a
  particular rock idiom. Focusing on the music of Trent Reznor, film composer
  and founder of the rock project Nine Inch Nails, this paper shows how a
  recurring, salient contrapuntal gesture accrues extra-musical significance
  across three films, appearing during pivotal narrative moments.</p>
  <p>The “Fa-Mi” schema, found throughout Reznor’s output, comprises two
  contrapuntal elements: a descent from ^4 to ^3 in the upper voice, and either
  a tonic pedal or lowered ^7 to ^1 in the bass. Typically featured at the ends
  of phrases, the schema often appears as a major-mode inflection of a minor
  pentatonic or minor-mode pitch collection, or alternatively may suggest
  Mixolydian mode.</p>
  <p>After exploring prototypical instances and variations of the schema in Nine
  Inch Nails’ music, I discuss three films scored by Reznor: <i>The Social
  Network </i>(2010), <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo </i>(2011), and <i>Gone
  Girl </i>(2014). Instead of functioning as a traditional leitmotif, the
  “Fa-Mi” carries a cluster of extra-musical associations shared across the
  three films. The schema accompanies scenes featuring a shocking plot
  revelation, a shift in the power dynamic between characters, or moments that
  are positively valenced on a local narrative level but have long-term negative
  repercussions. This project thus broadens the syntactical emphasis of schema
  theory by examining how schemata can acquire extra-musical meaning in film
  scores.</p>
