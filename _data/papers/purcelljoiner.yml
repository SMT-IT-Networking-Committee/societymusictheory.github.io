abstract: |
  <p>The manuscript HB I 95 of the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart
  (hereafter Stuttgart 95), is a thirteenth-century songbook that scholars have
  long held to have originated at Weingarten Monastery in southern Germany. Its
  fame primarily rests on its large and diverse collection of 221 sacred songs
  from multiple liturgical genres. My research, the first major study of
  Stuttgart 95, has revealed that this manuscript was the product of Engelberg: a
  Swiss double cloister, a monastic community housing both men and women. As a
  product of Engelberg’s liturgical and devotional traditions, Stuttgart 95 shows
  a keen focus on the adoration of the Virgin mother. One specific outcome of
  this emphasis of Marian devotion is that the music in Stuttgart 95 presents a
  repeating melodic pattern of aurally calling to Mary—sonically emphasizing the
  sound of her name.</p>
  <p>In this paper I explore how the melodically inflected adornment of her name
  was heightened through the use of musical citation—revealing a creative musical
  practice that relied on quotation and attests to the interweaving of devotional
  and liturgical occasions through shared music. Furthermore, this quotational
  practice can be found in chantbooks from other locales, indicating that, in
  addition to well-known refrain traditions in vernacular musics, monophonic
  devotional traditions too might have relied on migrating musical passages in
  ways heretofore unknown.</p>
  <p>This paper will focus on a case study of one antiphon and two sequences. I
  will show that <i>Gaudendum nobis est</i> shares musical material with <i>Salve
  nobilis virga iesse</i>, a responsory well known in the German-speaking realms,
  as well as the alleluia, <i>Sancta dei genitrix</i>, found in Stuttgart 95’s
  Marian votive mass. The two sequences I examine, <i>Imperatrix gloriosa</i> and
  <i>Gaude mater luminis</i>, possess a mutual migrating refrain, previously
  unknown to musicologists. These shared melodic gestures result in an
  intentional web of intertextuality woven throughout different liturgical
  periods and ceremonies, all with the goal of musically heightening the name of
  the Virgin mother.</p>
