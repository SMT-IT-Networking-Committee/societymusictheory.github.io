abstract: | 
    <p>Much of the analytical discourse concerning harmony in Anton Webern’s chromatic music has focused on the consistency of the intervallic content expressed vertically and horizontally within a particular work, while often leaving a critical interpretive question unaddressed: what is it that compels us to hear multiple pitches as a single harmonious sound in this music, which freely employs consonance and dissonance? Or, more briefly, how do we as listeners and performers decide which simultaneous sounds belong together?</p>
    <p>In this paper, I show that Webern’s compositions demonstrate a consistent use of particular harmonic intervals—major sevenths and minor ninths—within sonic contexts which heavily promote the fusion of different sounds into singular percepts through synchronous onsets and offsets; high degrees of similarity in timbre, dynamics, and articulation; and parallel changes in sound qualities (including pitch and intensity). Following this, I argue that these intervals are employed with the intent to fuse not only sounds, but also their sources, which can be heard as briefly coalescing into expressive unities through the performance of musical gestures. </p>
    <p>To capture this experience, I develop an analytical method that directly builds upon the work of Alfred Cramer, who has argued that these intervals were critical to the harmonic vocabulary of Webern’s early compositions because they strongly promote the experience of fusion between sound objects. My analyses shift the focus towards the potential for specific sound sources to be heard as fused, by considering instances in which recognizable melodic gestures are expressed through multiple synchronized sounds/sound sources. </p>
