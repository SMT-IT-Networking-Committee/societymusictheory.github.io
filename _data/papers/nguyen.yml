abstract: |
  <p>The syncretic Vietnamese <i>vọng cổ </i>music has much potential as an area
  of academic and theoretical research. Roughly translated to “longing for the
  old traditions,” <i>vọng cổ</i> is a modern twentieth-century genre that
  combines traditional Eastern instrumentation and modal practices with
  Westernized concepts of cadence, meter, and form. It is best summarized as a
  syncretic traditional world music genre featuring modern and traditional
  instruments, improvised heterophonic accompaniment, a flexible pentatonic
  notation and modal system, and a variable six-part framework of fixed
  cadences. Over time, these basic ideas are transformed by common practice and
  musical elaborations that evolve the genre to where it is today.</p>
  <p><i>Vọng cổ</i> is an oral tradition that leaves much to be documented and
  analyzed in terms of its musical practices. Previous researchers on Vietnamese
  music have individually focused on Vietnamese modal scales, tuning and pitch
  systems, traditional instrumentation, and cultural implications. While there
  are English and Vietnamese electronic and print media regarding basic concepts
  of <i>vọng cổ</i>, there are few in-depth English-language studies or
  theoretical discussions on this topic. This study attempts to provide a body
  of information illustrating the origins and concept of <i>vọng cổ</i>, its
  associated scalar modes, and the basics of its form. It touches upon musical
  features such as cadences, rhythm, and modulation related to <i>vọng cổ
  </i>music. Altogether, these aspects contribute to practical performance that
  defines stylistic tendencies specific to <i>vọng cổ </i>musicians of Vietnam
  and the Vietnamese diaspora.</p>
