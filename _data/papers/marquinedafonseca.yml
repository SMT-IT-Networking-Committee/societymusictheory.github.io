  <p>In 1939, Claudio Santoro (1919–89) joined Música Viva, a group of composers
  led by the German composer Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, who, following a model
  from the Second Viennese School, found a school of modern music in Brazil in
  1939. Within the group’s output, Santoro’s Sonata 1942 for piano was most
  influential, as it established the twelve-tone technique into a viable musical
  language for avant-garde music within an environment marked by blatant
  nationalism in music (cf. Kater and Béhague). As a result, the activities of
  the group Música Viva resulted in a ferocious response from critics, the
  press, and the nationalist composers. Advocating for the continuation of a
  national style, Camargo Guarnieri responded to the group in his seminal
  <i>Carta Aberta</i> (Open Letter, 1950), where he questions the aesthetics of
  modernity as antithetical to the affirmation of a Brazilian musical
  identity.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that, as German musical modernism became a source of
  the Brazilian avant-garde through Koellreutter, Santoro paved the way for
  dodecaphonic serialism, one that eventually contributes to the Brazilian
  musical identity. I examine Santoro’s Sonata 1942 as a unique musical work
  that embodies the modern style advocated by Musica Viva, but in Santoro’s own
  idiosyncratic ways, particularly the handling of the series. Supplemented by
  his unpublished autobiographical interview, archival correspondences, and the
  music manuscript, Santoro’s approach to dodecaphony in the Sonata 1942 was
  fulfilled with a “lack of orthodoxy systematization”—a feature often
  criticized in the literature. I argue, however, that Santoro’s use of
  dodecaphony is systematic, and furthermore, his embodiment is dialectical in
  two levels: its embodiment of dodecaphony is fulfilled with a conscious level
  of serialism, but also has a direct connection with form, rhetoric, and
  musical expression, which exemplifies the genesis and the aesthetics of the
  avant-garde in Brazilian music.</p>
