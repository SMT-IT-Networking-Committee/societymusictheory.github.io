    <p>In this research, I turn toward musically improvising computers to unpack notions of creativity within 21st-century contemporary art music using American composer Pauline Oliveros’s Expanded Instrument System (EIS) as a case study. I allow for a creativity that is co-determined by a non-human, machinic agency, temporarily setting aside Lovelace’s famous assumption that machines cannot be creative. In order to do this, I rely on the method of actor-network theory (ANT), examining both human and non-human actors in terms of the natural and social networks of relations in which they exist and thereby assigns agency to all such actors. Through a close reading of the role of computer-improvisers in the music of Pauline Oliveros as performed by her close friend and collaborator, the flutist Claire Chase, I ask: how is creativity constructed in Oliveros’s context? How has software and hardware shaped and been shaped by that construction? As in this case study the notion of creativity is strictly tied to that of improvisation, I also question the relationship between the two. To conclude, I directly respond to recent developments in the theorization of the listening subject as put forth by musicologist Nina Eidsheim—namely, her proposal for a vibrational practice of listening in which “music is predominantly understood…as material and intermaterial vibration.” I argue that Eidsheim’s model breaks down in the face of computer temporalities that operate outside of, even beyond, the material here-and-now: indeed, any contemporary practice of listening must be pliable enough to capture the agency, however immaterial, of the listening machine.</p>
