        <p>Levi Walls is a third year PhD student in Music Theory at University of North Texas. His related field is English literature. His research interests include semiotics, literary theory, the intersection of music and literature, and voice-leading structure in 19th-century opera. He currently works as the editor of <em>Harmonia</em>, and is happy to attend this year's conference from home so that he doesn't have to leave his eight-month old daughter, Ophelia.</p>
        <p>I research how intuitions about “musicality” are modulated by a listener’s cultural commitments. That is, I consider the question: why are certain musical structures and performance practices considered “well-formed” or “expressive” by the standards of certain communities, while others are not? To address this question, I bring music analytical and ethnographic approaches together to delve into perceptions of musicality that have historically lain outside of the cultural purview of North American music theory. My dissertation centers around my fieldwork among <em>huangmei</em> opera and <em>koa-a</em> opera communities in China and Taiwan, respectively, from whom I study how notions of phrasal, tonal, and temporal logic can vary widely depending on one’s sociopolitical bearings and philosophical disposition. I use my platform as co-chair of the SMT Analysis of World Music Interest Group to advocate for the disciplinary inclusion of a far wider breadth of cultural frameworks. I am also a guest editor of <em>Engaging Students 8: “Beyond Western Musicalities</em>,<em>”</em> a special volume which reflects on the ethics and logistics of diversifying music theory pedagogy and provides open-source teaching modules that foreground repertoires and frameworks from beyond the West. I am currently a doctoral candidate in music theory at Harvard University. Before that, I obtained my B. Mus from McGill University with a double major in Piano Performance and Music Theory and Analysis.</p>

    <p>In this paper, I expand upon the terminology surrounding David Lawton’s concept of “double cycle”—a recurrent tonal structure within an opera that suggests a parallel between two parts of the narrative. A “global double cycle,” as I call it, is a parallel between the structure of the first act and that of the opera as a whole. A background structure in the first act that grows to embody the entire composition serves as an eloquent representation of fate, which the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus defined as the necessary conclusion brought about by a person’s character. Consequently, nineteenth-century operas dealing with fate sometimes feature a character-building phase (the opening act) that structurally mirrors the culmination (the work as a whole). This compositional technique takes its cues from the wider world of literature, in which the presence of fate is often alluded to through a beginning-ending parallelism—for instance, a thematic connection between the first and last sentences of a novel. After illustrating what a global double cycle looks like—using <em>Les Troyens</em> (1858) by Hector Berlioz as an example—I will consider the semiotic capabilities of a would-be global double cycle that fails to materialize. A “<em>damaged</em>-global double cycle”—my proposed term for a cycle with a marked flaw—can serve as a representation of averted fate, as it does in <em>La Esmeralda</em> (1836) by Louise Bertin.</p>
