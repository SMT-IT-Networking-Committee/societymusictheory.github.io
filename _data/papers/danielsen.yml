abstract: |
    <p>Rhythm and groove are at the heart of many African-American musical
    traditions. In this paper, I present examples of contemporary
    African-American popular music that have been produced through unorthodox
    application of the digital audio workstation, focusing on the ways in
    which creative use of technology has changed how music sounds. As part of
    this, I discuss how sound processing is used to manipulate the “width” of
    beats and change the perceived timing of rhythmic events.</p>
