abstract: |
  <p>The earliest <i>contrapunctus</i> treatises from the fourteenth century
  teach a compositional process in which one produces a note-against-note
  structural framework against a given tenor, then ornaments this framework to
  produce diminished counterpoint. Some of these treatises provide a series of
  examples of diminished counterpoint, but the process of elaboration is never
  explicitly described. However, by carefully analyzing the examples, we can
  observe the systematic process of ornamentation conveyed in these treatises to
  create elaborative figures. I will then present examples from contemporaneous
  motets by Vitry and Machaut in which we can observe many of these same
  elaborative figures, which function as stock patterns one could utilize in
  elaborating the <i>contrapunctus </i>structure. By understanding this
  compositional process and identifying these elaborative figurations in our
  analysis, we are better able to discern the underlying tonal structures
  operative in <i>Ars nova</i> motets.</p>
