    <p>The <i>Ivrea Codex</i>, one of the most important sources of <i>Ars
    nova</i> polyphony, contains an extensive repertory of motets, mass movements,
    and chansons. Among these works is the motet <i>Flos/Celsa</i>, attributed to
    Philippe de Vitry and composed upon the tenor “Quam magnus pontifex”
    celebrating the canonization of Louis of Toulouse, as well as a motet-style
    polyphonic Gloria (Ivrea 64) that was composed using the same isorhythmic
    tenor. This exceptional case provides a distinct opportunity to compare and
    contrast two approaches to organizing tonal structure.</p>
    <p>In my presentation, I combine my analytical methodology for distinguishing
    between the <i>contrapunctus</i> structure and its elaboration with theories
    of sonority progression (Fuller and Hartt) and cadential structure (Bain and
    Moll). This enables a more nuanced analysis of sonority by differentiating
    structural sonorities from elaborative sonorities, and this distinction aids
    further in discerning degrees of structural significance in directed
    progressions and cadences.</p>
    <p>With this resultant methodology, I analyze the large-scale tonal structures
    of <i>Flos/Celsa</i> and Gloria (Ivrea 64) to compare and contrast the
    organization of tonal structures upon the same tenor. We may observe points of
    similarity, which suggests structural techniques or strategies that were
    important to or valued by contemporaneous musicians. When the structural
    analysis of corresponding passages between the two pieces differs, we may
    consider what musical features lead us to analyze the passages as such,
    ultimately improving our analysis. Comparing these two compositions therefore
    provides a unique opportunity to delve into analyzing the large-scale tonal
    structures of <i>Ars nova</i> polyphony.</p>
