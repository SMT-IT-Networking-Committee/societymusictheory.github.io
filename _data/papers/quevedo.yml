abstract: |
    <p>In the decades following the 1959 Cuban Revolution the state established
    several cultural organizations that promoted revolutionary and socialist
    values. In the field of music certain composers employed experimental and
    avant-garde techniques with the goal of engaging the listener. Furthermore,
    they justified the use of these techniques in the service of an educational
    agenda aimed at developing the communist-revolutionary <i>hombre nuevo</i>
    (new man). Some composers argued in favor of musical experimentation as an
    ideal approach for promoting revolutionary values because this music
    challenged and elevated the listener.</p>
    <p>In this paper I explore the antecedents of these aesthetically
    avant-gardist and politically leftist activities during the 1950s through the
    Sociedad Cultural Nuestro Tiempo (Cultural Society of Our Time, SCNT). I
    specifically examine how and why SCNT musician members promoted new music
    throughout the 1950s. Focusing on the figures of Harold Gramatges and Juan
    Blanco (founding members of the SCNT), I analyze their published criticisms of
    the Cuban National Institute of Culture during Fulgencio Batista’s
    dictatorship, which, according to them, did little to promote contemporary,
    Cuban art. I examine two musical works by Blanco, <i>Cantata de la Paz</i>
    (1951) and the film music for <i>El mégano</i> (1955). I demonstrate how, in
    the years leading up to the 1959 Revolution, Blanco utilized an avant-gardist
    musical language in the service of leftist and socialist ideals. Through my
    readings of the criticism found in print media and the musical works, this
    paper sheds light on an artistic scene that has received little scholarly
    attention. Furthermore, this study serves as the foundation for examining the
    politically engaged avant-gardist music that was lauded by some socialist
    Cuban composers as emblematic of the Cuban Revolution after 1959.</p>
    <p>I situate the Cuban case within broader international networks and the
    growing field of Cold War and cultural politics studies. This study dialogues
    with the works of Cindy Bylander, Lisa Jakelski, Peter Schmelz, and Lisa
    Cooper Vest, who have examined avant-garde music in Poland and the Soviet
    bloc, as well as Danielle Fosler-Lussier’s and Carol A. Hess’s trailblazing
    monographs on music and US diplomacy in the Cold War.</p>
