abstract: |
  <p>Music of the Seattle-based artists THEESatisfaction (Stasia Mehschel Irons,
  a.k.a Stas THEE Boss, and Catherine “SassyBlack” Harris-White), DoNormaal, and
  Guayaba has been described variously as “hippie-hop,” “electronic psychedelic
  soul,” “psychedelic space-rap/jazz,” and “hologram funk,” and is exemplary of
  a global cross-genre pollination in recent electronic music production. In
  this talk, I show, first, how queer women of color have been visible as
  creators of electronic music, second, how these creators have worked to
  increase visibility of queer subjects through music, and third, I explore
  extensions of this legacy in the particular brand of hip hop emerging from the
  Pacific Northwest.</p>
