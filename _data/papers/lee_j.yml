    <p>The “Annunciation of Death,” a duet in Act 2, scene 4 of Wagner’s
    <i>Die Walküre</i>, is a dramatic turning point in the Ring Cycle. The
    warrior goddess Brünnhilde appears to the mortal Siegmund to deliver the
    chief god’s decree that he shall die in an upcoming battle; however, as
    Siegmund appeals for mercy for the sake of his sister-lover Sieglinde,
    Brünnhilde’s resolve weakens, and she decides to defy her orders and save
    him. Moreover, the sympathy and love she learns through their encounter
    ultimately motivates Brünnhilde to commit the sacrifice that redeems the
    world at the end of the Ring Cycle.</p>
    <p>The dramatic importance of this scene has attracted much attention from
    scholars; significant studies include analyses by Alfred Lorenz (1924),
    Robert Bailey (1977), Eero Tarasti (2012), and Karol Berger (2016). My
    paper revolves around the changing dramatic relationship between
    Brünnhilde and Siegmund over the course of the scene, and its reflection
    in the musical architecture.</p>
    <p>In my reading, the dramatic narrative is realized in rotational form,
    with each rotation led by “Siegmund’s Death Song”—a motive usually
    associated with Siegmund’s downfall. However, instead of treating the
    motive as a fixed signifier for Siegmund, I explore how the realization of
    the motive and the resulting progressive momentum in the playing-out of
    the rotational form reveal a shift between which character exercises
    control over the narrative. By tracing this narrative dynamic, the
    rotational form of the duet can be appraised not as a rigid organizational
    constraint, but as a drama-generating process.</p>
