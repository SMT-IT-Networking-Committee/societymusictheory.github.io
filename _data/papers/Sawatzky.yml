abstract: | 
    <p>Within the Western common-practice canon it is generally accepted that four-measure phrases are prototypical, and non-quadruple phrase lengths are transforms (expansion, overlap, etc.) of underlying quadruple prototypes. This paper asks: under what circumstances should four-measure normativity apply to/guide analysis of other tonal repertoires? That this question has not warranted much attention is evidence of the extent to which prevailing approaches to phrase rhythm are comfortable in accepting quadruple basic-phrases as a “natural” proportion with explanatory power for a wide range of tonal repertoires. </p>
    <p>This study considers an anthology of <em>Plautdietsch</em> (low-German) transcriptions collected from Mennonite communities in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early-20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Klassen, 1989). While four-measure structures abound, and about 2/3 of the melodies have a total number of measures that is a multiple of four, those factors, alone, are <em>not</em> sufficient evidence to conclude that all/most non-quadruple phrases derive from quadruple prototypes. By analyzing melodic grouping, gestalt segmentation, and melodic reductions, I demonstrate how an “irregular” tune’s phrase-rhythmic particularity can be meaningfully described without reference to quadruple prototype.</p>
    <p>To listeners familiar with the tonal common-practice idiom, the <em>Plautdietsch</em> folk-tunes likely sound relatively conventional. However, many of the peasant-farmer-<em>cum</em>-political-refugees who sang these tunes intentionally kept limited contact with the outside world, and thus had little direct knowledge of the notated music of 18<sup>th</sup>-century Europe—why should we assume phrase-length norms of that repertoire are relevant here? In assuming “naturalness” of four, we overlook or deny the relevance of novel forms and schemes that might better characterize this repertoire’s phrase-structural types. </p>
