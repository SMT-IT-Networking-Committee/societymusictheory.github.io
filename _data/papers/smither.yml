  <p>How might analysts engage the compositions on which jazz musicians
  improvise? Far from reading a fixed score, jazz musicians rely on what Paul
  Berliner has called “flexible conceptual maps” of tunes in order to free up
  enough attention to facilitate interactive improvisation. These maps take
  shape over time as musicians come into contact with more and more recordings,
  live performances, and written scores. For this reason, such maps can become
  both extremely complex and individualistic.</p>
  <p>In this talk, I argue that these conceptual maps are comprised of various
  underlying schemata. Using the schema theories of Robert O. Gjerdingen, I
  explore the analytic ramifications of a schematic understanding of jazz tunes.
  I begin by establishing a collection of schemata drawn from both the
  compositional and improvisational norms of jazz practice. Jazz musicians’
  conceptual maps of tunes may be understood as collections of these schemata,
  overlapping and interacting to furnish larger cyclical structures. Using
  several well-known recordings of these tunes as case studies, I explore how
  jazz musicians’ conceptual maps give rise to specific musical gestures and
  improvisational decisions. By representing an underlying conceptual
  abstraction, schematic maps provide a useful entryway for analysts who wish to
  engage the relationship between an improvised performance and the tune it is
  based on. The flexibility afforded by the schemata of these maps allows for
  individualistic interpretation as well as interactive divergence, opening a
  dialogic space where familiar conventions structure the musical
  conversation.</p>
