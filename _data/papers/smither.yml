    <p>Benjamin Givan has compared jazz improvisations to palimpsests, writing that improvised utterances “provide us with clues to the improviser’s underlying conception” of the tune being played (2002, 41). The sounding music represents a negotiation between extemporization and fixed text wherein it is not always clear which elements are “part of the tune” and which are improvised. While recent research has sought to better understand both what a jazz tune is (Born 2005; Kane 2018) and how such tunes may be analyzed (Stover 2013), the palimpsests that are jazz improvisations continue to pose problems for analysts due to the dense entanglement of improvised utterances with the referents (Pressing 1984) that underlie them. In this paper, I take Givan’s above observation as the starting point for a methodology that disentangles improvisations from the tunes with which they intersect. </p>
    <p>I begin by outlining a theory of referent defaults, prototypical features grounded in a tune’s performance network that represent an improviser’s understanding of the musical structure of the referent. Using nine recordings of Duke Ellington’s “Satin Doll” as a case study, I show how various segments of the musical surface may be understood to convey referent defaults in varying degrees. By examining the interplay between referent and improvisation, we can better account for the tune as both an inspiration for and constraint upon the sounding music. This methodology reconfigures the objects of jazz analysis, suggesting new ways of understanding the relationship between improvisation and referent in jazz practice and beyond. </p>
