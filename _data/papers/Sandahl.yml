    <p>There is an aesthetic dichotomy at work in the music of György Kurtág. On the one hand, fragmentation and incompletion play a role in his musical processes. However, one also detects integrating pressures in his work. I provide analyses that are motivated by these competing forces, suggesting that they be seen as complementary rather than mutually opposed ideals. My strategy is to provide multiple readings of the same work, each of which is incomplete on its own but related to the others at a higher level of abstraction.</p>
    <p>I analyze the soprano line in Death, III from <em>The Sayings of Péter Bornemisza</em>, first in terms of a nearly-symmetrical succession of pitch intervals, and later in terms of a compound interval cycle. Each reading accounts for all but one note of the line. The piano accompaniment provides these missing notes but in a manner that undermines the patterns established by the soprano line. I show how all of these partial readings might be subsumed into a further analysis involving transpositional combination.</p>
    <p>In <em>Officium breve</em>, movement III, I tease out the tensions between tonal and post-tonal musical processes. The piece nearly supports a tonal-prolongational reading, but this reading is undermined by dissonant minor ninths at the final cadence. I take up these dissonances as the basis for a post-tonal reading. By relating multiple incomplete analyses by means of their respective failures, I suggest that in Kurtág’s music notions of incompletion and unity are in dialectical relation to one another.</p>
