        <p>Daniel Walden is a Junior Research Fellow at The Queen’s College (Oxford) who combines music theory with the global history of science and society, postcolonial studies, and media theory. He received his PhD in 2019 from Harvard University, where he was a Presidential Scholar, and an MPhil in Music from University of Cambridge as a Gates Scholar. His current book project, <em>The Emperor’s New Keyboard: Just Intonation and the Global Politics of Tuning and Temperament,</em> examines how 19<sup>th</sup>-century keyboard-based epistemologies of music theory, listening techniques, and performance practices were co- produced with the structures of intellectual and bodily discipline that shaped imperialism and resistance. His PhD dissertation received 1<sup>st</sup> Honorable Mention in the 2020 IMS Outstanding Dissertation Award Competition, and his most recent publications appear in <em>The Oxford Handbook to Timbre, History of the Humanities, Early Music History</em>. He is also an experimental pianist. For more please visit <a href="http://www.danielwaldenpiano.com/"><span class="underline">www.danielwaldenpiano.com</span>.</a></p>

    <p>The Tonnetz has come to serve as an emblem of “Western” tonality through the work of theorists from Leonhard Euler to Brian Hyer. But how might a “global history” challenge our understanding of what it represents? The archetypal Tonnetz associated with Hugo Riemann was in fact adapted from a treatise by the Japanese theorist Tanaka Shōhei, in which it represented the tuning of the author’s “enharmonium,” a just-intonation keyboard marketed as a product of Japanese-German “geistigen Verkehr” (intellectual/spiritual exchange) that would rescue Europe from equal temperament. Thirty years later, the Tonnetz was reinterpreted by the Hindustani theorist G.S. Khare as a representation of Sanskrit tuning systems, reconceived as a bulwark against intrusive colonial tonalities. Neither could be distinguished at first glance from the Riemannian Tonnetz, making them potent political tools for accomplishing the political agendas of their authors: the defamiliarization of European musical practices with tuning systems that sounded almost the same but not quite (Bhabha 2012), and the provincialization of European musical history as a mere offshoot of an “Indo-Aryan” lineage chiefly preserved by Hindustani musicians (Chakrabarty 2009).</p>
    <p>I draw on postcolonial, STS, and critical media studies in tracing a global history attuned to the feedback loops of reciprocal influence that shaped “Western” and “non-Western” theoretical discourse. But I also consider two potential perils of global historiography: unilinear developmentalism and cultural relativism, discursive frameworks previously leveraged towards securing European centricity (Scherzinger 2018). Could these pitfalls be avoided by making defamiliarization and provincialization central to future histories of theory?</p>
