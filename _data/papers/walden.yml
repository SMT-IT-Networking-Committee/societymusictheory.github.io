    <p>The Tonnetz has come to serve as an emblem of “Western” tonality through the work of theorists from Leonhard Euler to Brian Hyer. But how might a “global history” challenge our understanding of what it represents? The archetypal Tonnetz associated with Hugo Riemann was in fact adapted from a treatise by the Japanese theorist Tanaka Shōhei, in which it represented the tuning of the author’s “enharmonium,” a just-intonation keyboard marketed as a product of Japanese-German “geistigen Verkehr” (intellectual/spiritual exchange) that would rescue Europe from equal temperament. Thirty years later, the Tonnetz was reinterpreted by the Hindustani theorist G.S. Khare as a representation of Sanskrit tuning systems, reconceived as a bulwark against intrusive colonial tonalities. Neither could be distinguished at first glance from the Riemannian Tonnetz, making them potent political tools for accomplishing the political agendas of their authors: the defamiliarization of European musical practices with tuning systems that sounded almost the same but not quite (Bhabha 2012), and the provincialization of European musical history as a mere offshoot of an “Indo-Aryan” lineage chiefly preserved by Hindustani musicians (Chakrabarty 2009).</p>
    <p>I draw on postcolonial, STS, and critical media studies in tracing a global history attuned to the feedback loops of reciprocal influence that shaped “Western” and “non-Western” theoretical discourse. But I also consider two potential perils of global historiography: unilinear developmentalism and cultural relativism, discursive frameworks previously leveraged towards securing European centricity (Scherzinger 2018). Could these pitfalls be avoided by making defamiliarization and provincialization central to future histories of theory?</p>
