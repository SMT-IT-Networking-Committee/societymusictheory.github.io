abstract: |
  <p>This paper suggests that the method for analyzing musical pitch developed by
  Alexander Ellis in his seminal article “On the Scales of Various Nations,”
  adopted enthusiastically by comparative musicologists and music theorists from
  the late nineteenth century onwards, has its origins in data collection
  techniques perfected by colonial bureaucracies. Ellis’s method aimed to
  represent musical systems from around the world in data by rendering them into
  scalar collections of specific frequencies, quantified in “cents.” Each system
  could then be catalogued and made available for cross-cultural comparison. I
  call this theoretical position “pitch fundamentalism,” and define it according
  to three principles: 1) that the identity of any musical sound can adequately
  be determined by its pitch; 2) that “pitch” is a universal parameter, defined
  on a physical basis by the frequency of its fundamental alone, and therefore
  necessarily separate from timbre, physical gesture, etc; 3) that the music
  theorists findings must be statistically robust, eliminating individual or
  local differences in performance practice as outlying data, and therefore
  contributing to an understanding of what constitutes national or regional
  musical norms. </p>
  <p>I propose that Ellis’s analyses can be connected to the contemporary
  practice of census-keeping on matters of sociological and economic importance.
  Cultural anthropologists (Cohen 1987, et al.) have shown that census-keeping
  was not a “neutral” act, for it required reducing a complex environment into
  sortable and quantifiable phenomena. Once reduced to data points, these
  phenomena could be analyzed and compared, allowing for the consolidation of
  political and social control and contributing to the construction and
  maintenance of an unequal society. I argue that the efforts to transform
  different musical traditions into scientific objects by breaking them apart
  into separate quantifiable parameters, all for the sake of comparative
  analysis, owes much to these census-keeping practices and is likewise far from
  politically neutral. The peril of pitch fundamentalism—and parametrical
  thinking in general—is that it significantly distorts our understanding of
  musical traditions while projecting itself as universal and non-judgmental. I
  close by suggesting the need to avoid both scientism and reductionism while
  paying sophisticated attention to matters of musical epistemology and
  ontology.</p>
