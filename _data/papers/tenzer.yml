    <p>Since 2000, Balinese composer Dewa Alit (b. 1973) has split his time
    between home and abroad, absorbing many kinds of music. His latest
    gamelan work (2016) is <i>Ngejuk Memedi, </i>from the
    Balinese <i>ngejuk, </i>to chase, and <i>memedi, </i>a feared phantom of
    the Balinese unseen world that takes human form. It animates Alit’s
    evolving desire to “see gamelan in a new way, in relation to other
    traditions” (Alit in Tenzer 2011), while submitting to the phantom-like
    elusiveness of the goal.</p>

    <p>Alit works less with inherited musical materials, and more with
    heuristics specially conceived.  Like contemporary composers elsewhere, he
    critiques the structures and procedures of his inherited classical
    tradition as overdetermined and spent, limiting the reach of new
    expression. He has thought his way through to a terse set
    of non-negotiable features—mallet techniques, intonations, interpart
    relations, rehearsal and performance sociality—minimal and sufficient
    to convey a bedrock Balineseness without constraining liberation from the
    past. And he has added material gleaned from his travels and
    imagination.</p>

    <p>Analyzing part of <i>Ngejuk Memedi, </i>I will portray an emergent
    supra-culturalism. By linking it to particular examples from elsewhere
    (Brazil, Israel, et al.), I characterize a global trend into which Alit
    has tapped, that comes into focus only once one delimits the
    intellectual and aesthetic desiderata certain musicians have challenged
    themselves to explore. These explorations are generating musics rooted in
    separate traditional practices but aspiring to global reach. Often notated
    by composers but transmitted and performed orally, such music is highly
    conceptual but deeply embodied in felt groove. Its signature element is
    the juxtaposition or layering of complex, asymmetrical periodicities that
    are rare or unknown in source traditions, but trace to ideas circulating
    from African, Indian, Western and other art musics that have become common
    currency. In these intersecting senses, they comprise a new
    phenomenon.</p>

    <p>Inquiries into music of this ilk could provide common cause for music
    theorists and ethnomusicologists, positioning them to receive future
    developments with insight. A key challenge for its analytical description
    is to represent the hyper-elastic groove sensations elicited by the flow
    of irregular periodicities in multiple misalignments with groups dispersed
    in stratified layers.</p>
