  <p>This paper focuses on the perception and cognition involved in music
  listening skills as essential criteria in selecting solmization systems.
  Drawing on the aural key-identification studies of Butler and Brown
  (summarized in Butler & Brown, 1994) and the model for music perception
  developed by Karpinski (1990) and formalized in Karpinski (2000), it concludes
  that the first and most fundamental process listeners carry out while
  attending to the pitches of tonal music is tonic inference. In addition, a
  tonic is inferable without reference to a complete diatonic pitch collection.
  Melodies that are unambiguous with regard to their tonic might never employ
  all seven diatonic pitch classes, they might state those pitch classes only
  gradually, or they might even change the collection without changing tonic.
  Nonetheless, listeners are able to infer tonics quickly and dynamically under
  any of the above conditions. According to Butler (1992, 119), “listeners make
  assessments of tonal center swiftly and apparently without conscious effort”
  certainly well in advance of inferring or perceiving entire diatonic pitch
  collections. This paper examines the means through which do-based minor
  moveable-do solmization most closely models this mental process and contrasts
  that with la-based minor and its inherent inability to model the pitches of a
  musical passage until all seven of its diatonic members are explicitly stated
  (or at least implicitly present). This is not to say that la-based minor is
  ineffective, but simply that do-based minor most closely reflects and
  represents the way listeners infer tonality.</p>
