abstract: |
  <p>In this presentation, I explore new contexts for understanding Joseph
  Haydn’s late oratorio, <i>Die Schöpfung</i>/<i>The Creation</i> (1798),
  suggesting that the work yields broader ramifications when examined beyond
  Christianity. Typically analyzed in terms of Roman Catholic (Austro-German)
  and Protestant (English, North German) theology—the main religious and
  language groups for whom this bilingual (English/German) oratorio was composed
  by Haydn and his librettist/translator, Gottfried van Swieten—rarely is the
  oratorio understood from the perspective of Judaism or Jewish listeners, or
  sacred mysticism. The libretto, based on the first two chapters of Genesis,
  selected passages from the biblical Psalms, and Book 7 of Milton’s <i>Paradise
  Lost</i>, invites consideration from a wider interpretive framework—one
  extending back to Handel’s Old Testament oratorios, as well as the
  intermediary role played by Johann Peter Salomon, the impresario who brought
  Haydn to London in 1791 and who, upon Haydn’s departure from London in 1795,
  presented the composer with a libretto entitled <i>The Creation of the
  World.</i> </p>
  <p>Examined in this paper are some of the ways in which <i>Die
  Schöpfung</i>/<i>The Creation</i> lends itself to and benefits from a more
  pluralistic and multisensory interpretive lens. Investigated in this paper
  are: 1) Haydn’s transnational experiences while traveling through continental
  Europe in late 1790 guided by Salomon, and their subsequent close working
  relationship in London; 2) the composer’s acquaintance with the writings of
  the late-eighteenth-century Jewish religious reformer Moses Mendelssohn; 3)
  Milton’s engagement with Hebrew scholarship and Judaic exegesis; 4) the
  oratorio’s prelapsarian conclusion—exemplifying Eve as teacher; 5) Haydn’s
  introduction to Handelian oratorio on Old Testament themes (e.g., <i>Israel in
  Egypt </i>and <i>The Messiah</i>) in 1790s London; and 6) Haydn’s experience
  writing an Orpheus opera during the French revolutionary period when debates
  were also raging about the place of the newly emerging citizen-Jew during the
  height of European Enlightenment cosmopolitanism and universal brotherhood. An
  increased appreciation of how this late-career oratorio resonates with Haydn’s
  expanding cultural horizons and those of the liberalizing communities and
  societies in which he lived and traversed suggest a growing awareness of the
  <i>creation of a new world</i> order.</p>
