title: "Merging the Sonata and the Concerto: Analysis of “Compositional” Improvisation in the High Classical Sonata"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>This presentation raises the issue of improvisational structures within
  masterworks of the High Classical period and reexamines the definition of
  “analyzing improvisation.” While the aesthetic of improvisation is often built
  into fantasia and concerto forms, I examine virtuosic passages within sonata
  form, which tend to resist analysis and blur the lines between compositional
  and improvisational domains. Part I first explores treatises by Koch (1793)
  and Galeazzi (1796), which prescribe possibilities for how composers might
  expand the second half of a sonata’s subordinate theme zone, analogous to an
  expanded Caplinian continuation (1998).</p>
  <p>Since the virtuosity within such an episode invokes rhetoric found in
  concertos, Part II inserts concerto perspectives into theories of (solo)
  sonata form, using Dahlhaus’s “display episode” (1991) as a point of
  departure. While his episode encompasses only solo works, Hepokoski and Darcy
  (2006) apply the same term exclusively to concerto expositions and
  recapitulations; their passages, however, are not loosely knit continuations
  within a larger sentential structure, but rather closed and autonomous
  structures that begin and end with a stable tonic. Their theory exposes an
  ambiguous and yet crucial point: the display episode may flexibly function
  within either the subordinate group or as part of the closing zone. The
  remainder of the paper showcases several examples in the solo piano sonata
  literature that highlight the display episode functioning in precisely the
  same manner as Hepokoski and Darcy’s concerto display episodes—sans orchestral
  accompaniment—thus becoming an integral part of the <i>Formenlehre</i>
  toolbox.</p>
