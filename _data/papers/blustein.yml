    <p>Music-analytical studies of songs from book musicals are generally work-centric. Such approaches prioritize musical meaning and interpretation through the dramatic context of a libretto, paralleling the critical valuation of the “integrated” musical. But musical theatre entertainment is considerably more varied than sitting down in a theatre for a live performance of a dramatic work. And for a canon that upholds stereotypes as much as it subverts them, performances that surpass the bounds established by mid-twentieth-century texts offer sites of potent and imaginative reengagement.</p>
    <p>In this paper I examine one such category of performances, using Dorothy Loudon’s “Losing My Mind/You Could Drive a Person Crazy” as a case study. Loudon’s medley turns Stephen Sondheim’s pastiche of Tin Pan Alley pathos in <em>Follies </em>on its head by switching back and forth with a solo rendition of an Andrews Sisters-style trio about a flaky beau in <em>Company</em>. A close reading of musical form shows how her performance lampoons patriarchal conceptions of hysteria<em> </em>in both songs, reframing an explicitly sincere and sentimental lyric with surprise and irony.</p>
    <p>Loudon’s performance is part of a broader practice of subverting expectations of the <em>torch song</em>—“freighted with gender and sex coded meanings” (Hubbs 1996)—through juxtaposition, alternating two affectively opposed songs into a newly constructed ternary form. These performances most often happen in cabarets, recitals, and concerts—beyond the Broadway stage, where play with musical form is much more rigidly codified—providing a liberating space to confront theatrical stereotypes and animate intersectional subtexts.</p>
