    <p>Dialogs between schema theory (Gjerdingen 1988, 2007) and Schenkerian theory have been adversarial (e.g., Agawu 1991; Lester 1990; Proctor 1989). However, analysis using schemata creates pitch reductions, which has led to some recent studies on theoretical intersections (Froebe 2014; Schwab-Felisch 2014; Rohringer 2015). Gjerdingen rejects “Schenker’s totalizing ideology of a transcendent tonality” and his German chauvinism (2007, 435) and describes the conventional schemata of eighteenth-century galant style. Moreover, in his central “<em>Il filo</em>” chapter, Gjerdingen models schema successions probabilistically, not based on an overarching linear of formal outline. Rabinovitch (2018) suggests that constraints on the organization of schemata within form (Byros 2015; Caplin 2015; Neuwirth 2020) might potentially lead to a reconstruction of <em>Urlinie</em>-like structures. Do typical schema successions within form lead to a somewhat consistent global linear model or to a variety of paths? </p>
    <p>I examine this dilemma through a sample of 27 first reprises of two-reprise movements from the 1740s. Despite its variability, the un-hierarchized skeletal outline that emerges from the concatenation of schemata resembles somewhat Schenkerian assumptions regarding the linear organization of a sonata exposition. A first reprise is, of course, not a sonata exposition but rather its predecessor (Ratner 1980; Greenberg 2017). However, due to the tight constraints on schema successions in this decade, it is a productive case study for the resultant global linear structure. Poster attendees are invited to speculate along with the author on the interaction of local and global musical factors in this typically galant repertoire.</p>
