  <p>Eighteenth-century performance practice had greater flexibility respective
  to the score than is customary today. Recent research on partimenti
  (Gjerdingen 2007; Sanguinetti 2012) reveals the central role of keyboard
  musicianship in learning the building blocks of the galant style. Moreover,
  improvisatory genres suggest that 18th-century European music fits along the
  continuum of fixity and flexibility in performance (Nettl 1974).</p>
  <p>C. P. E. Bach’s treatise and compositions represent a productive case
  study. Each part of his treatise (1753/1762) ends with a discussion of a
  practice that lies at one edge of the improvisation continuum: varied reprises
  (relatively fixed) and the fantasy (flexible). Moreover, Bach’s compositions
  can often be explained as successions of schemata (Gjerdingen 2007). The
  musical processes and structures associated with schemata require further
  theorizing, which resonates with Mavromatis’s (present session) hierarchical
  approach: schemata are medium-sized units that interact with surface formulas
  and with long-range formal pathways (Caplin 2015; Byros 2015).</p>
  <p>I focus on the sixth collection <i>für Kenner und Liebhaber</i> (1787),
  which contains tightly-scripted sonatas, free fantasies, and rondos that lie
  between them. By tracking the concatenation of schemata within form, I
  speculate on the potential role of schemata in improvisation: in fantasies,
  the minimal constraints facilitate spontaneity; in sonatas, the limited formal
  pathways for schema concatenation reduce the cognitive load on the improviser,
  as discussed by Mavromatis. By considering the continuum of Bach’s
  musicianship and the role of schemata, we gain a vantage point on the possible
  role of these building blocks in improvisation or rapid composition
  (Gjerdingen 2007).</p>
