  <p>Fixing sound in measured time according to a system of patterned rhythms
  offered musicians of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries a new set of
  compositional parameters to explore. The sheer extent and variety of the
  <i>clausula</i> repertories preserved in the major sources of Notre Dame
  polyphony suggests those parameters captured the imaginations of Parisian
  <i>organistae</i> for decades. The <i>clausula</i>, it would seem, was a
  premier site for rhythmic experimentation. </p>
  <p>One specific group of <i>clausulae</i> provide particularly interesting
  examples of the manipulation of rhythmic possibilities. Among the
  <i>clausulae</i> that are preserved with versions in at least two of the three
  main sources of this repertory (W1, F, and W2), there are nineteen pieces in
  which the rhythmic mode of the <i>clausula</i> has been notated differently
  between manuscripts. This rhythmic phenomenon is most commonly referred to by
  commentators as “modal transmutation.” First detected by Friedrich Ludwig in
  1910, the rhythmic behaviors of these nineteen <i>clausulae</i> have been the
  focus of a number of studies, including those by Luther Dittmer, Rudolf
  Flotzinger, Rebecca Baltzer, and Vincent Corrigan. </p>
  <p>Where previous scholarship on these pieces looked to modal difference
  (including mutation) and notational orthographies in order to establish
  chronological layers in the repertory, this paper will pursue a different
  goal. I will re-examine these “mutating” <i>clausulae</i> and demonstrate that
  they provide vivid examples of the compositional play that characterizes the
  repertory of discant more generally. Specifically, we shall follow this
  musical experimentation by analyzing the ways musicians tested and tinkered
  with rhythm and its notation. Play with rhythmic behaviors, I will suggest, is
  more foundational and far-reaching in this repertory than previously
  acknowledged, and not necessarily a determining feature of chronology. The
  interacting work of singers and scribes—of oral and written domains—and the
  significance of sounding memories in practice will provide the fundament for
  my analysis. From this basis, my paper aims to account for the imaginative
  ways musicians created and recast polyphony as they manipulated modal patterns
  and explored compositional possibilities across rhythmic modes.</p>
