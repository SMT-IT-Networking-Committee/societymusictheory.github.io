abstract: |
    <p>Johann David Heinichen’s treatise, <i>Der General-Bass in der
    Composition</i> (Dresden, 1728), is the most comprehensive study of
    thoroughbass ever written, yet it has been continually overshadowed in
    historical accounts by two works published in the same decade: Rameau’s
    <i>Traité de l’Harmonie</i> (1722) and Fux’s <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>
    (1725). Despite receiving some attention by Buelow (1966) and Holtmeier
    (2007), it seems <i>Der General-Bass</i> has yet to receive wider acclaim
    because it lacks a reductive pedagogical framework that can rival Rameau’s
    <i>basse fondamentale</i> or Fux’s species in simplicity and immediate
    appeal. Fortunately, the “partimento renaissance” of the last decade has
    brought renewed attention to the centrality of thoroughbass in
    18th-century music-making. Thus, the time is ripe for a reappraisal of
    Heinichen’s monumental work. At least once, Heinichen does in fact outline
    a pedagogical method of eminent simplicity on par with Rameau’s and Fux’s
    theories: his four-step instruction in how to improvise a prelude at the
    keyboard. These four steps toward Parnassus build in complexity by
    permuting two factors: (1) conjunct vs. disjunct basslines with (2)
    consonant vs. dissonant harmonies. According to Heinichen, this method,
    which seems to be completely unknown today, is to be understood not only
    as instruction in improvising, but also as training for beginning
    composers. Therefore, in explicating the pedagogy of one of 18th-century
    Europe’s leading composer-theorists, this paper makes a contribution to
    both the historically-informed analysis and the practical instruction of
    baroque music today.</p>
