abstract: |
    <p>According to Emanuel Bach, his father used figured-bass chorales to
    teach harmony: first, students added alto and tenor voices to a given
    outer-voice framework; next, students composed their own basslines. Robin
    Leaver recently identified a new source which likely originates from J. S.
    Bach’s students in Dresden, c. 1740. The anonymous manuscript, dubbed the
    <i>Sibley Choralbuch</i>, contains 236 chorales with outer voices and figures.
    Therefore, this source likely documents the first stage of Bach’s teaching
    method. I will use a variety of eighteenth-century German sources to
    reconstruct Bach’s pedagogy in detail.</p>

    <p>We might think to use Bach’s published four-voice chorales as models,
    but these are vocal, not keyboard works—Emanuel Bach reduced them from
    four to two staves for ease of reading at the keyboard. This format has
    led to confusion between Bach’s vocal and keyboard styles of
    harmonization. The <i>Sibley Choralbuch </i>implies that there was a
    simpler, keyboard-based Bach chorale tradition, which formed the starting
    point in Bach’s pedagogy. I argue that the goal of Bach’s method was to
    bridge from the simpler, keyboard style to the more complex, vocal style.
    As evidence, I cite among other things the multiple-bass chorale tradition
    of Bach’s students, Kittel and Kirnberger, where each bassline becomes
    increasingly ornate.</p>

    <p>After chorales, Bach introduced fugue. This ordering suggests he
    believed contrapuntal thinking depends on a foundation of figured-bass
    harmony. This harmony-centered perspective informs our understanding of
    Bach’s music and encourages us to reconsider our own teaching methods.</p>
