abstract: | 
    <p>The interpretation of musical topics when imported into new contexts involves generalizing from specific indexical aspects to broader cultural meanings. There is a risk, however, of overgeneralizing the cultural associations of vernacular idioms that are peripheral to mainstream traditions. In the case of Spanish art music, Eurocentric taxonomies of topical universes broadly account for “Spanish style” as essentialized “local color,” thus ignoring specific folk genres that have their own histories and meanings as preserved during topical formation. </p>
    <p>In this paper, I argue that the two flamenco <em>palos</em> known as <em>farruca</em> and <em>garrotín</em>, genres that are often subsumed under a broader “Spanish style,” may be more productively understood as separate yet related topical signifiers embedded in the political discourse of early 20<sup>th</sup>-century Spain. First, I define the boundaries of topical identification by evaluating the conventions by which modernist Spanish composers have come to represent these vernacular genres in their art music. Here, I identify and hierarchize constituent features of the topics based on the potential of each characteristic to signify the specific <em>palo,</em> and then classify each token according to its level of abstraction. Second, I present the <em>farruca</em> and <em>garrotín</em> as racialized topics of modernist primitivism, claiming that the two <em>palos</em> were flamenco adaptations of the African American cakewalk that reinforced the alleged “Blackness” of the Spanish Gitano (Goldberg 2015). I conclude with a topical interpretation of Joaquín Turina’s <em>Ritmos</em> (1928) that reads the interplay of these two vernacular topics against the racially charged anti-<em>flamenquista</em> sentiment in Madrid (Llano 2018). </p>
