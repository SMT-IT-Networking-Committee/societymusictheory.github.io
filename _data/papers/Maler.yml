    <p>Music created and performed in a visual-kinesthetic or tactile modality presents challenges for our existing methodologies in the field of music theory. In this paper, I explore the concept of melody in signed music, showing how sign-language musicians associate relationships in the signing space to relationships in the melodic realm. Existing theories of melody are largely based on the notion that melody involves pitch, but signed music does not necessarily involve sounding pitch. Is the concept of melody still useful or informative for understanding and analyzing music in a visual-kinesthetic modality? I argue that melody remains central to signed music, and that sign musicians use directionality of movement, location of signs, holds, movement size, and movement duration in order to establish kinetic lines that are equivalent to melodic lines in aural music. By defining signed melody in terms of common melodic competence (Stefani 1987), I further identify three key elements of signing melodic behavior: periodic duration, rise-growth-fall curve, and continuous movement. </p>
    <p>Through analyses of signed songs created by a wide variety of Deaf musicians, this talk traces important trends in the creation of melodic lines across signed music traditions. The examples range from early percussion songs like “Boat, Drink, Fun, Enjoy,” to arrangements of the national anthem, to popular songs like Rosa Lee Timm’s signed arrangement of Carrie Underwood’s “Blown Away.” In analyzing these works, I create a framework for understanding how signed music creates both single melodic lines and polyphonic relationships in this important and undertheorized musical genre.</p>
