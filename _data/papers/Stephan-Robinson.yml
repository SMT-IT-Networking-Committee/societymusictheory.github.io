abstract: | 
    <p>Notwithstanding new resources such as Music Theory Examples by Women and the Composers of Color Resource Project, it remains a challenge to obtain readily usable scores and recordings of music not written by white men. My poster features the music of Katherine Ruth Heyman (ca. 1872-1944), a white, American woman who wrote at least seventy compositions as well as a theoretical treatise. I present selected songs for solo voice and piano, composed over a 22-year span. The musically diverse compositions in this group can exemplify many theoretical concepts, ranging from basic first-year content such as simple/compound meter, interval identification, and diatonic harmony to more advanced topics such as symmetrical scales, extended and non-tertian harmony, and unmetered music. I will share an extensive annotated score packet and high-quality recordings (both licensed under Creative Commons) upon request.</p>
    <p>Heyman’s professional circle included many illustrious figures, but she has fallen into obscurity. To the extent that she is remembered, it is as a pianist who championed the music of Scriabin and as the founder of the society dedicated to that composer. With the exception of Poriss (1998), scholars have considered Heyman exclusively in the roles of performer (of Scriabin) and muse (to Ezra Pound). Furthermore, until I produced a recording of fourteen of her songs, no recordings of her music existed. Heyman’s music is thus an exciting untapped resource for study.</p>
