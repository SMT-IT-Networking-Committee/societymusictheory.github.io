title: "Timbral Function in <i>Klangflächetechnik</i>"

abstract: |
  <p>The <i>Klangfläche</i>, or sound sheet, is a potent and rich
  compositional device that facilitates new ways of thinking about and
  analyzing musical timbre. Rarely discussed in English-language scholarship,
  it is traditionally considered from a harmonic standpoint. Monika
  Lichtenfeld, who coined the term in her 1970 essay, “Zur technik der
  Klangflächenkomposition bei Wagner,” as well as Carl Dahlhaus, argue for a
  negatively framed understanding of the technique based primarily on
  non-chord tones and pitches extrinsic to the underlying harmony. Timbral
  function, however, can be decisive for interpreting this music and can force
  us to reconsider our harmonic assumptions. Building on Lichtenfeld and
  Dahlhaus’s formulations of <i>Klangflächen</i>, I reformulate the technique
  through the lens of timbre, and show that timbre often challenges harmonic
  considerations. </p>
  <p><i>Klangfläche</i> technique evolved along two paths during the late
  nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, both with timbre at their core.
  First, vis-à-vis common practice tonality, I consider the music of Gustav
  Mahler and Richard Strauss. The <i>Klangflächen</i> of Mahler and Strauss
  illustrate that compositional parameters such as timbre, registral placement,
  and tempo, may take precedence over the traditional parameters of pitch and
  harmony in determining what is part of the underlying harmonic progression or
  teleological progress of the work. Rather than frame the extrinsic sonorities
  negatively as exempted from organic development, I formulate them positively
  as independent, non-teleological entities within a framework of the
  teleologically composed world. Second, I show that Arnold Schoenberg’s seminal
  <i>Fünf Orchesterstücke</i> op. 16, no. 3, “Farben,” can be interpreted as a
  <i>Klangfläche</i>. Through this reading, pitch classes, musical gestures, and
  timbral events in “Farben” can be explained as harmonic/static/teleological
  and non-harmonic/active/non-teleological musical events. Schoenberg’s use of
  <i>Klangfläche</i> technique became a foundational moment in post-tonal
  twentieth-century music, providing the impetus for numerous works and
  compositional trajectories.</p>
