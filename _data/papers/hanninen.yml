abstract: |
    <p>When we think of music, we think primarily of sound. But musical experience is multifaceted and multimodal. Music performance, in particular, engages multiple faculties—aural, intellectual, visual, and kinesthetic. Musicians not only hear, but <em>feel,</em> sounds, as a complex choreography of precise physical actions, and qualities and dynamics of motion. This paper explores the grains and flows of somaesthetic experience (Shusterman 2012) that I call <em>musical feels</em> and illustrates how these might be incorporated in music analysis.</p>
    <p>Part I identifies the phenomenon and considers framing issues of ontology, language, and first-person research methods. Musical feels are multimodal qualia—amalgams of sound, structure, sight or visual imagery, touch, and somatic and dynamic qualities of movement. I explain how musical feels intersect with but differ from musical gesture, musical feelings or emotions, and objective, measurable aspects of movement. Like Boretz’s (1989) “determinate feels,” musical feels are radically particular and subjective. But if we investigate feels carefully and speak clearly, they can be surprisingly intersubjective and so might be meaningfully included in music analysis.</p>
    <p>Part II presents detailed analyses of the workings of several (for me, a pianist) especially intense musical feels. One is in the second movement of Bach’s Italian Concerto. Others come from works by Scarlatti, Brahms, and Berg. Paradoxically, the import of this paper lies not so much in the musical feels I discuss, as in those I cannot yet discuss, but hope to evoke and bring to vivid attention: they are yours and those of every other musician.</p>
