  <p>Music typically speaks of what is happening now. A newly composed piece
  might provoke one to remember something prior to it, by way of external
  references or internal recurrences. But presently unfolding musical discourse,
  yet unfinished, is the context in which an aural presence sounds as if past.
  Carolyn Abbate popularized the linguistic metaphor of a musical “past tense”
  when she argued music cannot constitute or project events as past (<i>Unsung
  Voices</i>, 53). Music expresses its meaning in a present immediacy. Despite
  troubles around tensing time, I concur with Abbate’s suggestion that musical
  discourse is stuck in a presentness, though only if one remains within her
  study’s limit of authorial inscriptions. In addition to the object-based time
  a composer marks in her score, there exists a subject-based time a listener
  experiences. The latter concerns the temporal distance necessary for a subject
  to reconstitute her experiences into a narrative. Recently in music studies,
  Naomi Waltham-Smith (2017) has explored this temporality in her account of
  “the time it takes to listen,” a third time in the midst of immediate musical
  experience and temporally extended structural understanding.</p>
  <p>The concepts of subjective time and musical pastness I bring to bear on the
  case of opera revivals. In 1840s Paris, Adolphe Adam reorchestrated a series
  of pre-Restoration opéras-comiques, then considered outdated, for revival
  productions at the Opéra-Comique. I argue these temporal hybrids,
  simultaneously old and new, condition the possibility to hear newly composed
  musical material as a narrative entirely of past events. My case study is a
  retouched score of Nicolò Isouard’s <i>Cendrillon</i> (1810) which the
  Opéra-Comique reprised in 1845. For a primed listener, Adam’s actually
  sounding music plays against the mute but attended sound of a past musical
  world, closed off to the listener’s lived present. Through the voice of Adam’s
  new orchestration, one hears a narrative of already-happened musical events,
  constituting what Abbate’s framework might consider a musical past tense.</p>
