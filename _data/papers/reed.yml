    <p>Moore (1995), Biamonte (2010), and De Clercq and Temperley (2011) explore subtonic harmony in rock, but do not acknowledge <strong>ę</strong>VII as a goal in deceptive cadences. I catalogue a dozen familiar examples and situate the cadence within a new class of motion (“sub-circle”).</p>
    <p>First, in this cadence, the melodic stratum achieves tonic closure while accompanimental strata move to <strong>ę</strong>VII, marking an arrival that functions deceptively. Collectively it resembles <strong>ę</strong>VII<sup>add9</sup>, though it is better understood as two processes than a single “chord.”</p>
    <p>Second, I generalize the cadence within a class of stratified motion common to recent popular music. Specifically, this class comprises progressions wherein the melody is consonant with (and suggests) circle-of-fifths root motion (+P4) from one accompanying major triad to the next, but the harmonic layer’s root moves up instead by a minor third (+m3). Because the new chord has a local subtonic relationship to the expected root, I call this behavior <em>sub-circle motion</em>. This necessarily creates a stratification between the melodic layer and harmonic and bass layers. From well-known songs, I cite examples of every sub-circle paradigm. This previously untheorized move is shown as grammatical in popular music. It is an idiom of the melodic-harmonic divorce via Temperley (2007)—and specifically of syntax divorce, per Nobile (2015).</p>
