    <p>Scholars of phrase rhythm have examined various relationships between hypermeasures and melodic groups. However, not all theoretically possible phrase-rhythmic patterns have received adequate attention. Drawing from Chopin’s Ballades and Scherzos, I illuminate in this paper some hitherto unexplored phrase-rhythmic types and their interaction with the more familiar types. </p>
    <p>The two most discussed phrase-rhythmic types in the existing literature are beginning- and end-accented rhythms, respectively denoted as 1–2–3–4 and 2–3–4–1 (Rothstein 2011, Ito 2013). Two other possible rotations, 3–4–1–2 and 4–1–2–3, have received some consideration as well (McKee 2004, Ng 2021). Additionally, when a phrase is extended, the resulting five-hyperbeat pattern 1–2–3–4–1 features both beginning-and end-accented characteristics at the same time, and Ng (2021) calls this “mixed rhythm.” </p>
    <p>I expand the possibilities for mixed rhythms beyond the 1–2–3–4–1 type to 2–3–4–1–2, 3–4–1–2–3, and 4–1–2–3–4, and argue that these four mixed rhythms play two crucial roles in Chopin’s form. Mixed rhythms either delineate thematic zones in conjunction with a cadence or give rise to irregular melodic groups. In the latter case, mixed rhythms interact with not only four-, but also three-, and even five-hyperbeat patterns without interfering with the prevailing quadruple hypermeter. In order to demonstrate the interplay between mixed rhythms and familiar phrase-rhythmic types, I propose what I call a “Pandora space,” which expands Ng’s cyclic space by interspersing the four mixed rhythms among the four-hyperbeat patterns. </p>
