abstract: |
  <p>Over the course of the past decade, a collaborative multi-stylistic scene
  of experimental musicians has emerged in São Paulo, Brazil. The participants
  in this scene hail from a wide range of backgrounds, from free improvisation
  to electroacoustic composition to local styles such as capoeira and
  <i>forró</i>. Today, these individuals operate in a matrix of independently
  directed creative organizations and performance establishments dedicated to
  the production of unorthodox sound and performance free from dominant
  institutional restrictions. They employ the label “experimental music”
  strategically, as an umbrella term meant to encompass diverse stylistic idioms
  under the same conceptual roof and facilitate their mixture in performance.
  Members of the scene employ a creative model principally derived not from the
  compositional practice of John Cage or the hybrid sounds of Brazilian
  Tropicália, but from the antiauthoritarian attitude and do-it-yourself (DIY)
  ethos pioneered by punk and post-punk bands such as Black Flag and Fugazi. In
  so doing, they confound conventional understandings of musical experimentalism
  that privilege European and American composition and exclude the contributions
  of independent and popular practices (e.g. Nicholls 2007; Saunders 2016).</p>
  <p>Drawing from over a year of ethnographic research, in this paper I employ
  the São Paulo scene as a means of investigating an understudied, yet central
  motivational factor in fostering innovative creativity and shaping
  contemporary musical experimentalism: the DIY ethos pioneered in punk culture.
  The paper begins with a historical consideration of how international punk and
  post-punk musicians created a model for radically reinventing dominant
  creative paradigms. Then, using the São Paulo scene as a case study, I discuss
  three primary factors in punk musical culture that facilitate experimental
  musical innovation: an emphasis on initiative and collective action, a
  celebration of amateur music-making and lay practice, and an oppositional
  stance oriented towards disrupting established institutions and aesthetic
  standards. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ramifications of punk
  and DIY for future studies of musical experimentalism, thus contributing to a
  growing scholarly effort (Lewis 2008; Piekut 2011, 2014) towards creating a
  more inclusive canon of experimental music.</p>
