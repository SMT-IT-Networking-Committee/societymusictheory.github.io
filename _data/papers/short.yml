    <p>“A-five, six, seven, eight!” Those four numbers in the opening of <i>A
    Chorus Line</i> (1976) often announce the beginning of musical theatre
    dance routines. Choreographic phrases often follow an 8-beat paradigm to
    match the larger musical hypermeter. However, more complex rhythmic
    structures are commonly found in Broadway choreography, where steps and
    groups of steps do not closely align with musical phrases. These “Dance
    Hemiolas,” as I term them, usually occur near places of formal delineation
    in the music. Tap dancing intensifies this potential metric “dissonance”
    (following Krebs, 1999) as sounds created by the dancers’ shoes create
    another rhythmic instrumental layer. Changes in the relationships between
    the metrical layers can create heightened energy. This paper explores
    examples from two Broadway-style tap dance breaks to show how Dance
    Hemiolas combine with musical rhythms to generate momentum and delineate
    formal structures.</p>
    <p>In the 1992 musical <i>Crazy For You</i> with music by George Gershwin,
    Susan Stroman’s choreography uses traditional tap dance steps in classic
    and new ways, featuring many Dance Hemiolas at structural positions. In
    the finale to <i>Billy Elliot Live</i> (2005/2014), the rousing conclusion
    of the dance break is created by accumulating dancers, repetition of
    groups of simple steps, and Dance Hemiolas. These examples show how
    dancers’ on-stage movements and rhythmic tap sounds combine with musical
    rhythms and phrases to create energy and strengthen structural climaxes.
    By showing analytical insights gained from a closer look at choreo-musical
    rhythmic movements, this paper offers an innovative investigative tool for
    scholars who seek multivalent understanding.</p>
