abstract: |
  <p>Composer and acoustic ecologist R. Murray Schafer is known for his
  environmentalist stance. Schafer attributes the decline in the health of the
  global soundscape to developments in technology since the Industrial
  Revolution. In his writing as well as his music, Schafer looks to the past to
  find hope for the future. To bring back that soundscape we must, according to
  Schafer, re-condition ourselves to the natural world and re-design acoustic
  space accordingly. </p>
  <p>For Schafer, the activation of echoes in an outdoor wilderness setting is
  one step in the process of restoring the “original” soundscape. By resounding
  live musical sounds in a natural environment, echo closes the sense of space
  between performers—and arguably listeners—and the surrounding terrain. This
  paper examines the aesthetics of echo in <i>The Princess of the Stars</i>
  (1981), one of Schafer’s most well-known outdoor compositions. I give
  particular attention to “Aria of the Princess,” the unaccompanied solo for
  soprano or mezzo-soprano that bookends the work. The aria is based on a
  wedge-shaped all-interval row. As the intervals expand by semitone the singer
  activates a variety of echoes, and as the intervals close back those same
  echoes are stimulated, but gradually narrow in scope. In addition to interval
  and pitch, the soloist explores outdoor acoustics using particular vowel
  sounds as well as varying pause lengths between sung passages. </p>
  <p>Other scholars have considered the collaboration between musicians and the
  physical world in Schafer’s works, and have linked performer-environment
  interaction with Canadian identity and environmentalism. However, the role and
  meaning of outdoor acoustics in Schafer’s music remains understudied. Through
  score and recording analysis, this paper illuminates how Schafer’s use of echo
  in <i>The Princess of the Stars</i> exemplifies his idea of recovering the
  past. Echo not only throws an “original” sound back from a surface, but also
  offers insight into the role that musical sounds play in prescribing
  interpretation of nature and our human place within it. </p>
