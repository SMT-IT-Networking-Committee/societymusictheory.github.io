abstract: |
  <p>Global hip hop scholarship often takes for granted that musicians identify
  with hip hop’s origin narratives of 1970s Afro-diasporic Caribbean and US
  cultural circuits. Most work on hip hop in the Middle East and North Africa in
  particular assumes participants’ identification with this lineage, often
  through a shared politics of resistance. Yet recent scholarship on rap in this
  region has begun to question the equation of Arabic rap with political
  resistance (McDonald 2013, El Zein 2016, Sprengel forthcoming). My research in
  the hip hop scene of Beirut, Lebanon builds on this scholarship to ask: what
  happens when we listen without assuming resistance or a connection to the
  genre’s Afro-diasporic origins?</p>
  <p>In this paper, I consider two contemporary rappers’ efforts to ground hip
  hop in an indigenous lineage of Arabic language and gesture: El Rass (“The
  Head”) from Tripoli and Darwish from Aleppo, Syria have formed a circle of
  artists in Beirut committed to an Arabic language hip hop that bears little
  reference to global icons of hip hop like Tupac or Kanye. Based on twelve
  months of ethnographic fieldwork in Beirut and close listenings to albums and
  one-off tracks by these artists and their associates, this paper considers
  what kind of hip hop emerges in the work of El Rass and Darwish by examining
  three main avenues: mixing registers of language, often with prominent
  quotations and allusions from Islamic and Islamicate intellectual traditions;
  sampling of Arabic-language “old media” including sounds of radio, film, and
  television; and use of local and regional gestures in their live
  performances.</p>
  <p>This paper decenters the normative politics of resistance that runs
  throughout much hip hop scholarship to make space for the distinct lyrical
  wordplay, compositional techniques, and gestural vocabulary characterizing
  this Beirut circle of artists. I argue that the politics these artists perform
  are regionally directed, emotionally coded, and lateral, aimed at embracing
  contradictions of Arabo-Islamic modernity rather than resisting a global
  order. Through my analysis, I contribute to alternative narratives of hip hop
  that acknowledge the importance of widely circulating origin stories while
  insisting on the genre’s flexibility as a tool for meaning-making.</p>
