abstract: |
  <p>In her 1899 pedagogy manual <i>Touch: Piano Instruction on the Basis of
  Physiology</i>, composer and pianist Marie Jaëll describes musical “touch” as
  a “polyphony of sensations,” a synthesis of vibrations that is both physical
  and psychical. Developing virtuosity, she contends, necessitates a pianist’s
  attention to haptic and aural impulses in an elusive, “simultaneous and
  successive” process. For Jaëll, touch collates two divergent phenomena: the
  pianist’s tangible sensation of the keyboard, and the ineffable mental
  impressions conjured by sound. Moreover, she asserts that this braided sense
  of musical touch can be cultivated in performers and transmitted to listeners.
  Jaëll makes this assertion using a novel kind of visual evidence:
      fingerprints. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I examine Jaëll’s theory of touch in light of
  nineteenth-century experimental psychology. Fingerprinting her students before
  and after the execution of selected piano etudes, Jaëll illustrates how
  attending to minute variations in touch is akin to attuning to the aesthetic
  content of a musical work. As Kursell (2011) has shown, Jaëll crystallized her
  methodology in a vibrant collaboration with Charles Féré, a criminologist and
  one-time student of Jean-Martin Charcot. More broadly, Jaëll’s treatise is an
  exponent of the era’s “graphical method,” pioneered by Étienne-Jules Marey,
  which sought to supplant scientific rhetoric with “objective” truth, depicted
  as machine-generated wave forms (Daston and Galison 1992; Brain 2015). The
  ethos that motivated such representations, propagated by an array of
  scientists, including E. H. Weber and Helmholtz, underscores a tendency to
  intertwine physiology and psychology in an enterprise that quantified
  sensation as a fact of mechanistic causes (Schmidgen 2005; Bergeron 2010;
  Steege 2012).</p>
  <p>Crucially, I argue that Jaëll’s emphasis on attention—how thought modifies
  touch and sound—sets her theory apart from experimental psychology’s more
  determinist premises. In Jaëll’s experimental apparatus, fingerprints are not
  objective; rather, they index the intertwining of haptic and sonic sensations
  in the pianist’s consciousness. As a nascent theory of embodied cognition,
  Jaëll’s pedagogy is thus redolent of a more permeable border between mind and
  body at the dawn of the twentieth century.</p>
