Color/Tone Color Metaphor"

    <p>The metaphorical relationship between sound and color has a rich and
    fascinating history within Western musical thought. In this paper, I
    address music theoretical and occult versions of the timbre-color metaphor
    and apply these considerations to Schoenberg’s <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>,
    providing new support for Cramer’s (2000) reevaluation of this concept
    through examination of Schoenberg’s links with the color/tone color
    metaphor in contemporary occult culture.</p>
    <p>I argue that critical subtleties of the color/tone color metaphor
    became masked by the way that early music science defined timbre as one of
    three separable dimensions of a tone, alongside pitch and loudness. I
    identify a more complex perspective on tone color from the 19th century
    and earlier, where timbral changes are considered as covarying with
    register, and call on the language of color, imposing visual properties on
    the realm of sound.</p>
    <p>The second half of this paper examines how the history of the
    color/tone color metaphor relates to <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>, building
    on Cramer’s (2002) contention that <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> was
    originally conceived to involve the perception of the timbral colorings of
    frequencies. I explore how the history of the color/tone color metaphor
    relates to Schoenberg’s definition of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> and lends
    new support to Cramer’s reading.</p>
    <p>Finally, I propose another layer of historical and cultural context
    that enriches our understanding of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>: Schoenberg’s
    influences link him to occult traditions (Covach 1992) that held
    relationships between sound and color in high regard. These considerations
    affect the interpretation of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> and exemplify how
    historical perspectives on metaphors can inform music theoretical
    concepts.</p>
