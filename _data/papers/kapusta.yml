  <p>“It is only irritating to think one would like to be somewhere else. Here
  we are now.” (John Cage, “Lecture on Nothing.”) So read the epigraph of
  Christopher Lasch’s 1979 best-selling critique of life in the modern-day
  United States, <i>The Culture of Narcissism</i>. There, Lasch argued that the
  contemporary “awareness movement”—with its love of yoga, meditation, and
  experience in the “here and now”—had created a hopelessly inward-facing
  culture. </p>
  <p>When Lasch blamed postwar musicians for the apparent indulgences of the
  seventies, he was probably more right than he knew. But, like many later
  musicologists, Lasch overemphasized Cage’s influence. In this paper, I show
  how self-described bodywork practitioners active in the early postwar years
  transformed music-making into an “awareness” discipline, and how their
  approach to the body inspired performing artists from soprano Jan DeGaetani to
  composer Pauline Oliveros. I focus on two pedagogues active at the Esalen
  Institute in Big Sur, California, Charlotte Selver and Kay Ortmans. These
  pedagogues, I argue, helped to create a network of newly “aware” US performing
  artists, laid the groundwork for the institutionalization of awareness
  practices like Alexander Technique in US conservatories, and set the tone for
  the embodied musicology of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
  <p>In 1976, the critic Tom Wolfe famously derided the 1970s as the “me
  decade.” Today, even more measured scholars still tend to characterize these
  years as an era of individualistic retreat from the public sphere. I argue,
  however, that pedagogues of the musical awareness movement did not so much
  retreat from as reorient their approach to social engagement and political
  change. Though the awareness movement of the 1970s may have been about “me” in
  important ways, the work of Selver, Ortmans, and others shows that it was also
  about “us.”</p>
