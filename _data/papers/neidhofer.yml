abstract: |
    <p>In Italy, as elsewhere, World War II led to a fundamental questioning of
    the function of the arts and to a reorientation of artistic creation.
    Following calls by writers and philosophers such as Adorno, Mann, and Sartre
    for the arts to play an active role in the rebuilding of the post-war world,
    and by following recent examples of politically engaged music (e.g.,
    Schoenberg’s <i>Ode to Napoleon</i>, <i>A Survivor from Warsaw</i>,
    Dallapiccola’s <i>The Prisoner</i>), Italian composers produced a large body
    of politically committed music in the 1950s that can be grouped into three
    broad categories of (1) so-called “protest music” (Dallapiccola 1953), (2)
    works with biblical themes, and (3) music treating existentialist topics
    from contemporary philosophy and literature. Whereas recent scholarship on
    Italian politically engaged music has focused mainly on works of the first
    two kinds—on the works of “protest music” by Nono, Dallapiccola, and others
    (De Benedictis, Earle, Guerrero, Nielinger, Rizzardi, Samuel, et al) and
    religiously themed compositions by Dallapiccola, Petrassi, etc. (Alegant,
    Ciolfi)—music focusing on existentialist topics has received less analytical
    attention so far (Carroll).</p>

    <p>Taking as point of departure two vocal works by Camillo Togni on texts by
    Sartre (<i>Three Studies</i> [1950], <i>Ricerca</i> op. 36 [1954]), this
    paper demonstrates, with information from the sketches, how the composer
    continued to devise serial strategies as metaphors for the philosopher’s
    politically charged existentialist narratives in purely instrumental works
    as well. I examine this in an analysis of Togni’s <i>Fantasia
    concertante</i> (1957) for flute and string orchestra.</p>
