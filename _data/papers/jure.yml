title: "Musical Traits and Performance Practice of Uruguayan Candombe Drumming: A Computational Musicological Approach"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Candombe drumming is one of the most characteristic elements of Uruguayan
  popular culture. Deeply rooted in the Afro-Atlantic tradition, it has been
  widely adopted by the society at large, although it remains a symbol of the
  identity of the communities of African descent in Montevideo. Not very
  well-known abroad, Uruguayan Candombe possesses a considerable rhythmic wealth
  and deserves wider recognition. In acknowledgment of its rich history and
  cultural value, in 2009 it was inscribed on the Representative List of the
  Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this talk is to describe the most characteristic performance
  practices of Candombe drumming and analyze its most relevant musical traits,
  with special attention to the rhythmic patterns of the three drums used in
  Candombe, and their interplay. The talk will also present some lines of
  research developed in recent years that apply techniques of Music Information
  Retrieval and computational musicology to the analysis of different aspects of
  Candombe drumming.</p>
