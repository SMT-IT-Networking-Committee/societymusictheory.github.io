title: "An Afterlife of Tselostnyi Analiz (Holistic Analysis): Topic Theory in Soviet Musicology"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>This paper surveys topic theory as preached and practiced by Soviet
  musicologists between 1960 and 1990. With the exception of Boris Asafyev’s
  theory of intonation (Asafyev 1971 [1930/1947]), some elements of which align
  with Western topic theory (Tarasti 2012), Soviet topic theory remains
  virtually unknown outside of Russia. Asafyev, however, was not the only one
  interested in deep consideration of music’s signifying potential. An entire
  new analytical system, known as <i>tselostnyi analiz</i> (holistic analysis),
  was founded in the 1930s by two Moscow theorists, Leo Mazel and Viktor
  Zuckerman (Tsukkerman), to systematically explore the symbolism of the musical
  language itself, as well as music’s other expressive means. In the 1960s,
  holistic analysis underwent a reorientation (Zavlunov 2014), one manifestation
  of which was a blossoming of musical semiotics, and, specifically, of topic
  theory. Mazel’s analyses post-1960 frequently reference topics, which he calls
  “genres.” Zuckerman’s studies (1964, 1971, 1975 and beyond) discuss
  “intonations,” “genres,” and “<i>obrazy</i>”<i> </i>(images or figures) as
  means of communication—all three denoting topics. The work of Mazel and,
  particularly, Zuckerman stimulated the next generation of theorists to take
  their ideas in new directions. T. Bershadskaia (2004 [1970s]), for instance,
  explores how composers’ own association of tonal structures with the
  extra-musical contribute to their formal conceptions. V. Bobrovskii writes
  about topics and their functional effect in musical form (1970; 1978); he also
  examines how topical “thematicism” impacts musical perception (1989). Ye.
  Nazaikinskii (1982; 2003) uses topics—their placement, succession, and
  interaction—to explore the internal logic of musical compositions. </p>
