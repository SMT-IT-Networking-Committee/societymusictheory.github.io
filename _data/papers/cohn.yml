abstract: |
    <p>Music theory textbooks share a consensus definition of meter, which is
    directly appropriated from the late 18th century. I identify several
    problems with the definition, from the standpoint of modern metric
    research. I propose that the problems result from a three-stage process of
    transmission, whose origin is the ancient Greek theory of poetic verse
    feet, and whose intermediate stages are 18th-century theory of poetic
    prosody, and 18th-century theory of (mostly) vocal music. At each stage,
    the source has considerable prestige within the culture of the target
    domain. This encourages an uncritical adoption ("shoehorning") of features
    that fit poorly with the repertories being modelled. I propose a
    repertory-general definition of musical meter, based on modern research,
    that avoids all of the identified problems, but requires some minor
    terminological retooling.</p>
