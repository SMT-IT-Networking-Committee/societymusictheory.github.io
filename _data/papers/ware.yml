title: "Reinterpretation as Cultural Practice: Sketches for a Cover Song
Continuum"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>The website SecondHandSongs counts nearly 300,000 covers from any
    linguistic or cultural origin. By their own admission, this is likely a
    vast underestimation. If this points to anything, it is that cover songs
    are an unquestionably important medium of cultural expression in popular
    music around the globe. Yet, outside of analyses focused on individual
    original-cover pairings, scholarship has paid little attention to the
    overall cultural practice of covering.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I suggest a possible way forward by advancing a theory
    that sees originals as “strategies,” or institutional forces, which
    artists use, adapt, and resist through the individual creative
    decisions—or tactics—made in the creation new versions. These decisions
    can be thought to lie on a continuum where similarity (isomorphism) and
    difference (metamorphism) are plotted against each other. Thus, they are
    construed as co-productive aspects of interpretation; a tactic that will
    always result in both likeness and contrast, albeit in differing
    proportions. By understanding these proportions in each tactic across the
    whole cover, specific observations about how the artist’s interpretation
    of the song can be advanced. The Eagles of Death Metal’s version of “Save
    A Prayer” (2015), originally by Duran Duran (1982), serves as a case
    study. By examining pronunciation, production, lyrics, performance, genre,
    register, harmony, counterpoint, and timbre, I argue that the cover band’s
    interpretation is deliberately resistant to the original in order to
    create new meanings more in line with their identity.</p>
