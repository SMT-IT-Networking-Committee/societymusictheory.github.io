abstract: |
  <p>Anti-immigrant sentiment has taken many forms in US history. Among the
  well-documented incidents of World War I, the case of conductor Karl Muck
  and the Boston Symphony Orchestra is notorious for its combination of
  nationalist patriotism and xenophobic opposition to international influence
  on American concert organizations. Although it seemed on the surface to be a
  spontaneous uprising against a foreign musician who refused to play “The
  Star-Spangled Banner,” the public outcry against Muck was part of a larger
  campaign orchestrated by a shadowy propaganda magazine named <i>The
  Chronicle</i>. This journal was marketed to America’s wealthy elite and was
  available to subscribers by invitation only. In its pages, the editor
  Richard Fletcher (who claimed to be British but was actually an Ohio native
  of German ancestry) urged his upper-crust readers to root out German culture
  wherever they found it lurking in American society. Employing no
  professional journalists, he invited readers to submit articles regardless
  of their qualifications. By strategic publication of fake news stories and
  xenophobic editorials, he spread fear and suspicion through the most
  rarefied strata of American society. The journal was instrumental in
  blacklisting suspicious businesses and fomenting prejudice against enemy
  aliens. Contributor Lucie Jay, a member of the New York Philharmonic board
  and herself an American of German ancestry, was Fletcher’s most active
  surrogate. During the course of 1917 and 1918, she wrote increasingly
  vitriolic articles for <i>The Chronicle</i> that contributed to the banning
  of German-language operas at the Met, the internment of Muck, and the
  near-elimination of German repertoire from American orchestral programs.
  This paper will trace the influence of this little-known journal on American
  musical attitudes of the era, reflecting on the power of propaganda to sway
  citizens of a democratic nation that values free speech.</p>
