abstract: |
  <p>Richard Wagner’s opera <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> is one of those rare
  musical works that has attracted scholars of virtually every theoretical
  persuasion, and as such has spawned an almost bewildering number of analyses.
  Schenkerian approaches are no exception to this. The celebrated Prelude to Act
  I, for instance, has witnessed a divergence of voice-leading interpretation of
  unprecedented scope in Schenker studies. The many responses to and
  commentaries on these analyses have added a further dimension to the Prelude’s
  Schenkerian reception—there are even analyses of the Prelude that are not
  Schenkerian <i>per se </i>but contain visible traces of Schenkerian
  thinking.</p>
  <p>Drawing on a selection of Schenkerian(-inflected) interpretations of the
  Tristan Prelude from the 1940s to the present day, this paper will explore the
  conceptual fault lines separating competing Schenkerian analyses of Wagner’s
  opera, and identify what each interpretation tells us not only about the music
  but also about the history of Schenkerian thought over the past century. The
  paper will first detail how divergent thoughts and assumptions about the role
  of tonality in <i>Tristan</i> have played into Schenkerian approaches to the
  opera; it will then zoom in on the Prelude by comparing both the graphic and
  verbal strategies of <i>Tristan</i>’s Schenkerian interlocutors, with the aim
  of triggering a wider analytical intertext around the work. To conclude, the
  paper will propose strategies for evaluating Schenkerian methodologies to
  <i>Tristan</i> in particular and to the history of Schenkerian analysis more
  generally.</p>
