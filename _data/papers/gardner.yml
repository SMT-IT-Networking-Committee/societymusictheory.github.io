abstract: |
    <p>Trumpet player Miles Davis’s 1970 album <em>Bitches Brew</em> is taken by many to be the first entry in the genre sometimes called fusion or jazz-rock. However, upon further consideration of the music of Davis and other closely associated musicians in the years preceding and following 1970, it becomes clear that the “fusion” label is too tidy a description of the actual ways in which popular styles are invoked and incorporated in this music. A better way to understand the function of popular-music elements is in terms of topic theory.</p>
    <p>One theoretical issue that arises in attempting to apply topic theory to this music is that of what I call the “host genre”: the generic background onto which topics are added as external references. A working theory of generic and topical signification is constructed in which the host genre is a potentially unstable theoretical object, rather than an <em>a priori</em> designation. A few styles of popular music which serve as important topics and potential host genres are discussed: (1) Latin jazz, (2) soul jazz, (3) hard rock, (4) jam rock, (5) psychedelia, (6) slow “groove funk,” and (7) fast funk in the style of James Brown.</p>
    <p>Finally, analyses of three Davis-led recordings from this period are presented, with an emphasis on the way in which specific musical moments throw into question the stable identity of the host genre. What emerges is a new understanding of how a sense of genre as in contradiction or even absent contributes to musical meaning.</p>
