    <p>While music theorists widely acknowledge the chorale’s privileged
    position in American music theory, very little scholarship critically
    examines this position. In this paper, I address this omission by
    presenting a corpus study of leading undergraduate textbooks. I aim
    through this study not only to establish the prevalence of chorales in
    undergraduate music theory instruction, but, more importantly, to reveal
    some particularities of their usage and the commitments this usage
    encodes.</p>
    <p>I begin by investigating chorales’ prevalence. I examine their
    incidence among musical examples, authors’ purposes in using them, and
    their distribution relative to particular topics. I also explore authors’
    handling of chorales. I demonstrate their preference for four-part, vocal,
    homophonic chorale-harmonizations by J. S. Bach; but I also discuss their
    presentation, both visually and aurally, as a texture rather than as a
    genre, and one abstracted from cultural context and instrumentation.
    Through an examination of authors’ explicit definitions of the terms
    “chorale” and “chorale style,” I show the chorale’s close connection to a
    widely held model of musical structure. Indeed, to all appearances, the
    chorale in American music theorists’ preferred form is virtually
    indistinguishable from this model of musical structure. Finally, I discuss
    authors’ justifications for employing chorales and “chorale style”: their
    various appeals—to biology, musical norms, and musical ontologies, among
    others—and attempts to normativize chorale-related practices.</p>
    <p>Through this corpus study, I then show that the chorale lies deeply
    entrenched in American music theory and is closely connected to the
    field’s basic practices and theoretical commitments.</p>
