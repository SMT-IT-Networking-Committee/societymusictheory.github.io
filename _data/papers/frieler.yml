abstract: |
    <p>Much has been written about John Coltrane and Miles Davis, from
    autobiographical works over detailed musicological analyses up to cultural
    and sociological accounts of their life, work, and legacy. Fewer works are
    concerned with a direct comparison of both artists’ improvisatorial
    approach. Comparisons often boil down to the contrast of Coltrane being an
    “angry” player with a calm personality and Miles a “cool” player with an
    assertive personality. We like to add a new analytical perspective by
    using computational and statistical methods as developed in the context of
    Jazzomat Research Project. Based on a large set of solo transcriptions
    taken from the Weimar Jazz Database, spanning different stylistic phases
    for both artists (currently 13 solos by Coltrane from 1956-1963 and 8
    solos by Miles Davis from 1954-1966), we identify concurrent and
    overlapping stylistic traits. This approach utilizes a large set of
    musical features extracted from the solos. Results indicate that both
    players differ in many aspects. The cliché of the “extroverted” style of
    Coltrane and the “introverted” style of Davis does indeed hold up as
    indicated by vastly different note densities and overall spacing of tones
    and phrases. Some surprising and subtle differences also showed up. For
    instance, Davis has a tendency to avoid the third of the underlying chord
    and also major and minor thirds as well as larger intervals. Furthermore,
    Coltrane based his improvisations to a larger extent on patterns than
    Davis and both players have no significant overlap in their respective
    pattern vocabularies.</p>
