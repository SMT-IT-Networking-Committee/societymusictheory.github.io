    <p>Good Mariachi practice is based on a holistic model of performance that includes a prescribed repertoire of bass lines, harmonic changes, meters, forms and instrumental voicings that operate in synchrony. Despite having coalesced around distinct regional styles both within and without Mexico, the musical tradition of Mariachi rests on select formal principles drawn from the Mexican <em>Ranchera,</em> Mexican <em>Son</em> and the historic instrumentation of trumpet, violin, <em>vihuela</em>/guitar, and <em>guitarrón</em>, transmitted primarily through aural instruction. These models are derived from the “<em>Cajón</em> versions” that form the core repertoire of a Mariachi ensemble, a standard repertoire established by the late 1970s and early 1980s. Classic <em>Ranchera Valseadas</em> such as “Hermoso Cariño,” “Las Botas de Charro,” “Con la Misma Tijera,” and “Los Laureles” were codified in well-known performances by arrangers and artists such as Ruben Fuentes, Vicente Fernández, Linda Ronstadt, and Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan. Inspired by Gjerdingen’s <em>Music in the Galant Style</em>, we present schema prototypes modeled on foundational examples in the core Mariachi repertoire. These archetypes incorporate specific harmonic motions, bass patterns and instrumental voicings within a single, well-defined unit. We will also address the practice of marrying vocal lines to these models according to lyric content and expression, and describe how those units shape larger musical narratives. We further address these paradigms as they shape repertoire expansion and the expression of regional style within contemporary Mariachi practice in ensembles such as Mariachi Nuevo Amanecer (Los Angeles). </p>
