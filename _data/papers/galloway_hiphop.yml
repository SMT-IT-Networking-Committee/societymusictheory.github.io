handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Hip-hop is uniquely positioned for nuanced readings of place, spatial
  transition, embodied knowledge of lived environments, and explicit references
  to socio-spatial information. Neglected urban neighborhoods not only suffer
  the worst environmental conditions, but they are also spaces where the
  intersectional nature of environmental abuse is laid most bareâ€”an outcome of
  intertwined economic, geographic, and sociocultural factors. I address how
  hip-hop introduces marginalized perspectives and voices to address the
  problematic authority of whiteness that conspicuously dominates the discourse
  on music, sound, and environment, a relatively homogenous and exclusionary
  artistic, technological, and scientific discussion. Hip-hop-based
  environmentalism serves as an important corrective.</p>
