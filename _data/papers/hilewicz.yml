abstract: |
  <p>Schoenberg’s only published music for film—<i>Begleitungsmusik zu einer
  Lichtspielscene </i>(Accompaniment to a Film Scene), op. 34 (1929–30)—provides
  a glimpse into his fascination with the medium. Schoenberg regarded the
  <i>Begleitungsmusik </i>as a concert piece that could also accompany a film
  depicting its program; however, published analyses have claimed that the piece
  fits comfortably neither film nor programmatic music paradigms (Hush 1984,
  Neumeyer 1993, Haimo 2002). Although the analyses reveal aspects of the work’s
  structure, none considers the <i>Begleitungsmusik </i>as musical blueprint for
  a film scene, which could also become the soundtrack of such scene. Offering
  an interpretive approach to the piece as programmatic music for film, I argue
  that reconsidering the piece in this way leads to a deeper understanding of
  its structure.</p>
  <p>To test this hypothesis, I collaborated with the artist Stephen Sewell, who
  used film-editing tools to create a scene based on my analysis of the
  <i>Begleitungsmusik</i>. We put together fragments of scenes from
  contemporaneous films, creating a new work that expresses the
  <i>Begleitungsmusik</i>’s program and structure. Whereas previous analysts
  have identified “extraordinary incongruence” in the <i>Begleitungsmusik</i>,
  my analysis identifies continuities that suggest the work could function as a
  programmatic plan for a film. While expressing musical analysis through film
  proves remarkably appropriate to this composition, in fact, analytical
  visualization can contribute to an array of interpretive approaches, allowing
  listeners to connect an analytical reading in real time to their experience.
