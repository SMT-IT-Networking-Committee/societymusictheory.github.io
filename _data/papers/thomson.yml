title: "Unmasking the \"Foreign Body\": Large-scale Formal Process and Microtonal Language in Georg F. Haas’s String Quartet No. 1"
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Georg Friedrich Haas (1999) defines four categories of microtonality:
    equally-tempered divisions of the octave or other intervals, intervals
    derived from the overtone series, near-unison intervals,
    (<i>Klangspaltung</i>, tone- or sound- splitting), and aleatoric
    techniques. Haas then discusses the compositional design of his Quartet
    No. 1, describing a “foreign body” that gradually infiltrates the
    descending shapes of the beginning. It eventually surfaces with greatest
    clarity two-thirds of the way through the composition, thus “removing its
    mask.” Once revealed, the foreign body begins to decay, obscuring its
    identity in future appearances.</p>
    <p>I trace the path of the foreign body—the acoustically tuned dominant
    seventh chord—as it intertwines with other microtonal types. Close
    inspection of each appearance of the foreign body unveils a large-scale
    formal process through a background progression of these chords spanning
    the entire composition. While initial appearances of the chord seem
    arbitrary, they are in fact guided proportionally according to the golden
    ratio, and are used to structure the first half.</p>
    <p>Haas’s use of microtonal types in this work create contrast that can
    aid a listener in perceiving structures and making large-scale
    connections. However, the question of understanding certain microtonal
    sonorities remains open. I contemplate different options for interpreting
    such sonorities and suggest that Hass’s microtonal types can lead to
    reconsideration of microtonal harmony. This paper extends the work of
    Hasegawa (2015), who analyzes the juxtaposition of intonation modes in two
    further works by Haas, and complements analyses of microtonal language as
    in Elster (1991), Gann (1993), Gilmore (1995), and Werntz (2001).</p>
