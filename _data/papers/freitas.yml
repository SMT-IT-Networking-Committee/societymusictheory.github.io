abstract: |
  <p>In the penultimate scene of Giulio Rospigliosi and Luigi Rossi’s <i>Palazzo
  incantato</i>, based on incidents from <i>Orlando furioso</i>, the characters
  unexpectedly call a halt to the plot and proceed to play a series of parlor
  games. More specifically, Orlando challenges the others to “retrieve their
  forfeits,” marking the scene as the conclusion of a contemporary game, when
  those who have played poorly can redeem themselves with a show of wit or
  talent. One character solves a riddle, another responds to a traditional
  <i>questione d’amore</i>, a couple improvises <i>stornelli</i>, and several
  (naturally) sing songs. </p>
  <p>I argue that this remarkable scene frames the opera—the first patronized by
  the influential Cardinal Antonio Barberini—in an unexpected and heretofore
  unremarked way. If the published <i>argomento</i> (and much subsequent
  scholarship) describes the work as an allegory—Reason frees the Human Soul
  from the delusions of Love—this scene contends rather that it has all been a
  spirited amusement. Indeed, a close reading of the libretto, in light of
  contemporary game treatises (Girolamo and Scipione Bargagli), recent
  scholarship on Renaissance pastimes (Riccò, Schleuse), and the foundational
  work of Murata and Hammond, suggests that notwithstanding its length and
  theatrical setting, this opera can fruitfully be regarded as a product of the
  chamber environment. Rather than one of Rospigliosi’s typical morality plays,
  <i>Palazzo incantato</i> reveals itself as a work that, like so many elite
  pastimes, revels in the pains and pleasures of love. This perspective may help
  explain some of the unusual features of the opera, including what critics have
  called its discontinuous plot and surfeit of laments. Indeed, the whole
  enterprise would seem to owe more to the episodic and rhetorical cantata than
  to either the earlier “saints operas” or the developing Venetian <i>dramma per
  musica</i>. Aiming to recreate the intimacy and playful eroticism of the
  salon, Antonio and his assembled artists produced an extraordinary work, one
  that suggests an unusual and intriguing approach to the young genre.</p>
