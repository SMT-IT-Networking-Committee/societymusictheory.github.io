    <p>A striking feature of the music of Edgard Varèse is the emphasis assigned to timbre and rhythm, resulting in complex sound masses. Varèse’s compositional processes have been associated with a spatial framework and visual imagery as a metaphorical description of his music. Nevertheless, Jonathan W. Bernard (1981) introduces a series of Varèse's compositional techniques which reveals these as not simple metaphorical thoughts, but actual Varèse’s practical procedures to organize pitches in the register. These organizations may be implemented in various ways by placing pitches in time, with a specific timbre and articulation. Each of those realizations underlies the design of a textural configuration. A textural configuration may be understood as the organization of <em>n</em> simultaneous sounding components into <em>m</em> textural layers, which may be described by an integer partition in such a way that each integer stands for a textural layer and its value depicts the number of sounding components therein (Gentil-Nunes 2009). In this paper, I discuss some recurrent textural gestures in the music of Varèse, considering their relation with pitch, time, and timbre in a spatial perspective. One of Varèse’s most recurrent textural gestures concerns the various articulations of sounding masses (blocks) by the successive superposition of sustaining notes. Thus, a block with <em>n</em> notes may use any partition of <em>n</em>, by considering the cumulative superimposition of their constituent parts. Finally, the analytical tools I introduce in this paper enable accessing all spatial arrangements of these layers to discuss both gradual constructions and dilutions of blocks.</p>
