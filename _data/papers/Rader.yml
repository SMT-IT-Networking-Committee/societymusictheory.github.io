    <p>Previous scholarship in dance and music often treats choreography as a response to musical cues. This model does not account for the reciprocal relationship between synchronous gesture and sound; the musical score, an unchanging object, serves as the source of information for gesture (Leman and Naveda 2010). I challenge this model by arguing that dance and music reciprocally reinforce or contradict one another. This dialectical approach incorporates choreographic analysis into musical analysis, destabilizing what appears fixed in the score. </p>
    <p>The centerpiece for the study is Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker’s choreography to Béla Bartók’s String Quartet No. 4, titled Bartók/Aantekeningen and released as the award-winning film <em>Hoppla!</em> My analysis translates choreographic ideas into systematic patterns, emphasizing visual and kinesthetic experiences of dance, and expanding on Kozak’s exploration of “musical forms that challenge notions of a linear and uniformly moving time” (Kozak, 2020). I contribute to the rich body of literature on Bartók by reevaluating existing musical analyses informed by interactions with Keersmaeker’s choreography.</p>
    <p>My methodology undertakes two analyses, one musical and one gestural, then fuses them to discover their connections and discords. Investigations of metrical layers, pitch collections, and form will bring new perspectives into music- and dance-analytical relationships. Mapping choreography alongside score analysis offers added layers of complexity to formalized music-theoretical elements, giving the music new meanings beyond the fixed score. </p>
