    <p>This paper formalizes the harmonic norms of a popular music corpus (the
    McGill Billboard Corpus; Burgoyne 2012) by reconceptualizing harmonic
    objects as progressions, eschewing single chords or functions as the most
    salient cognitive entities learned through enculturation. While recent
    music-theoretical work uses computational methods to analyze harmonic
    probabilities in musical corpora and model their stylistic norms (i.e. de
    Clercq and Temperley 2011; Temperley and Clercq 2013; White 2014; White
    and Quinn, in press), it often focuses on analyzing single chord counts,
    chord-to-chord transitional probabilities, or common-practice harmonic
    functions. Given the varied role of harmony (Tagg 2014) and a
    preponderance of common <i>stock</i> progressions, like the “Doo-Wop”
    (I-vi-IV-V) or “Four-Chord” (I-V-vi-IV), in popular music, the progression
    is taken as a starting point for analysis.</p>

    <p>Songs are segmented into entropy-bounded chord sequences, resulting in
    recursive loops (including nested repetitions of <i>stock</i>
    progressions). Due to key ambiguity arising from repetition or mode
    mixture in popular styles, the sequences are further abstracted from their
    tonal center and categorized only by chord quality and root-to-root
    intervallic distance. The analysis is, therefore, devoid of key or chord
    function labels. The sequences, then reduced to the smallest repeated
    segment or <i>chain,</i> are classified into prototypes, including
    possible variant progressions and <i>functions</i>, the latter couched
    within specific formal and metrical contexts. Representative musical
    examples are provided. The results’ ties to and implications for schema
    theory, cognitive theories of learning and expectation, and a general
    definition of <i>tonality</i> (including harmonic interaction with
    thematic and formal processes) are discussed.</p>
