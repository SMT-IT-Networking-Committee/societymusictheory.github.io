  <p>The intertwined histories of opera in Buenos Aires and Montevideo during
  the nineteenth century follow a similar pattern to that found elsewhere in
  South America: a burst of activity in the 1820s into the 1830s, in the wake of
  independence, followed by a yawning gap of years or decades, before a second
  wave of performances takes off within sight of 1850. Purpose-built opera
  houses then appear (the Solís in 1856 and the Colón in 1857), before improved
  communication and transportation, greater prosperity, and increased European
  emigration—notably from Italy—all bring the continent firmly within the global
  operatic circuit by the end of the century. But if such outlines seem clear
  enough, key historiographical questions remain, particularly in relation to
  the first half of the century. First, how much prominence to give to the
  touring troupes of the period: ragtag and frequently erratic, yet feted by
  local elites as musical exemplars for a republican age? Second, how to
  theorize the popularity of an Italian bel canto style whose success—through
  military, domestic and ecclesiastical use—transcended the civilizational
  rhetoric of some of its more influential advocates? And finally, how to
  rethink the apparent cycles of operatic glut and famine that characterize the
  region’s early operatic history? In this paper, I draw on contemporary
  journalism and other sources to argue that opera’s continued presence on both
  sides of the Río de la Plata during the “gap years” of the 1830s and 40s can
  best be measured not through the very occasional complete (or near-complete)
  performances, but through the synecdochic ability of individual arias to stand
  in for complete imagined works, whose merits could be argued out in the pages
  of contemporary newspapers as if available on stage. Meanwhile, I will reflect
  on the return of full-scale opera in both cities in the early 1850s, with
  twenty-nine local premieres in Montevideo in 1852 alone, and over thirty in
  Buenos Aires two years later. The implications of such immersion, I argue,
  deserves a central place in any reconceived operatic history of the period,
  whether local, national, continental or global.</p>
