abstract: |
  <p>Folksong has long been recognized as a fundamental component of socialist
  realist aesthetics. Indeed, Zdeněk Nejedlý’s prescriptions for “Czech realism”
  (“český realismus”), which he oversaw from his role as First Minister of
  Culture and Education under the Communist administration, were founded upon
  his interpretations of folksong in Bedřich Smetana’s works. The enduring
  success of the annually televised Strážnice Folkore Festival also points to
  folksong’s firm standing within the politics of the day.</p>
  <p>And yet folksong researchers under the Communist
  administration—musicologists employed by the state-funded Czechoslovak Academy
  of Sciences—were regularly threatened for their scholarship, demoted from
  their positions, and in some cases erased from the Academy’s publication
  history through book burnings. In the words of the organization’s
  Marxist-Leninist ideologue, Otakar Nahodil, the German-Romantic assumptions
  embedded in folksong research meant its practitioners would never be able to
  escape their own “bourgeois nationalism”; even shifting the focus of their
  studies from the rural <i>Volk</i> to the urban laborer would not prevent
  music research from “logically” leading to “racism.” </p>
  <p>This paper examines the ideological theorizations of Nahodil and his
  opponents—especially Jiří Horák, president of the pre-existing State Institute
  for Folksong (Státní ústav pro lidovou píseň)—to reveal the hidden stakes of
  post-war musicology in Communist Czechoslovakia. According to Horák, the
  positivist fieldwork he and his colleagues conducted always served the
  “truth,” regardless of political setting. Nahodil, by contrast, viewed Horák’s
  claims as deeply tainted by German nationalism and eventually ousted folksong
  research from the Academy altogether. Building from Peter Skalník’s criticism
  of anthropological research in the Academy of Sciences and Ondřej Slačálek’s
  discussions of conflicting nationalisms under Czechoslovak Communism, this
  paper reveals Nahodil’s attempts to de-Germanize Czech folksong as
  substituting an implicit (German) nationalist agenda in folksong research with
  an explicit (Soviet-inspired) one. Within such a setting, scholars’
  methodological debates, more than political posturing, operated as platforms
  for proving their ideological purity—their worthiness—to the state. Though
  their arguments concerned musicological “truths,” in reality they responded to
  threats against scholars’ livelihoods and, in some cases, lives.</p>
