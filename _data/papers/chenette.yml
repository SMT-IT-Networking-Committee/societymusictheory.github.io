title: "What Are the Truly Aural Skills?"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>The current approach to organizing an aural skills class, judging from
  chapter titles of textbooks, is the result of this multiplication problem:
  (sight reading and dictation) × (content and order of a music theory
  curriculum).</p>
  <p>This model needs to be critiqued on three counts. First, as Klonoski
  argued, we do not know if “the sequence of topics typically found in tonal
  theory texts . . . also represents the optimal perceptual ordering.” Second,
  it is not clear why advanced theoretical topics deserve chapters in an aural
  skills text while equally aural topics from other fields do not. Finally, the
  explicit focus on “written” theory skills leaves the development of truly
  perceptual skills mostly implicit. To address these critiques, we need to
  either reframe or rethink our teaching by answering: which skills are truly,
  and most fundamentally, aural?</p>
  <p>I propose that what makes a skill fundamentally aural is the degree to
  which it directly engages working memory and the correlated ability to control
  attention. All listening and performing activities rely on these skills. Most
  music-theoretical topics, however, rely on some degree of theoretical
  mediation between aural stimulus and cognitive processing. The most radical
  interpretation of this proposal would suggest a completely new model of aural
  skills instruction. Yet this presentation will also suggest less radical
  responses such as de-emphasizing tasks based on logical distinctions that are
  less obvious in perception, creating chapters in textbooks explicitly focused
  on cognitive skills, and opening up aural skills classes to skills derived
  from fields outside music theory.</p>
