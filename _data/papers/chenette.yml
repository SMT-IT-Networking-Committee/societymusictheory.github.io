      bio: |
        <p>Timothy Chenette teaches aural skills and music theory at Utah State University. His aural skills pedagogy research explores cognitive foundations, innovative methods, and particularly how to teach the elusive skill of identifying chords within a progression. In addition to simply improving instruction, this research is inspired in part by a desire to make music teaching more inclusive, accessible, and creative. His pedagogy and early music research have been published in <em>Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy</em>, <em>Music Theory Online</em>, <em>Early Music</em>, <em>College Music Symposium</em>, and <em>Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy</em>.</p>

    <p>In one-line dictation, students must encode a fleeting auditory signal and interpret it in relation to a tonal and metrical context in light of norms of notation; in polyphonic and harmonic dictation, they must additionally parse multiple voices and consider norms of counterpoint, voice leading, and harmony. Addressing such complex tasks, Karpinski’s (2000) greatest contribution to listening skills pedagogy is his emphasis on musicality. Over and over, Karpinski emphasizes the need to present music in realistic conditions, particularly avoiding key and meter cues and “atomistic” strategies such as isolated interval identification; in harmonic dictation, Karpinski urges instructors to avoid relatively unmusical four-part dictation followed by “harmonic looking,” in favor of listening for the bass, intervals above the bass, and voice leading, in service of developing the ideal endpoint of “Gestalt” (holistic) listening.</p>
    <p>I will survey how these perspectives have been synthesized in contemporary instruction, as well as how they have been taken in new directions by Urista (2016), Stevens (2017), de Clercq (2014), Sayrs (2019), and Chenette, et al. (2019), among others. In short, the foundation laid by Karpinski is still in place, and most research since ASA’s publication has either developed his ideas in more detail or explored their cognitive foundations. I suggest some of the most promising areas for future study include further investigation into the role of stock patterns and music theoretical knowledge in chord identification, as well as further exploration into the ways instrument-based imagery and physical motion aid in all kinds of dictation.</p>
