abstract: |
  <p>The pervasive influence of popular dance-songs in early modern Hispanic
  literature and colonial cultures has long been recognized by literary and
  musical scholars. Hundreds of plays, stories, and text booklets for sacred
  <i>villancicos</i> call for them. In approaching the dance-songs, musicologists
  have focused primarily on analyzing form and genre, finding and listing musical
  sources, categorizing poetic texts, and generally describing their broad
  cultural context. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I focus on <i>jácaras</i> and <i>seguidillas</i>, dance-songs
  that were repeatedly condemned by moralists and even prohibited, though they
  were performed all over the Hispanic dominions in secular and sacred genres.
  Their tunes, rhythms, and harmonic patterns (made especially clear to us in
  solo instrumental settings) were distinct and recognizable to all kinds of
  listeners, so they communicated meaning through their very musical materials
  (not merely in their song texts). My recent research has uncovered what might
  be the key to understanding the specific and paradoxical value of these
  dance-songs to seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century ecclesiastical
  authorities.</p>
  <p>Many <i>jácaras</i> and <i>seguidillas</i> describe, execute, facilitate or
  narrate the violation of feminine spaces, womanly precincts, female privacy,
  and even the female body. My presentation moves from a sacred play by Miguel de
  Cervantes, to the first extant Spanish opera (<i>Celos aun del aire matan</i>,
  Madrid 1660) and the first New World opera (<i>La púrpura de la rosa</i>, Lima
  1701), and then to provocative excerpts from sacred <i>villancicos</i> composed
  in Spain, colonial New Spain (Mexico), and colonial Latin America. In many
  vernacular sacred pieces, for example, profane songs about the impossibility of
  guarding female virtue are turned around with phallic imagery to describe how
  the virgin Mary’s own immaculate conception rendered her inviolate, or to
  reiterate for earthbound women the lesson of Eve’s crucial mistake in the
  garden of Eden. In some <i>villancicos</i>, the violence of the <i>jácara</i>
  conveys the virgin Mary’s valor, so that she exemplifies womanly struggle
  amidst the shouts and jibes of pimps and ruffians (<i>jaques</i>). Finally, I
  will explain how these interpretive insights may usefully enliven modern
  performances. My paper will be illustrated with both audio examples and visual
  evidence presented via Powerpoint slides.</p>
