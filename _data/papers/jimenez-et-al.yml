abstract: |
    <p>A chord can be thought of as an idealized set of pitch relationships that do not depend on timbre, register, duration, etc. A chord can also be thought of as an actual, sounding event in the world, where it inevitably possesses characteristics that pertain to “extra-harmonic” parameters such as timbre, register, and duration. Although thinking of chords in that abstract way facilitates our structuring, memorizing, and understanding music, chords as actual sounding events are also likely to play an important role in our experiencing of music. The present study investigates chords as actual sounding events by testing the ability to identify popular songs from single chords taken from well-known recordings. Although it is currently believed that timbre plays a primary role in the identification of songs from very brief excerpts of music, it is possible that vertical pitch structures may also play a role in that type of rapid identification. As expected, our results showed that chords timbral brightness and, to a lesser extent, their attack time, chord-type commonness, duration, and the song’s year of release contributed to the song’s rapid recognition. This study shows that memory for chords as actual sounding events can be detailed enough to allow listeners with and without musical training to identify songs from a single piano chord. Results also suggest that both harmonic and extra-harmonic characteristics of single chords are encoded in auditory long-term memory and contribute to the rapid identification of songs from single chords.</p>
