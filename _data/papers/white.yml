      bio: |
        <p>Andrew Malilay White is from Guam, where his family still resides. He first began studying music theory and piano performance at the University of Guam. He received degrees from the University of Notre Dame, New York University, and the University of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Andrew researches how nineteenth-century pianists practiced in order to improvise. These improvisatory practice methods were linked to thoroughbass and related eighteenth-century practices like the partimento tradition, but in many cases were chordal and "harmonic" in conception. This research is based on the pedagogical materials of Carl Czerny, Simon Sechter, and Friedrich Wieck, as well as sketches and works by Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt and accounts of their playing and improvisation. His secondary interests include topic theory, live coding music, and the anthropology of skill. His hobbies include playing tabletop RPGs, homebrewing beer, and growing agave plants.</p>
        <p>In 2018 Andrew's research was supported by a Eugene K. Wolf Grant for European Research from the American Musicological Society. In 2019, he received the Indiana University Press award from AMS Midwest for his paper entitled "Teaching by Example: 'Practical' Pedagogies of the Postclassical Thoroughbass." He was a 2019–2020 Stuart Tave Teaching Fellow of the University of Chicago's Humanities Division, where he taught a seminar-workshop for undergraduates titled "Improvisation: Critical Studies in Music." Andrew is now a 2020–2021 Graduate Fellow of the interdisciplinary Franke Institute for the Humanities.</p>

    <p>How did pianists of the nineteenth century practice for improvisation, and how can their ways of practicing affect our view of musical texts and works? This paper develops an entextualization framework to describe how Clara Schumann assembled her musical materials in the mid-nineteenth century. Entextualization, a concept from the work of Michael Silverstein and Gregory Urban in linguistic anthropology, is used to describe how portions of discourse are adapted and treated as objects in new contexts—how utterances “become text” within a broad view of what Kristeva and Barthes called “cultural text.” This paper establishes a theoretical framework centered not around works or their composition, but rather built upon the specific “passage”-based practice method used by Friedrich Wieck and Carl Czerny. The framework is then used it to model Clara Schumann’s improvisatory and compositional process, showing how she alters not only her musical materials (as practiced “passages”) but also her fashioning of her own image as a performer. Schumann’s <em>Caprices en forme de valse</em>, op. 2 (1832) is analyzed, as well as a sketch of one of her improvised preludes notated late in her career.</p>
    <p>Midcentury piano repertoires, I ultimately argue, are well served by a decentered theory of musical creation based on entextualization and bodily skill. Such a theory would illuminate aspects of music-making that are missed by theories that prioritize musical works and hermeneutic interpretations. This makes vivid Barthes’s claim that “text is experienced only in an activity of production” (1988).</p>
