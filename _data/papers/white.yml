    <p>This paper extends recent work on musical topic by showing the cultural
    mechanisms behind the emergence of the “yodeling style” in the early
    nineteenth century. Danuta Mirka has argued that musical topics are
    “styles and genres taken out of their proper context and used in another”
    (2014). Topic theory, then, can describe a process where specialized
    regional musics are incorporated into the musics of European capitals in a
    periphery-to-center model.</p>

    <p>At the turn of the nineteenth century, the yodel became international:
    London’s <i>Harmonicon</i>, for example, declared in 1829 that “every
    vagabond in Paris can now give [a yodel] with as much facility as the
    Tyrolese mountaineers.” I contend that the condescending eye of urban
    cosmopolitanism played a major role in the rise of the yodel. Regional
    styles ultimately gave urban concertgoers a yardstick to measure their
    own sense of taste. My argument is informed by recent work on the
    musical topic by Mirka and Hatten (2014), as well as comparative and
    ethnographic studies of the yodel by Zemp (1987) and Sichardt (1939).
    Excerpts of pieces by Haibel, Rossini, Hummel, Marschner, Moscheles,
    and Mozart provide additional support.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the story of the “yodeling style” illustrates how topics
    can be constructed and how they implicate political actors. I argue that
    the ascent of the “yodeling style” is a sign of an emerging pan-urban
    cosmopolitanism, and further, that this form of cosmopolitanism is an
    essential part of the musical topic as used at the turn of the nineteenth
    century.</p>
