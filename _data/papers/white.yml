    <p>Is it possible to learn thoroughbass without memorizing any written
    rules? This paper examines two Viennese thoroughbass treatises that lack
    any written rules: Simon Sechter’s <i>Generalbass-Schule</i> (1835) and
    Carl Czerny’s <i>Studien zur praktischen Kenntniss aller Accorde des
    Generalbasses</i> (1854). Instead of listing rules and providing skeletal
    basslines, the treatises present only fully-realized chord
    progressions—and in Czerny’s case, even some exercises that could be
    described as idiomatic piano etudes. This represents an approach to
    thoroughbass pedagogy that I term the “practical thoroughbass,” which I
    claim played a driving role in determining the post-classical musical
    style. The students of Sechter and Czerny (who include Schubert and Liszt)
    may owe their flashiest and most idiosyncratic effects to the practical
    thoroughbass.</p>
    <p>Using the language of cognitive skill acquisition, this paper describes
    how the two treatises differ in method from the more familiar 18th-century
    partimento tradition. Unlike their 18th-century precursors, Sechter and
    Czerny do not need their readers to become adept at realizing a bass with
    figures. But despite this dissimilarity, the practical thoroughbass and
    the partimento tradition share the goal of turning thoroughbass rules into
    a broad structure for elaboration. I then show how Sechter and Czerny
    musically prioritize two aspects of skill acquisition:
    example-centeredness and generalization. The practical thoroughbass
    represents just one position in a century-long debate over whether
    thoroughbass was a performerly skill, a compositional theory, or some
    hybrid of both.</p>
