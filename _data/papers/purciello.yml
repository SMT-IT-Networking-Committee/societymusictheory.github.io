abstract: |
  <p>Scholars have long been fascinated with the varied manifestations of gender
  that appeared on the operatic stages of seventeenth-century Venice. Indeed,
  early operatic plots regularly featured scenes of gender disguise, ambiguity,
  transvestism, and transgressions of traditional gender roles. Rife with
  incongruity and inconsistency, such scenes have been understood best when
  viewed through a lens fashioned by the early modern “one-sex model.” This
  model’s emphasis on the fluidity between the sexes and association of
  masculinity and femininity with social rather than biological constructs has
  helped modern-day scholars to disentangle operatic gender representations and
  enabled the exploration of issues related to female empowerment and the
  representations of the masculine and feminine voice. In spite of these inroads
  in the study of gender in early opera, surprisingly little attention has been
  given to the operatic character type that most significantly embodies the
  complexities of the period’s gender constructs: the nurse “travestito.” </p>
  <p>Growing out of a tradition whose roots lie in antiquity, the early modern
  literary and theatrical nurse was most commonly a female selected from the
  lower class to care for and serve as confidant to a more youthful, often
  noble, female ward. In contrast to this characteristically feminine role, the
  nurse was also a pragmatist who at times promoted actions that others might
  consider immoral. As a further challenge to the feminine ideal, the nurse
  replaced the largely absent role of the mother with a female whose mobility
  between socio-economic and public/private spheres gave her both a degree of
  authority and a sense of agency. This paper explores how Venetian libretti
  embraced the overlapping feminine and masculine characteristics customarily
  ascribed to literary and theatrical nurse characters by casting their operatic
  equivalents as altos or, more comically, tenors in drag. An examination of
  scenes featuring the nurses of Monteverdi’s <i>L’incoronazione di Poppea</i>
  (1643) and Cavalli’s <i>Giasone</i> (1648) would suggest that early opera
  unashamedly utilized artifice as a means of exploring and, at times,
  highlighting the contravention of the real-life boundaries that lie between
  seventeenth-century constructions of gender.</p>
