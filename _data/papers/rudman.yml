    <p>Ellen Taaffe Zwilich’s music is characterized by organic yet unpredictable
    melodies and chord progressions. These intricate pitch structures are often
    created through the use of common-tone-preserving contextual inversions. This
    paper will present a theory for analyzing such pitch transformations and apply
    that framework to Zwilich’s Quintet (2011).</p>
    <p>Common-tone preserving contextual inversions can be applied to a wide
    variety of set classes. This allows a composer to use related processes on
    diverse pitch materials, creating a sense of coherence even when pitch
    collections differ. This can be seen in the Quintet, which features such
    inversions on a variety of melodic and harmonic motives.</p>
    <p>Though the first movement is distinct in terms of its pitch content, it is
    related to the others through common-tone-preserving contextual inversions and
    quotation. The other two movements are both based on a single hexachord type
    that does not appear in the first movement. Presented most often as a six-note
    blues scale, this set class has two interesting characteristics that Zwilich
    exploits in the work: an embedded series of inversionally-related (025)
    subsets with the potential for RI-chaining, and a high capacity for
    common-tone-preserving contextual inversions. These transformations are
    particularly important in the finale, which can be interpreted as passes in a
    compositional space relating all 24 forms of the hexachord through inversion
    and transposition. These passes delineate the movement’s ternary form and
    create a sense of directed motion in the music.</p>
