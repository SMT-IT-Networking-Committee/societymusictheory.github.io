  <p>This presentation proposes three correlations between Bernard Herrmann’s
  music and Saul Bass’s visuals in <i>Vertigo</i>’s prelude. These correlations
  emerge by placing Herrmann’s seven harmonies onto a ten-pitch-class planar
  version of the <i>Tonnetz</i>, using an orientation that matches the prelude’s
  lighting to sharpness of pitch. (1) Some chords are rotations of other chords,
  sharing the same fulcrum. These rotations, formalized as Stephen Brown’s
  transformations on a dual-interval space, well analogize Bass’s series of
  Lissajous curves of different colors, which rotate in either direction around
  the center of the frame. (2) The trajectory of the first part of the harmonic
  progression through the <i>Tonnetz</i> roughly matches the camera’s
  multi-stage motions across the woman’s face. Moreover, the first and third
  chords and camera stations span maximal distance across the <i>Tonnetz</i> and
  the face, respectively. (3) The second part of the harmonic progression
  through the <i>Tonnetz</i> asserts an enharmonic equivalence, which wraps the
  planar graph into a partial cylinder. This short circuit resonates with the
  experience of the film’s titular condition. But the absence of an orthogonal
  loop that would complete a torus creates a hybrid of infinite cyclicity and
  finite linearity. Analogously, through shading and zoom, Bass’s titles
  concentrate on central circularities while allowing the peripheral loops of
  the original Lissajous curves to fade into non-continuous tendrils.
  Interpreted in this way, both musical and visual figures suggest an uneasy
  amalgam of the imprisoning interior cycle and the longing for a sense of
  orientation, an amalgam that readily describes Scottie’s plight and
  aspirations.</p>
