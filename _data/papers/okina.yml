    <p>This paper will explore the musical uncanny in the <em>finale</em> of Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor. Several scholars have contributed to the discourse of music and the uncanny (Cherlin 1993; L. Kramer 1990 and 2002; Cohn 2004; Klein 2005; Smith 2005; Péteri, 2007; Venn 2015). Smith mentions the <em>unheimlich</em> E naturals in the Piano Quartet in C minor, op. 60: “the E naturals instantiate the <em>Unheimliche</em> as an indication of the harmonic and expressive range of the movement and the piece as a whole, and signal an unusual attention to that pitch globally to an extent that remains unresolved within the section or even within the movement” (69). He also explains that the uncanniness is eventually resolved in the coda with a delayed tonal resolution (89). I argue that the uncanny is not something awaiting resolution; rather it invites us on a hermeneutical journey and reflects a composer’s private world, their subjectivity. The notion of <em>das Unheimliche</em> comes from Jentsch and Freud. Jentsch’s uncanny emphasizes a feeling of intellectual uncertainty, in which the uncanny arises when a subject is uncertain about whether an object is alive or not, or real or unreal. Freud’s uncanny has a more complex framing as a combination of feelings, situations, and objects, in which a subject feels something horrifying in what was once familiar. In this paper, I will show how the musical uncanny shapes the narrative of a piece, using the <em>finale</em> of the Brahms’s piano quintet as a case study.</p>
