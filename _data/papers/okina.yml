        <p>Risa Okina is a recent graduate from Temple University, where she received her Ph.D. in music theory. Dr. Okina has been teaching both written and aural music theory at Temple University. Her dissertation “Brahms and The Uncanny” explores the musical uncanny in the piano chamber music of Johannes Brahms, utilizing the notion of the uncanny from the perspective of the German philosophers Ernest Jentsch and Sigmund Freud. Her primary argument is that the musical uncanny acts as a hermeneutic window to reach a deeper musical meaning.</p>
        <p>She has also presented at music conferences, including the Mannes College’s Graduate Student Theory Conference, the Biennial Brandeis University Graduate Student Musicology Conference, the International Brahms Conference in Irvine, CA, and the Music Theory Midwest Annual Conference in June/July 2020.</p>
        <p>She is also an active pianist in the Philadelphia Area, where she collaborates with many students for their degree recitals, competitions, and juries at Temple University. She has also performed new music, including works for Temple’s New Music Ensemble and the Philadelphia-based opera company, ENAensemble.</p>
        <p>She completed a MM in music theory at Temple in 2015, where she has been serving as an instructor/teaching assistant since 2013 and was a 2014 recipient of the William A. Singer Memorial Award and 2017 recipient of the Dr. B. Stimson Carrow Tribute Award.</p>
        <p>She also holds a MM in piano performance at Indiana University South Bend and a baccalaureate degree from the Toho Gakuen School of Music in piano performance (Tokyo, Japan).</p>

    <p>This paper will explore the musical uncanny in the <em>finale</em> of Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor. Several scholars have contributed to the discourse of music and the uncanny (Cherlin 1993; L. Kramer 1990 and 2002; Cohn 2004; Klein 2005; Smith 2005; Péteri, 2007; Venn 2015). Smith mentions the <em>unheimlich</em> E naturals in the Piano Quartet in C minor, op. 60: “the E naturals instantiate the <em>Unheimliche</em> as an indication of the harmonic and expressive range of the movement and the piece as a whole, and signal an unusual attention to that pitch globally to an extent that remains unresolved within the section or even within the movement” (69). He also explains that the uncanniness is eventually resolved in the coda with a delayed tonal resolution (89). I argue that the uncanny is not something awaiting resolution; rather it invites us on a hermeneutical journey and reflects a composer’s private world, their subjectivity. The notion of <em>das Unheimliche</em> comes from Jentsch and Freud. Jentsch’s uncanny emphasizes a feeling of intellectual uncertainty, in which the uncanny arises when a subject is uncertain about whether an object is alive or not, or real or unreal. Freud’s uncanny has a more complex framing as a combination of feelings, situations, and objects, in which a subject feels something horrifying in what was once familiar. In this paper, I will show how the musical uncanny shapes the narrative of a piece, using the <em>finale</em> of the Brahms’s piano quintet as a case study.</p>
