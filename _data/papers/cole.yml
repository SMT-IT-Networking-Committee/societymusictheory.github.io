    <p>Despite recent sociological, technological, and composer-specific scholarship on the twentieth-century musical avant-garde (Piekut 2014; Iverson 2018; Cline 2016), analytical tools available for engaging with aleatory and improvisatory musics remain under-established. In this paper, I present an analytical approach that accounts for the listening and performing body, applying a gestural analysis to piano works by Cecil Taylor and Morton Feldman. My approach considers the intersections between instrumental affordances (Windsor 2017; De Souza 2017), pianistic gestural conventions (a concept I develop), and listener subjectivity (Cumming 2000), while addressing layers of mediation in performance and reception. I take a personal, “mimetic” listening experience (Cox 2016) as the basis for investigating a broader question: How might a body-oriented analysis shed light on potential approaches to this repertoire?</p>
    <p>To explore this question, I analyze two video performances of Taylor’s and Feldman’s music, identifying and categorizing “foundational gestures”—discrete, identifiable performer movements that may be observed, described, and (potentially) replicated. Building on this categorization and description, my analysis builds a body-centric gestural lexicon for Taylor’s and Feldman’s piano music. This identification and analysis of bodily gestures, along with their corresponding sounding musical gestures, opens the door for listeners to engage with this music in new ways. Because aleatory and improvisatory works often feature realizations that differ widely between performances or lack a score altogether, these kinds of gestural readings prove especially beneficial for the analyst.</p>
