    <p>Recent work by Damian Blättler, Daniel Harrison, and others has drawn
    attention to the complex, interacting effects of intervals within a chord.
    A wide dissonance, for example, may seem softer when divided into smaller
    consonances, and a consonant interval might be challenged by other
    dissonances to varying degrees. Such vertical effects become prominent
    when a static sonority is sustained as a drone or changes only gradually,
    as in some music by Webern, Messiaen, Ligeti, and Reich. A more flexible
    method to describe the interactions of tones within a static chord would
    thus be useful.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I propose one step toward this goal through a revision
    of William Sethares’s model of sensory dissonance. Sethares’s procedure,
    which is influenced by Helmholtz, computes a score representing the total
    strength of dissonant partials in the spectrum of a chord. In a similar
    manner, we might compute a score of “consonant,” overlapping
    partial-pairs. The ratio of these scores allows us to compare the relative
    dissonance of chords of any cardinality, and corrects an artifact, the
    excessive decline in predicted dissonance as intervals increase in
    size.</p>
    <p>Relative dissonance can take a form-building function, as reflected in
    this ratio. Arvo Pärt’s <i>Fratres</i> shows an arch form with an apex in
    relative dissonance coinciding with the loudest dynamic; this dissonance
    pattern may be more perceptible to an auditor than the process that
    generates it. Likewise, Section I of Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians
    reaches a rhetorical climax just where relative dissonance reaches a local
    nadir.</p>
