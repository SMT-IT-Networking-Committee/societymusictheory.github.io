abstract: |
    <p>Hans Abrahamsenâ€™s S<i>chnee</i> has become one of the few classic works
    of the early 21st century. Yet despite its similarity to American
    minimalism in its orientation towards process, its fine gradations of
    tuplets challenge many analytical tools. Although theories of rhythm and
    meter can be adapted by finding a greatest common denominator, the
    resultant quantum is imperceptibly small (24 subdivisions per eighth-note),
    confounding analytical applications.</p>
    <p>In this paper, I argue for the relevance of orchestration and
    compositional process to the perception of metric projection. In
    particular, I present analyses of the first and last pairs of canons of
    <i>Schnee</i> in which I compare underlying compositional processes to the
    details of rhythm and orchestration at the musical surface, to establish
    the interconnectedness of these factors. In Canons 5a and 5b, different
    aspects of instrumentation separately highlight compositional aspects of
    pitch processes and perceptual aspects of rhythmic processes, justifying
    the relevance of orchestration to both perception and intent. By extending
    metric projection to encompass intervals with slight offsets, as in Lewin
    1981, I show that in Canons 1a and 1b, orchestration highlights specific
    inter-onset-intervals (IOIs) through which one might understand other
    projected durations.</p>
    <p>Beyond<i> Schnee</i>, this work suggests some more general observations
    on listening to music with a strong element of compositional process.
    Although perceiving basic precompositional structure is seldom the end-goal
    of either listening or analysis, it can provide a useful lens through which
    to interpret other aspects of hearing.</p>
