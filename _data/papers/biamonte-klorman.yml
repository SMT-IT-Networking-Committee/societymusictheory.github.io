    <p>As analysts and listeners, we place special importance on closure at
    the ends of tonal works. There are many theoretical and analytical
    considerations of this issue in art music, but few in popular music, and
    most of those focus on harmonic structures. The roles of phrase rhythm and
    hypermeter in creating closure in popular songs has been little explored.
    This paper examines a closing technique discussed by Kirnberger and other
    18th-century theorists that persists in 20th-century popular songs,
    whereby the last statement of a regular four-bar phrase is extended by one
    or more bars. In modern terms, this extension often shifts the final bar
    of the phrase from a hypermetrically weak position to a strong one,
    increasing the sense of closure. This technique helps to differentiate the
    final section (which is often a chorus) from its earlier iterations, and
    resembles the end-accented “closing-theme schema” discussed by Temperley
    and Ng. Final phrases can be extended and end-weighted through three basic
    techniques, which may be used alone or in combination: composed-out
    decelerations, extensions of the cadential progression, and internal
    repetitions. The high degree of repetition, short length of repeated
    units, and prevalence of open-ended formal sections in popular songs
    render the issue of closure more problematic than in art music. This paper
    demonstrates that 20th-century popular songwriters sometimes adopted a
    much older strategy for achieving conclusive endings, and suggests that
    phrase structure and hypermeter in popular songs are less regular than has
    been generally assumed.</p>
