title: "Tonal Pairing as a Strategy of Lyrical Time: Anton Webern’s <i>Langsamer Satz</i> (1905)"

abstract: |
  <p>Completed in June 1905 as one of the earliest large-scale works that Anton
  Webern produced under the tutelage of Arnold Schoenberg, the <i>Langsamer
  Satz</i> is an early demonstration of Webern’s concern for lyrical time. This
  perspective will be explored through the concept of “tonal pairing.” In
  contradistinction to the more common conception of tonal pairings as instances
  of “directional tonality” (works that begin and end in different keys), I
  argue that Webern was concerned with maintaining C minor and E-flat major
  throughout the whole work, as two tonics operating simultaneously on the same
  hierarchical level—a harmonic practice which I wish to describe as “attenuated
  tonality.” Bringing Schenkerian analysis and neo-Riemannian transformations
  into dialogue with each other, this paper discerns four strategies and devices
  through which the quartet defies the germination of any of the teleological
  impulses ingrained in Schenker’s <i>Ursatz </i>paradigm: (i) <i>Kopfton</i>
  reinterpretation; (ii) prolongational overlap; (iii) dominant dislocation; and
  (iv) common-tone tonality. These findings present an ideal focal point for a
  critical reappraisal of the quartet. Rejecting the established view that the
  work’s harmonic language is disarmingly conventional and backward-looking,
  this paper suggests that the quartet can be understood as a critical
  contribution to the Hugo-Riemannian music theoretical discourses in general
  and Georg Capellen’s theory of “hybrid chords” (<i>Doppelklänge</i>) in
  particular.</p>
