title: Sound-Quality Modulation in Sibelius's Orchestral Works
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>In this paper, I analyze timbral and dynamic characteristics in five
    passages by Sibelius and I consider how these dimensions of sound interact
    with form and harmony in post-Romantic orchestral music. Sibelius offers
    vivid case studies. His is music in which complex musical structures are
    orchestrated in highly individual ways; in which form, material, and
    sounds themselves sometimes blur.</p>

    <p>My idea here is “modulation”—not in the usual musical sense, but in a
    sense borrowed from acoustics and electronics: varying the envelope of one
    signal according to the envelope of another signal. I mean this as metaphor,
    as a way to evoke expressive experiences I have had with this music and
    radiate outward toward general observations. Information about form and
    harmony suggests certain experiential envelopes—genre- and style-sensitive
    carriers, so to speak. Sound-quality curves shape and reshape these envelopes,
    resulting in modulated analytical hearings that can reflect listening
    experience, where sound qualities, formal understanding, and harmonic-melodic
    apperceptions affect each other deeply.</p>

    <p>One goal is to fold measurable sonic dimensions into interpretive
    accounts based on time-tested music-analytical methodologies. At the same
    time, I want to suggest some ways that the study of orchestral music might
    draw upon spectromorphological and audio-analytic approaches. In the five
    Sibelius passages, intensifications and relaxations in timbral/dynamic
    envelopes do not line up neatly with formal/harmonic intensifications and
    relaxations. These sound-quality modulations thus involve complex
    processes of amplification and attenuation across different dimensions. I
    find such situations to be of special expressive interest in post-Romantic
    music.</p>
