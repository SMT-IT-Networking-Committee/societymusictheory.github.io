        <p><strong>Martin Scherzinger</strong> is a composer and associate professor of media studies at New York University. He works on sound, music, media, and politics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Primary areas include the musical and choreographic traditions of Europe, Africa, and America as well as global biographies of sound and other ephemera circulating in geographically-remote regions. Scherzinger’s research includes the examination of links between political economy and digital sound technologies, copyright law in diverse sociotechnical environments, relations between aesthetics and censorship, sensory limits of mass-mediated music, mathematical geometries of musical time, histories of sound in philosophy, and the politics of biotechnification.

abstract: |
    <p>How do we frame musical thought in the historical period of settler colonialism? Some key ideas have begun to emerge. The concept of Newtonian <em>absolute time,</em> for example, gained ascendancy (following prolonged intellectual efforts to locate the correct measure of time in seventeenth-century astronomy) and was efficiently and militaristically leveraged in service of colonial governance. Matrices for framing <em>musical time</em> were theorized along similar lines; and, along with pitch spaces, instruments, devices, electrical currents, political nation-states, legal policy guiding intellectual property—instrumentality itself—were standardized and scaled. This analysis reckons with the limits of music’s standardized representation schemes by analyzing musical techniques and technologies that did <em>not</em> survive the colonial assault. With reference to mid-century <em>matepe </em>music from the Korekore region in northern Zimbabwe and <em>amadinda</em> music from the Kampala region in southern Uganda from the era before the destruction of the Lubiri Court, I show how these African cases, in a significant sense, actually <em>invert</em> the abstract relation of rhythm and meter altogether. In both <em>matepe</em> and <em>amadinda</em> music, there is no single fixed meter against which flexible rhythmic activity unfolds. First, the interlocking parts of <em>amadinda</em>, for example (<em>okunaga</em> and <em>okwawula</em>)—both perceived by the performers to be <em>on</em> the beat—elaborate different basic meters. Second, an additional meter emerges within a third part (<em>okukonera</em>) played in the upper register of the instrument. Third, four additional inherent patterns form within the middle registers of the total configuration, each implying a distinct metric scheme.</p>
