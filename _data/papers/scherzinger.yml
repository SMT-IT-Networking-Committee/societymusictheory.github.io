    <p>How do we frame musical thought in the historical period of settler colonialism? Some key ideas have begun to emerge. The concept of Newtonian <em>absolute time,</em> for example, gained ascendancy (following prolonged intellectual efforts to locate the correct measure of time in seventeenth-century astronomy) and was efficiently and militaristically leveraged in service of colonial governance. Matrices for framing <em>musical time</em> were theorized along similar lines; and, along with pitch spaces, instruments, devices, electrical currents, political nation-states, legal policy guiding intellectual property—instrumentality itself—were standardized and scaled. This analysis reckons with the limits of music’s standardized representation schemes by analyzing musical techniques and technologies that did <em>not</em> survive the colonial assault. With reference to mid-century <em>matepe </em>music from the Korekore region in northern Zimbabwe and <em>amadinda</em> music from the Kampala region in southern Uganda from the era before the destruction of the Lubiri Court, I show how these African cases, in a significant sense, actually <em>invert</em> the abstract relation of rhythm and meter altogether. In both <em>matepe</em> and <em>amadinda</em> music, there is no single fixed meter against which flexible rhythmic activity unfolds. First, the interlocking parts of <em>amadinda</em>, for example (<em>okunaga</em> and <em>okwawula</em>)—both perceived by the performers to be <em>on</em> the beat—elaborate different basic meters. Second, an additional meter emerges within a third part (<em>okukonera</em>) played in the upper register of the instrument. Third, four additional inherent patterns form within the middle registers of the total configuration, each implying a distinct metric scheme.</p>
