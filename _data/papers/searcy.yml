abstract: |
  <p>As a Russian émigré and anti-communist, Igor Stravinsky was unwelcome in
  the Soviet Union during Stalin’s lifetime, as was his music. But during the
  mid-1960s, a mere decade after Stalin’s death, the Bolshoi Theater undertook a
  surprising Stravinsky renaissance. Four of the composer’s works were premiered
  in a period of two years, culminating with a successful new production of
  <i>Rite of Spring</i> choreographed by rising stars Natalia Kasatkina and
  Vladimir Vasilyov. </p>
  <p>Research on Soviet cultural life has over-emphasized the degree to which
  Stravinsky’s work was considered threatening to official Soviet values,
  particularly after Stalin’s death ushered in the period of the Thaw. In this
  paper, I show that the return of Stravinsky to the Soviet stage, and in
  particular the <i>Rite</i>, synthesized two seemingly antagonistic forces
  entangled in the Soviet Thaw: both a revival of pre-Stalinist political
  values, including internationalism, and a growth in Russian nationalism. In
  turning to Stravinsky in the mid-1960s, experts at the Bolshoi saw a return to
  a pre-Stalinist past. One Soviet historian argued that Stravinsky’s works were
  being restaged “in direct connection with the restoration of Leninist norms in
  all areas of our life.” Nevertheless, Stravinsky was also chosen specifically
  for his Russianness, and program notes at the Bolshoi claimed that Stravinsky
  pieces well into the mid-twentieth century were still inspired by Russian folk
  music. </p>
  <p>My paper draws on sources from the archive of the Bolshoi Theater and the
  Russian State Archives, including discussions of the artistic committee,
  program notes, and critical reviews. I synthesize these sources with analysis
  of the choreographic-musical relations in the Kasatkina-Vasilyov <i>Rite of
  Spring</i>. In reconsidering this production, I show the unexpected amount of
  debate and change that occurred in the official Soviet theaters during the
  Thaw. At the same time, in tracking the rise of Russian nationalism in the
  arts, this paper traces trends that led to the fall of the Soviet Union and
  the rise of Russian nationalism as a major political force today.</p>
