abstract: |
  <p>In Chapter 27 of the last of book of his voluminous <i>Speculum musice</i>
  Jacobus faults an unnamed theorist for mis-attributing some <i>ars nova
  </i>doctrine to the <i>ars antiqua</i>; he then excuses the offense by
  explaining that the oldest <i>ars nova </i>theory might already seem old to
  its current practitioners. This passage and several others suggest that
  Jacobus was writing at a time when the <i>ars nova </i>was hardly new. And yet
  the earliest <i>ars nova </i>treatise—Johannes de Muris’s <i>Notitia—</i>dates
  from ca. 1319, while the completion of the <i>Speculum musice</i> is usually
  placed in the mid-1320s or ca. 1330. Since the <i>Speculum </i>cites a range
  of <i>ars nova</i> treatises that in turn cite some relatively advanced
  motets, Jacobus’s comments serve as a <i>terminus ante quem</i> for the <i>ars
  nova </i>writ large. But was the revolution really so rapid? This paper
  reconsiders the chrolonogy of <i>Speculum musice</i> Book VII based on
  internal evidence as well as comparanda provided by the few treatises from the
  first half of the fourteenth century whose datings are not derived from the
  <i>Speculum musice</i>.</p>
  <p>It is clear that Jacobus was older than the <i>moderni</i> and that he
  finished his treatise as an old man, but he also reveals that he wrote over a
  long span of time and revised repeatedly to take account of changing theory
  and practice. His notational proclivities are those of a musician who came of
  age in a post-Franconian idiom that was prevalent until ca. 1320. Although the
  earlier books of the <i>Speculum musice</i> probably do date to the mid-1320s,
  the latest notational developments mentioned by Jacobus include semiminims and
  dragmae, which are not otherwise attested before ca. 1350 (earlier datings for
  these notes, though frequently adduced, depend on early datings of Jacobus’s
  Book VII). In Chapter 24 Jacobus even describes several note shapes otherwise
  associated with the <i>ars subtilior</i>, including semi-void note heads.<i>
  </i>Close readings of several key passages suggest that the <i>Speculum
  musice</i> could have been finished in the 1350s by an author in his
  mid-to-late 70s. This re-dating invites broad reconsideration of the
  transition between <i>ars antiqua </i>and <i>ars nova</i>.</p>
