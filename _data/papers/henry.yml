abstract: |
  <p>Embedded in sound recordings, conventional markers of sonic quality draw
  distinctions between amateur and professional music-makers in the United
  States popular music industry. Traditionally, sonic-aesthetic markers such as
  hi-fidelity, lo-fidelity, mainstream, and independent played a significant
  role in determining how music consumers assigned cultural value to
  music-makers and their recordings. However, with the proliferation of
  do-it-yourself (DIY) music-making practices and technologies, DIY
  music-makers, generally attributed amateur status, are producing music that
  blends lo-fidelity and high-fidelity sonic markers, creating an ambiguous
  sonic aesthetic. Building on Zagorski-Thomas’s (2018) work illuminating the
  metaphorical connections between sound recordings, ideologies, and aesthetic
  judgments, this paper demonstrates how DIY music-making in contemporary
  popular music challenges the sonic-aesthetic markers frequently used to
  determine amateur and professional status. Drawing upon Pierre Schaeffer’s
  (1966) and Joshua Hecht’s (1996) work regarding the discrimination of sound
  recording aesthetics and my experience as a sound engineer, I offer an
  analytical framework for the theorizing of sonic aesthetics in contemporary
  popular music. By conducting a mix deconstruction—an analysis of individual
  sonic aesthetic components using critical listening skills—I illustrate the
  shifting relationship between sound recording aesthetics and
  amateur-professional designation through auditory examples of Frank Ocean’s
  music during three stages in his career. The first recording, “Swim Good”
  (2011), represents Ocean’s pre-mainstream career as an independent artist. The
  second recording, “Thinkin Bout You” (2011), demonstrates Ocean’s mainstream
  career with Def Jam Records. Finally, the third recording, Nikes (2016)
  highlights Ocean’s post-mainstream return to independent music-making. By
  examining sound recording aesthetics in Frank Ocean’s music, I reveal how the
  interplay between nuanced sonic gestures embodied in sound recordings
  challenges the traditional amateur-professional binary, instead suggesting a
  fluid spectrum that enables music-makers to achieve their specific aesthetic
  goals.</p>
