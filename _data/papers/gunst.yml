abstract: |
  <p>In 1816, the <i>Maryland Gazette and Political Intelligencer</i>
  published Leigh Hunt’s sentimental poem “On Hearing a Little Musical Box.”
  As the first lyric that celebrated the music box in US newspapers, it
  romanticized the device as both a mechanical marvel and an instrument that
  defied its machinery, with its metallic sound as complementary to and beyond
  nature. By the mid-nineteenth century, the music box emerged as a metaphor
  to describe women’s voices, manifest not only in fictional contexts but also
  in critical reviews of opera singers.</p>
  <p>This paper uses archival materials to showcase the ways in which opera
  critics applied the music box as a metaphor for women’s singing voices. I
  argue that these writers invoked the machine as a mode for communicating vocal
  non-normativity, particularly with respect to gender and race. I highlight
  three ways the music box described operatic women between 1850 and 1852: as a
  synonym for the physical voice or voice box; as a descriptor of vocal timbre;
  and as an indicator of mechanical performance style. Counter to the romantic
  narrative of sound transcending its source, the music box sound frequently
  connoted bodies marked as other. Critics forged this relationship between
  women and machine to highlight what they saw as unconventional performances of
  femininity. Ultimately, the paper asks questions about who is human and who
  has a voice, and how cultural tropes perpetuate gendered norms and racialized
  stereotypes. It dialogues with scholars working on writings about women’s
  voices, from literature (Fleeger, Miller Frank) to opera (André, Preston,
  Smart) to prior instrumental technologies (Dolan, Hadlock), and sits at the
  intersection of sound studies, voice and opera studies, and critical
  organology.</p>
