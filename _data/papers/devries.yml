    <p>In 1970, the Stanley Quartet, conducted by George Crumb, premiered <i>Black
    Angels</i>. The premiere, recorded on reel-to-reel tape, was recently
    discovered and matches early reviews: “big electronic sound of a wired-up
    quartet” (Bloomfield 1971). Early technology could not match Crumb’s
    expectations— the score instructs one to “avoid distortion of tone,” yet the
    first recordings sound unrecognizable as string quartets. This timbre
    reflected the time period, sounding similar to feedback experiments by
    musicians in other genres, and “contributed to the post-premiere christening
    of <i>Black Angels </i>as the “Vietnam Quartet.”</p>
    <p>As amplification technology progressed towards Crumb’s ideal, differing
    performance methods arose: one in which the amplification has minimal timbral
    effect and another in which technology alters the sound. This presentation
    will first define these methods of performance through demonstrations on the
    cello, excerpts from the premiere recording, and performance reviews preserved
    in Crumb’s scrapbooks at the Library of Congress. In order to recreate the
    early technology, Henry Root, who designed the contact microphones and
    amplifiers for the premiere, has agreed to devise replicas.</p>
    <p>The electronically-heightened performances originate in antiquated
    technology, and, despite contradicting Crumb’s written instruction, have
    remained commonplace. Kronos Quartet even has a conscious affinity for it: “It
    was what we wanted [in the 1970s] and we try to keep it with today’s
    electronics.” Crumb, when asked about the divergent practices, responded, “The
    world has so much pain now. We don’t need any more pain.” The second half of
    this paper will examine how the different methods of performance affect
    listener perceptions and analytical readings.</p>
