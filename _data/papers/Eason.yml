    <p>Form-functional analysis has been tied to the harmonic conventions of 18<sup>th</sup>-century European music. However, this narrow focus hinders adaptation to musical styles that do not exclusively rely on that same harmonic language. To address this problem, I look at Schoenberg’s music theory, the original source of formal functions, and apply it to his own compositions. In this presentation, I show how Schoenberg uses rhetorical and syntactical processes to articulate closure in his tonal and twelve-tone music. I argue that Schoenberg’s descriptions (1975) can align with Agawu’s beginning-middle-end paradigm (1991) and that Hatten’s <em>gesture</em> (2004) is particularly effective in describing non-tonal formal functions. Schoenberg explains how middles of themes typically use faster rhythms, wider tessituras, and louder dynamics; i.e., middles build energy. “Cadence Contour” responds to this energy through a contrasting gesture, either with a slow, quiet sigh or an exuberant outburst. Identifying how musical gestures communicate formal closure better informs formal processes in a wider variety of music. I focus on twelve-tone music as a negative dialectic, where the absence of triadic relationships and tonal centers provides more clarity into the rhetorical and syntactic. However, this study can easily be adapted for the chromatic wanderings of the late Romantic to the present day. Gesture may provide insight into Burstein’s “more perfect” cadences (2020). Further, by radically “dis-regarding the tone rows” (Kurth 1996) my analyses show how similar Schoenberg’s cadences are across harmonic languages and that the perception of twelve-tone forms is not fundamentally different.</p>
