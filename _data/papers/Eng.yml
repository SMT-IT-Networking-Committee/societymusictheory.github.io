abstract: | 
    <p>To avoid tokenism as we diversify our canon, I explore a model for comparative study that is based on rhizomatic networks through Teresa Teng’s 1974 pop song, “Hai Yun.” Specifically, I consider connections arising from intertextuality: “Hai Yun”’s pre-history as a 1928 classical choral work and subsequent transformation into an Indonesian pop song, “Mila.” Two rhizomes organize my discussion: one focuses on musical/performative aspects, the other explores textual issues. </p>
    <p>Musically, structural similarities between the 1928 work and its commercial incarnation include pentatonic melodies, beginning and ending in a minor key, and modulations or ambiguous motion towards the relative major. There are also more specific similarities in terms of the works’ vocal openings, melodic writing and cadences. </p>
    <p>Textually, the poem in the 1928 work was adapted differently in Teng’s Chinese and Indonesian songs. Although iconic words are retained, the pop Chinese lyrics change the nature of the dialogue—instead of a lady resisting societal advice, we have a romantic exchange. The pop lyrics also convey a lighter tone. Teng’s Indonesian lyrics are not simply a translation from Chinese, even though both sets of lyrics make the lady’s role more passive. The Indonesian lyrics eliminate both the dialogic and romantic nature of the text, and a particularly puzzling decision is to name the lady “Mila”, an unusual name in Bahasa Indonesian. Considered together with the song’s modified repetition scheme, the Indonesian song strikes a much bleaker note, which I suggest can be heard in Teng’s performative nuances. </p>
