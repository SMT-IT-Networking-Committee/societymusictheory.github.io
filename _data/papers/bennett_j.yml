abstract: |
    <p>The French term <i>métabole</i> is most often used today to designate
    metamorphosing insects, but it has several interesting historical
    definitions, such as (1) a rhetorical device in which a word reappears
    within a passage but is in some way altered, and (2) a musical operation,
    such as a metrical shift or a modal modulation. In addition to repeatedly
    characterizing his 1964 orchestral work<i> Métaboles</i> in terms of one
    or another of these definitions, Dutilleux emphasized the potential for
    such transformations to generate “real” or “essential” change. In one
    interview, he even outlines a precise mechanism: “A certain sound event,
    sometimes very brief and unidentifiable in the moment,” he explains, “will
    settle in the unconscious of the listener and play its role <i>a
    posteriori</i>.” In this paper, I argue that <i>Métaboles </i>enacts a
    comparable process and that Dutilleux’s idiosyncratic use of the 12-tone
    method is crucial to its execution. More specifically, I argue that, in
    the final movement’s reprise, the row becomes a catalyst that sends shock
    waves throughout the piece, forcing a retrospective reconsideration of
    everything that came before. I first interpret the opening movement in
    terms of collections, inversional relations, voice leading patterns, etc.,
    and then move on to describing the properties of the row, which is derived
    from set-class (016) and strongly suggests interaction with an ic1/6
    Tonnetz. Finally, I show how the reprise’s relation to this construct
    reveals a surprising connection between it and the rest of the piece,
    including the very opening.</p>
