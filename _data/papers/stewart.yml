    <p>Even when there is little dispute over the similarity of the musical expression at issue in a copyright case, disagreements inevitably arise over its substantiality. Legal precedent has established that musicological analysis focus on the relative importance of the contested musical expression to the original composition, rather than the allegedly infringing work. For example, in <em>Newton v Diamond</em> (2003) a three-note sequence that appeared once in the original work was deemed <em>de minimis</em> even though it was “looped” throughout an entire Beastie Boys' song. In this later work, the resulting ostinato would not have been dismissed as insubstantial.  </p>
    <p>In infringement matters, when enlisted as experts to provide comparative analysis, musicologists are asked to opine on the quantitative and qualitative significance of the similar expression. But how does substantiality analysis play out in works that contain little in the way of foregrounded melodic content? Does the traditional melocentric approach in copyright that prioritizes melody, and, to a lesser extent, harmony, rhythm, and form, become less relevant? In hip hop and rap, for example, the lead vocal resists transcription of definite pitch sequences basic to melodic analysis. Harmony can be minimal or non-existent. As regards structure, the only differentiation of the chorus or “hook” from the verse may be the return of a lyric referencing the song's title. </p>
    <p>This paper looks at several contemporary pop songs and the sparse texture of their underlying tracks or “beats” before turning to a recent highly publicized case, <em>Gray v. Hudson</em> (2019). Here a jury found that singer Katie Perry's song "Dark Horse" infringed on a Christian rapper's work “Joyful Noise” by using a similar ostinato based on six notes of an eight-note pattern containing only three different pitches. I examine several instances where vocalist/songwriters unsuccessfully attempted to assert infringement based on similarities in rap vocals. I conclude by discussing whether “Dark Horse” and other recent cases signal a lowering of the bar for protectability in music copyright. If there is a new threshold, is it a product of our litigious environment or could standards be changing as minimalist textures become more prevalent in hit songs?</p>
