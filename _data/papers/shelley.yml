abstract: |
  <p>This paper theorizes gospel vamps, arguing that, although repetition—of
  material and of technique—is the most striking formal feature of these
  sections, it is only one of several coterminous musical processes through
  which they are formed. While in previous discussions of gospel performance,
  the term “vamp” refers simultaneously to an iterated musical figure and an
  entire formal unit, I use the ubiquity of pitch and texture-based
  intensification to clarify the relationship between these two levels of
  musical organization. In other words, what we find in the vamp is not simply
  repetition, but the admixture of repetition and intensification. And while
  vocal and instrumental improvisations frequently contribute to this
  intensification, the vamp’s escalatory effects do not result solely from
  improvisation, but also from techniques—tonal modulation, textural
  accumulation, and textual interpolation, among others—that are standard issue
  in the gospel tradition. Thus, the larger entities known as vamps are formed
  emergently as the smaller musical modules are iterated and intensified. These
  formative modules are the local sonic entities that have also been referred to
  as vamps.  An analysis of Richard Smallwood’s “I Will Sing Praises” will
  exemplify this practice, revealing how tonal and textural modulation form this
  song’s vamp, shaping a discursive flow by iterating the song’s title lyric. As
  such, “I Will Sing Praises” offers a representative window into the musical
  procedures through which gospel’s characteristic mode of transcendence is
  experienced.  </p>
