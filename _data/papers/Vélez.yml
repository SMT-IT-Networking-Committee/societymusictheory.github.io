    <p>The concept of <em>imitatio,</em> and, in broader terms, <em>mimesis,</em> has long been recognized as a characteristic element of Zarlino’s musical thought. Haar (1971) and Feldman (1995) examine classical notions of <em>imitatio</em> in discussions about fugue and <em>soggeto</em> as part of Zarlino’s embrace of Petrarchean and Ciceronian ideals. Moreno (2004), on the other hand, emphasizes the centrality of the Neoplatonic language of similitude in the theorist’s writings, making mimesis a central epistemological component of Zarlino’s <em>musica scientia.</em> Examining Zarlino’s description of the Senario as “imitator of virtue” and his adaptation of Aristotelian and Thomistic theses on the imitation of nature in his quarrels with Fogliano and Galilei in the <em>Istitutioni harmoniche</em> (1558) and the <em>Sopplimenti musicali</em> (1588), I show how Zarlino mobilizes Neoplatonic, Pythagorean, Aristotelian, and Scholastic interpretations of mimesis—or <em>mimetologies</em>—glossing over their incompatibilities to claim terrain for his theory. In this respect, Zarlino is exemplary of the way early modern thinkers approached the ancient concept of mimesis, namely as a polysemic notion that enabled claims to authenticity, originality, and natural perfection. This paper contributes to growing interest on the relation between music and mimesis (Cox 2016, Grant 2020) and the notions of nature and organicism (Watkins 2018, Grant 2020), reframing teleological narratives of absolute music as an “emancipation” from mimesis, their metaphysical implications (Tomlinson 1999, Till 2013), and the Eurocentric character of the “nature” at stake (Ochoa Gautier 2014). </p>
