abstract: |
  <p>Saul Bass’s film titles of the 1950s ushered in a new conception of the
  role of opening titles, what Georg Stanitzek has recently termed “paradigmatic
  metaphor”: the concise symbolic representation of the essential idea(s)
  constituted by the film narrative. In his comments on <i>Vertigo</i>, Bass
  hinted at such a function underlying his extreme close-ups of a woman’s lips
  and eyes followed by swirling and expanding Lissajous figures: “Here is a
  woman made into what a man wants her to be. She is put together piece by
  piece. I tried to suggest something of this . . . by my shifting images.” This
  paper shows how the concept of paradigmatic metaphor, as particularized in
  Bass’s characterization, provides a powerful means of understanding Herrmann’s
  “Prelude” music for <i>Vertigo</i>’s title sequence. Specifically, I will
  consider how the sequence constitutes an audiovisual abstraction of Scottie’s
  search for meaning, foretelling a narrative of fragmentation and reassembly
  while establishing important musical and visual elements of the search’s final
  stages.</p>
