abstract: |
  <p>The vernacular music theory manuscript Florence, Biblioteca
  Mediciana-Laurenziana, Conv. Soppr. 388 has been well known to scholars for
  decades for its unique transmission of the treatise on notation by Jacopo di
  Bologna.  Far less studied has been the context for which the manuscript was
  prepared, “A uso di suor Laudomina,” dedicated to a woman with a name common
  in Tuscan convents.  The collection of works in the manuscript, including
  theory on mensuration signs, intervals of polyphony, and the “grado” theory of
  modal organization, suggests a wide interest in the sophisticated music of its
  time and of the period immediately preceding, the Trecento.  Despite the
  elevated status of the music that the comprehension of this theory would
  enable, it has been suggested, by Armen Carapetyan among others, that the
  theory was of an “inferior” sort, reflecting a lack of learning among women
  musicians of the time.  Arguing against this view are the previously unstudied
  works on speculative, mathematical music theory included (or intended to be
  included but not copied) at the end of this manuscript, including an up-to-now
  unidentified translation of the works of Johannes Ciconia, suggesting that an
  interest in <i>musica </i>for its own sake did not know divisions of
  gender.</p>
