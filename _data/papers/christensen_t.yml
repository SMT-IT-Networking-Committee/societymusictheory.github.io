abstract: |
  <p>In 1722, the French Jesuit, Pierre Castel, informed his friend, the
  composer and theorist Jean-Philippe Rameau, of a mathematical concept he
  called a triple geometric progression. The progression could be read (via
  idealized string lengths) as a series of concatenated Pythagorean fifths: 1,
  3, 9, 27, 81, etc. Rameau became immediately infatuated by this series, as it
  seemed to offer an idealized model of his <i>basse fondamentale</i>, in which
  fifth motion was prioritized. But the series could also be used to generate a
  complete diatonic scale (e.g., F-C-G-D-A-E-B).</p>
  <p>It turns out, though, that Rameau was not the only music theorist to engage
  the triple progression. From the late eighteenth century until well into the
  twentieth century, the series was a red thread running through a surprisingly
  large number of French music treatises. In my paper, I will attempt to
  reconstruct this unknown chapter of French theorizing, showing the differing
  ways francophone theorists appropriated the triple progression. On the one
  hand, there were a large number of “occultists” fascinated by the common roots
  of this progression in ancient Greek and Chinese musical traditions. On the
  other hand, more sober-minded theorists found the progression to be a useful
  means for generating the diatonic and chromatic scales of common-practice
  <i>tonalité</i>. The triple progression proved to be a resilient construct
  that engaged generations of French musicians, forming a robust and
  surprisingly unified theoretical tradition that stands in sharp contrast to
  the better-known German traditions of tonal theory.</p>
