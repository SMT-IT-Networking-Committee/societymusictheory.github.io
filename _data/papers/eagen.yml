title: "Interpreting the Psalms: Sixteenth-Century Centonate Motet Texts as New Evidence of the Composer as Exegete"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In discussing the idea of the composer as exegete, scholars tend to focus
  on text-setting practices. Given the dearth of evidence that might connect
  composers to the process of parsing and preparing Bible texts for musical
  treatment, researchers are hesitant to assume composers engaged in this form
  of exegesis. Given that the majority of sixteenth-century motet texts follow
  consecutive lines from single Bible chapters or liturgical variants, the
  question of the composer’s involvement in selecting these texts seems less
  pressing. This paper offers a new perspective: in analyzing and identifying
  texts from nearly 2500 Latin and German motets composed ca. 1520–80, and
  focusing in particular on the approximately 800 motets whose texts
  substantially derive from the Davidian Psalter, I have identified a
  significant number of non-liturgical centonate works whose poetry constitutes
  a blend of excerpts from four or more discrete psalms and/or cross-biblical
  selections.</p>
  <p>A wide range of approaches are indicated by the make-up of these texts. In
  some cases, the textual compiler apparently chose excerpts based on shared
  word choice. In others, the amalgam of materials suggests some form of
  messianic reading. Musical settings of diverse types of centonate texts add
  another layer of interpretation. Elided and evaded cadences often reinforce
  connections between excerpts. Concise phrases may be presented as complete
  thoughts. I hold that the close connections and interactions between both
  forms of exegesis that produced these motets—that is, the selection and
  synthesis of fragmented Bible excerpts and the interpretive work that is
  demonstrated through their musical expression—invites scholars to reconsider
  that the composer and textual compiler of such works may be one and the
  same.</p>
  <p>In establishing a widespread practice, this paper addresses motets by
  Jacobus Clemens non Papa, Johannes de Cleve, Francesco Corteccia, Orlande de
  Lassus, Cipriano de Rore, and Sigmund Salminger. In analyzing the notion of
  exegesis with respect to a motet type whose textual and musical components
  informed each other’s composition, this work offers a critical continuation of
  David Crook, Martha Feldman, Robert Kendrick, Jennifer Bloxam, Jessie Ann
  Owens, and others’ work on the notion of the composer as exegete.</p>
