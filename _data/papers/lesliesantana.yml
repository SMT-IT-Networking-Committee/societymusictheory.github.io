abstract: |
  <p>Every May since 2008, Cuba has celebrated the Conga Against Homophobia, the
  island’s response to gay pride parades throughout the world. Music and dance
  figure prominently in this event, not least in the presence of
  <i>transformismo</i> or gender performance. The movement of transformismo from
  clandestine parties threatened by police repression to official state
  functions and venues has been taken as a symbol of the success of Cuba’s
  so-called “sexual revolution.” A closer look at the transformismo performance
  complex, however, suggests that it also characterizes some of the shortcomings
  of this movement, particularly its failure to adequately include Black lesbian
  women in its push for change.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I show that drag shows in Cuba are animated by Afrodiasporic
  music and dance: drag queens dance the rumba, perform Afrocuban religious
  numbers, and lip-synch to songs by Black women from Cuba and the US If the
  labor of these women is largely responsible for the affective force of the
  show, however, Afrodescendent women themselves are inhibited from
  participating in the field. Performers and artistic directors are almost
  exclusively male, and the Black lesbian women who make up Cuba’s nascent drag
  <i>king</i> scene struggle to make inroads in the industry. Furthermore,
  transformismo has increasingly become subsumed under Cuba’s expanding tourism
  economy, which has tended to exclude Afrodescendants and favor those with
  access to foreign capital, expanding racial and class divisions that the
  Revolution had once fought to close. Thus, I argue that the current practice
  of transformismo is at least as much a symbol of growing inequality as it is
  one of sexual progress on the island.</p>
  <p>Through this paper, I hope to encourage increased dialogue between Black
  music criticism, Afro-Latin American studies, and feminist and queer critique.
  Given that the majority of enslaved African people went not to North America
  but to Latin America and the Caribbean, the study of Latin American music
  ought to account for the African diaspora. Finally, I encourage an
  understanding of racial formations and sexual difference as co-constitutive
  within Caribbean culture and consider implications for scholarship on Cuban
  music and dance.</p>
