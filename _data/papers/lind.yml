    <p>The video game <em>Undertale</em> (2015) achieved massive popularity due to its mix of humor, non-violent gameplay, and a retro aesthetic. However, many of the game’s elements, including music, satirize and subvert the expectations established by this aesthetic.</p>
    <p>One of <em>Undertale</em>’s most interesting features is the way in which retro music interacts with and against elements of its game mechanics and story. How might we analyze this? Many such analyses use transcriptions as a starting-point; however, the most interesting features of this repertoire cannot be represented through pitch and rhythm. We therefore require a re-think: might we be able to use new modes of representation to analyze juxtapositions, interactions, and subversions between its components?</p>
    <p>Soundscape analysis is one possible solution, with precedence in both film and game music. Film music scholar David Neumeyer suggestively describes the mise-en-bande as “a kind of musical composition, and aural analysis can then be brought to bear on the sound track as a whole, its relation to the image, and its contribution to narrative” (Neumeyer 2015, ix–x). Game music scholar Karen Collins also sees the full soundscape as vital to our understanding (Collins 2013, 4), and soundscape artist Barry Truax, in advocating for auditory scene analyses, uses language that suggests its “detection of coherent patterns” constitutes musical analysis (Truax 2017, 257).</p>
    <p>This poster will examine several moments of disruption and subversion within <em>Undertale</em>, some of which additionally exploit a shift into and out of the retro aesthetic in order to magnify moments of shifting player expectation.</p>
