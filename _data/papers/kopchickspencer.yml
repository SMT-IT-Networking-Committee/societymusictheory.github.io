abstract: |
  <p>In July 1860, the four-act grand opéra <i>Sémiramis</i>, an adaptation of
  Rossini’s <i>Semiramide</i>, opened at the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in a
  sumptuous production starring Carlotta and Barbara Marchisio in their Parisian
  debut. Scholars have largely overlooked this production, perhaps because it
  seems to reflect an embarrassing period of decline for the Paris Opéra during
  the Second Empire. In his work on the institutional politics of Parisian
  opera, Mark Everist (2014) considers <i>Sémiramis</i> typical of the Opéra’s
  conservative programming under Achille Fould and his <i>Commission
  supérieure</i>. After all, Rossini’s <i>Semiramide</i>—in repertory at the
  Théâtre-Italien since 1825—perfectly fit the <i>Commission</i>’s preference
  for classic works by established composers. </p>
  <p>Yet the Opéra’s staging of <i>Sémiramis</i> cannot be dismissed as simply
  derivative or outdated, for the production also capitalized on contemporary
  discoveries in the nascent discipline of archaeology. In his preface to the
  French libretto, translator Joseph Méry asserted that “the idea to grant
  <i>Semiramide</i> its French naturalization papers nearly coincided with the
  recent unearthing of riches buried in the Assyrian land.” Indeed, in this
  paper I show that the production’s costumes and décors were modeled directly
  on bas-reliefs excavated by Paul-Émile Botta at Khorsabad in 1843 and
  exhibited in the Louvre since 1847.</p>
  <p>While much scholarship on grand opéra discusses the genre’s emphasis on
  historical verisimilitude, and Sarah Hibberd (2009) has illuminated the
  multivalence of historical metaphors within this repertoire, this paper
  contextualizes the 1860 Opéra production of <i>Sémiramis</i> more specifically
  within the literary discourse and cultural politics surrounding
  nineteenth-century French archaeology. Just as archaeology itself was fueled
  by fierce competition among colonial powers to claim ancient artifacts and
  display them in national museums, the Opéra of the Second Empire was becoming
  increasingly a living “museum” for older operatic “treasures” that might be
  reframed as French cultural possessions. Furthermore, I argue the meticulous
  reproduction of Assyrian artifacts in <i>Sémiramis</i> exemplifies what Göran
  Blix (2009) has identified as Romantic historicism’s desire for material and
  sensual encounters with the past.</p>
