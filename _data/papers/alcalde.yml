abstract: |
  <p>In many repertories of the post-1950s, boundaries of styles and genres that
  were once idealized as rigid become conspicuously permeable. This is, perhaps,
  more often discussed in relation to the polystylism of composers such as
  Schnittke, Rochberg, and Maxwell Davies. But much recorded popular music also
  exemplifies that pluralism with fluid combinations, challenging, and playing
  with, strict categorizations and boundaries. Thus, style and genre turn out to
  be contentious concepts for analysis of these works. In this paper, I suggest
  one can embrace this permeability, while still engaging with styles, genres,
  and their ensuing hybridity in a pluralist recorded track. I demonstrate that
  styles and genres can be analytically productive if viewed as part of
  strategies for hybridity in recorded popular music. In this way, instead of
  merely asking <i>what</i> these idealized categories are, I shift the
  analytical focus toward <i>how</i> they are merged, emphasizing, rather than
  taming, their permeability. Because style and genre cues can also be triggered
  by timbre, instrumentation, and recording techniques and effects, this
  perspective becomes particularly useful for engaging with the recorded track
  in popular music. I will consider one of these recurring strategies—that of
  <i>trajectory</i>—which addresses the transformation of a musical environment
  associated with a style or genre into a contrasting one through a traceable,
  gradual process. Then, I analyze and compare moments of trajectory in works by
  artists such as David Bowie and Daft Punk, which use, among other elements,
  studio technologies to evoke, manipulate, and combine stylistic and generic
  cues. </p>
