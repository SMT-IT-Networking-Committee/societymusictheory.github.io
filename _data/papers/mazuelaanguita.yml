abstract: |
  <p>Alan Lomax recorded almost 1,500 folk songs throughout Spain between June
  1952 and January 1953. The material results of his journey, which are
  preserved at the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress, include
  music on magnetic tape, but also photographs, field notebooks, invoices,
  annotated maps, letters, diaries, and even the manuscript of part of a book
  for publication. These documents can only palely reflect the deep impact that
  Lomax’s visit must have had on the inhabitants of all the small villages where
  he recorded. Lomax’s sound recordings offer a unique opportunity to approach
  the political situation under Franco’s dictatorship, the poverty of the
  country, and the moral constrictions faced by women through the eyes of Lomax
  and Jeanette Bell, his assistant in this journey. Lomax showed a special
  interest in Spanish women’s lives and his documents contain constant
  references to Bell, reflecting the important role that she played in helping
  Spanish women open up for the recordings and talk about topics that they would
  never have discussed with a man. </p>
  <p>This paper aims to analyze how women, from their own spaces, contributed to
  setting up this collection of sound recordings, by analyzing the documents
  from Lomax’s Spain trip, using a conceptual framework drawn from oral history,
  and technological tools. Bell’s memoirs, scattered among Lomax’s papers,
  contain comments on her experiences throughout their journey, her role in the
  recording process, and her feelings. These demonstrate her connections with
  Spanish women, and are very rich in comments on the particularities of Spanish
  female musical culture. The approach to the lives and singing of women through
  the otherness of Lomax and Bell suggests that oral tradition is a key question
  that must be asked to challenge the loss of women’s voices in historical
  accounts and to place women on the map of music history. </p>
  <p>This paper is a result of the project conducted thanks to the Jon B.
  Lovelace Fellowship for the Study of the Alan Lomax Collection, at The John W.
  Kluge Center, Library of Congress, between January and September 2017.</p>
