abstract: |
    <p>Leonard Bernstein’s Broadway musicals, and especially <i>West Side
    Story</i>, have achieved a place at the top of what Geoffrey Block calls the
    “European Operatic Ideal” of the Broadway canon. Scholars have justified
    Bernstein’s elevation by citing motivic connections in his scores, his use of
    classical and modernist musical techniques, and the serious and tragic subject
    matter. Such approaches, however, rarely consider Bernstein’s songwriting. Yet
    Bernstein’s songwriting differed from his theater predecessors in at least one
    significant area: modulation.</p>
    <p>To make this claim, I examine a corpus of approximately 200 songs from the
    “golden age” of Tin Pan Alley songwriting (ca. 1920–45), analyzing the
    modulatory practices of these composers and comparing them with Bernstein’s. I
    observe three distinct differences: Bernstein modulates more frequently than
    was common at the time; Bernstein modulates in sections other than the bridge;
    and Bernstein modulates to more distant key areas.</p>
    <p>I then consider the dramatic motivations for such unusual modulatory
    practices. Many of the modulations suggest characters unsettled by romance, by
    ambition, or by the bustle of New York City. Moreover, I posit that
    Bernstein’s modulations contribute to the literature that places Bernstein as
    “elevating” the genre through another form of musical complexity. By
    considering modulations in tandem with other aspects of his scores, we can
    better understand how Bernstein’s first two musicals, <i>On the Town</i> and
    <i>Wonderful Town</i>, forecast the lauded musical richness of the more widely
    discussed <i>West Side Story</i>.</p>
