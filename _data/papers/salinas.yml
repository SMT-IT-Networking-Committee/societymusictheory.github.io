abstract: |
  <p>Argentina’s Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional was founded in 1949 by President
  Perón with the mission to “reinforce the innate musical temperament of Latin
  spirituality and offer artistic education to the people.” Western art music
  had already played a significant role in Argentina’s genealogy as a modern
  nation-state modeled by its liberal elites in the image of Europe’s hegemonic
  powers. As Corrado has shown, Beethoven had been at the center of public
  debates on nationhood and modernity during Argentina’s grandiose celebrations
  of his death centennial. Yet, musicological scholarship has traditionally
  focused on native composers and issues of identity and reception in light of
  US relations with Latin America, neglecting the enduring impact the Western
  canon had in Argentina’s sociopolitical history. </p>
  <p>This paper examines the massive “Música para el pueblo” concerts the
  orchestra gave in 1974 to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary, following
  Peron’s return to Argentina after twenty-eight years of exile. The yearlong
  series showcased Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony through free concerts at soccer
  stadiums, and culminated with a televised performance that gathered ten
  thousand people at the largest indoor arena in Buenos Aires. Drawing on
  research conducted at several archives in Argentina, I discuss the concerts’
  political significance amidst the terrorist violence of clandestine leftist
  factions and far-right death squads that led the country to a ruthless
  military dictatorship. </p>
  <p>Enmeshed in this ominous context, Beethoven’s Ninth acquires a different
  valence well beyond the Enlightenment ideals it presumably embodies as “aural
  fetish of the Western world” (Buch, 2003). “Música para el pueblo” was part of
  sprawling cultural programs that the leftist intellectuals of Peronismo
  envisioned to grant the popular classes access to the Western canon while
  reappropriating it in the name of a hybrid modernity that, brushing history
  against the grain, superseded Eurocentric hegemonies. Operating like a
  floating signifier, Beethoven’s Ninth came thus to epitomize a utopian
  aspiration for an egalitarian society that asserted its cultural hybridity and
  rejected both US imperialism and Soviet communism, rendering Cold War politics
  obsolete. A “third way” for the Third World was encapsulated in the rallying
  cry “Neither Yanquis [sic], nor Marxists: Peronistas.” </p>
