abstract: |
  <p>This presentation tells the story of a cassette tape, a set of
  never-released (and rarely heard) songs by Lou Reed, and the tape’s intended
  audience: Andy Warhol. Reed and Warhol are giant figures in the history of
  twentieth-century art and music; their artistic collaboration in 1966–67
  culminated in the landmark album <i>The Velvet Underground and Nico</i>.
  Prominent rock movements in the1970s—notably glam and punk—contended with the
  raw sound and queer mystique of that album, just as Reed and Warhol continued
  to look to each other throughout that decade as sources for ideas and
  inspiration. The cassette in question contains newly composed songs based on
  <i>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</i> on one side, and a curated collection of
  pre-recorded Reed songs on the other. Based on extensive archival research and
  interviews, I will explore the circumstances of the tape’s compilation in the
  late months of 1975. This was a time when Reed was romantically involved with
  a transwoman named Rachel, and Warhol had begun work on his portrait series of
  African American cross-dressers “Ladies and Gentlemen.” Their coincidental
  engagements with transgender identities forms an intriguing background to this
  mixtape, which itself conveys Reed’s and Warhol’s own negotiation of power,
  vulnerability, and permeable boundaries.</p>
