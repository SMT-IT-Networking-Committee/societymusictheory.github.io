abstract: | 
    <p>Of all the areas of traditional aural skills instruction, harmonic dictation is perhaps the most under-researched. This is for good reason: it is difficult to monitor what is going on in students’ heads as they listen, and this difficulty is compounded when the aural stimulus involves multiple voices that together create chords. In the face of this lack of research, the hugely influential description of “Gestalt listening” in Gary Karpinski’s <em>Aural Skills Acquisition</em> invites analogies to identification of nonmusical objects, suggesting that chords can become “instantly recognizable—in the same Gestalt manner we recognize a well-known face, a familiar face on the telephone, or the taste of a common spice” (2000, 119). While Karpinski does not pursue these comparisons further, an exploration of other areas where identification is crucial can offer new insights into harmonic dictation and lay the groundwork for future research.</p>
    <p>I will propose models from four other fields of study that offer new ways of considering harmonic dictation: subitizing, the phenomenon from math education where quantities become instantly recognizable without apparent counting; adult language learning; facial recognition, a model suggested by Karpinski; and figure-ground differentiation, as described in Gestalt psychology. I will explore the research about these models and their implications for aural skills pedagogy, then explore figure-ground differentiation in more detail.</p>
