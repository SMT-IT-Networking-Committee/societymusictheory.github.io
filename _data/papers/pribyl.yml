  <p>“<i>Follies</i> is about age and aging,” wrote Martin Gottfried in his
  <i>Women’s Wear Daily</i> review of Stephen Sondheim’s 1971 musical. The book,
  music, and staging of <i>Follies</i> forced audiences to confront the
  emotional and bodily effects of aging on musical theatre performers. By
  framing <i>Follies</i> around aging, co-directors Michael Bennett and Harold
  Prince inadvertently engaged with contemporary discourse around sexism and
  aging, such as Susan Sontag’s “The Double Standard of Aging” (1972) and Simone
  de Beauvoir’s <i>The Coming of Age</i> (1970). Like <i>Follies</i>, these two
  works challenge the commonplace notion that, for women, age leads to
  diminished value.</p>
  <p>Through a combination of archival sources (reviews, interviews,
  photographs, correspondence) and analysis of surviving video and audio of the
  original production, this paper explores how <i>Follies</i> interrogated the
  figure of the aging female in contemporary society. The dramaturgical method
  of the musical contrasted older performers and their characters with embodied
  versions of their younger selves. While this technique was used for both men
  and women, gendered expectations for “aging gracefully” and the female-centric
  nature of the <i>Follies</i> combined to drive the focus towards the women in
  the show. </p>
  <p>Specific musical numbers in <i>Follies</i> played with these contrasts of
  youth and age in different ways. In “The Girls Upstairs,” present and past
  existed simultaneously through the contrasting sounds of older female voices
  and their youthful counterparts. The production number “Who’s that Woman?”
  deconstructed notions of nostalgia in a merciless exploration of the aging
  body by way of tap dance, a style recently renewed by the feel-good, nostalgic
  musical <i>No, No Nanette</i> (1971). The smaller dance routine “Bolero
  d’Amour” pushed <i>Follies</i> contrast of youth and age into a more lyrical,
  reflective dimension. </p>
  <p><i>Follies</i> centered on the theme of aging, but the production did not
  simply mimic normative paradigms. In this show, age equals wisdom, and the
  “follies of youth” are what bring long-term suffering. While certain elements,
  such as set design and choreography, highlighted the aging body’s limitations,
  the women of <i>Follies</i> audaciously proved they were “still here” and that
  older women are funny, sexy, and most of all, entertaining. </p>
