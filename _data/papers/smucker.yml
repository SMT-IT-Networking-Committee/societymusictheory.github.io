abstract: |
    <p>Implementing a new music theory curriculum involves more than the
    details of course design. Curricular changes may impact multiple faculty
    members and areas of study across a department, conservatory, or school of
    music, whether the program is highly integrated or isolated. Proposing
    such changes must involve careful consideration of both the process and
    impact beyond the theory classroom. In this paper, I draw on my experience
    as a music theory instructor, course coordinator, and theory area
    administrator to highlight common challenges of implementing a new theory
    curriculum. Specifically, I use the decentralization of chorale-style
    components in a music theory curriculum as a case-study.</p>
    <p>Drawing on interviews and surveys of administrators, students, and
    music theory instructors across multiple institutions, I employ two
    primary perspectives throughout the paper. The first is as a music theory
    instructor addressing administrators and colleagues regarding potential
    impacts on courses both inside and outside the theory curriculum, while
    the second is as an administrator addressing potential impacts on the
    department or institution. Each perspective offers positive or negative
    valences on specific aspects and dimensions of the curriculum change.
    Throughout the paper I examine intersections of both perspectives as
    measured valuations on five aspects of a chorale-deemphasized curricular
    change: (1) textbook and course materials; (2) impacts on non-music-theory
    colleagues and their courses; (3) student reactions; (4) strategies for
    dealing with resistance to changes; and (5) outlooks on institutional
    recruitment, retention, and future placement of students.</p>
