abstract: |
    <p>In the <i>Formenlehre</i> tradition, contemporary accounts of the
    classical cadence typically identify the most common cadence categories
    according to essential characteristics relating to harmony and melody. In
    the perfect authentic cadence, for example, the dominant and tonic harmonies
    of the cadential progression must be in root position, and the tonic must
    support scale degree 1 in the soprano voice. I consider an alternative view,
    one that exemplifies the probabilistic approach to category formation
    adopted by cognitive psychologists over the last half century, in which a
    category is understood as a network of overlapping attributes, and members
    are prototypical to the extent that they bear a <i>family resemblance</i>
    to—have attributes in common with—other members of the category.</p>

    <p>To support this claim, this paper presents a corpus study of the
    classical cadence that reexamines the cadence typology presented in William
    E. Caplin’s treatise, <i>Classical Form</i>—represented here by a collection
    of 245 exemplars selected from 50 sonata-form expositions in Haydn’s string
    quartets (Opp. 17–76) of the five cadence categories that achieve cadential
    arrival—using a family of techniques for similarity estimation and
    clustering pioneered by psychologist Amos Tversky. My findings suggest that
    category systems for the classical cadence are psychologically relevant if
    they mirror the structure of attributes encountered in a given repertory
    that listeners are likely to learn and remember, where category membership
    is determined not by essential features, but by family resemblance.</p>
