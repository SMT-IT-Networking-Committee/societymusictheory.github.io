        <p>David Sears is Assistant Professor in Interdisciplinary Arts at Texas Tech University. He directs the Performing Arts Research Lab (PeARL) with Dr. Peter Martens. His research interests include music perception and cognition, computational approaches to music theory and analysis, emotion and psychophysiology, and sensorimotor synchronization.</p>
        <p>Recent publications have appeared in the <em>Journal of Mathematics and Music</em>, <em>Music Perception</em>, <em>Psychology of Music</em>, the <em>Journal of New Music Research</em>, the <em>International Journal of Psychophysiology</em>, the <em>Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>, and <em>Eighteenth-Century Music</em>, as well as in edited volumes devoted to corpus musicology and theories of classical form. He also continues to present research at conferences related to music perception and cognition (ICMPC, SMPC, ESCOM), music information retrieval (ISMIR, CMMR, MML), and music theory and analysis (SMT, EuroMAC).</p>

abstract: |
    <p>Using tree diagrams to visualize reductions of the musical surface, Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) argued that (1) temporal successions of (primarily tertian) sonorities follow a logical order (or <em>syntax</em>); and (2) the stability relations characterizing this syntax apply recursively to produce complex, emergent hierarchies, such that a triad at one level—say, for example, the tonic—nests (or subsumes) sonorities at lower levels—the dominant or predominant. Despite recent strides by the corpus linguistics community to discover potentially analogous organizational principles in natural languages using data-driven methods (e.g., Evert 2009), applications of statistical modeling procedures in music research have yet to gain sufficient traction. Thus, this study considers whether corpus-driven methods can discover (1) the syntactic progressions that characterize a given idiom; and (2) the recursive hierarchy by which certain harmonies are more stable than others.</p>
