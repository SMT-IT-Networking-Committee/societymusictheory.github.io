    <p>Using tree diagrams to visualize reductions of the musical surface, Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) argued that (1) temporal successions of (primarily tertian) sonorities follow a logical order (or <em>syntax</em>); and (2) the stability relations characterizing this syntax apply recursively to produce complex, emergent hierarchies, such that a triad at one level—say, for example, the tonic—nests (or subsumes) sonorities at lower levels—the dominant or predominant. Despite recent strides by the corpus linguistics community to discover potentially analogous organizational principles in natural languages using data-driven methods (e.g., Evert 2009), applications of statistical modeling procedures in music research have yet to gain sufficient traction. Thus, this study considers whether corpus-driven methods can discover (1) the syntactic progressions that characterize a given idiom; and (2) the recursive hierarchy by which certain harmonies are more stable than others.</p>
