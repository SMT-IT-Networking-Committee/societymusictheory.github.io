abstract: |
  <p>The growing interest in the study of “global” opera has led to the
  recycling of some of the more modish concepts of global studies: transatlantic
  opera, in particular, has appeared on both book covers and at the head of
  articles in relation to operatic reception in Latin America. Recent
  scholarship outside musicology, however, has argued that the concept of the
  transatlantic itself risks perpetuating a focus on centre-periphery relations,
  in a way that reinforces the prevailing movement of scholarship from
  Anglo-American centers of epistemological power. Could we therefore rethink
  the history of operatic circulation in terms that more closely describe the
  experiences of audiences and musicians alike?</p>
  <p>In this paper, I will examine the rich operatic relationship between Lima,
  Peru, and the cities of Valparaíso and Santiago in Chile. Since late colonial
  times there had been a strong commercial and cultural connection between these
  locations and others in the South Pacific, sustained by a network deriving
  from Lima’s position as the colonial capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. As
  ports like Valparaíso and Guayaquil subsequently grew in importance in the
  decades after independence, existing maritime networks were cultivated with
  renewed energy by each of the newly independent countries of Chile, Peru, and
  Ecuador.</p>
  <p>While operatic performances in Lima and Santiago in these decades could
  easily be seen in terms of transatlantic reception (given the origins of the
  works being performed, and many of the singers and artists who performed
  them), this frame of the “transatlantic,” I argue, obscures the importance of
  alternative networks. Local artists joined the touring companies in their
  travels through nearby cities, for example, sometimes taking on important
  musical or administrative roles. Companies also moved back and forth between
  these cities for lengthy periods, and European artists sometimes took up
  residence. Newspapers and reviews from city to city arrived sometimes before
  the artists did, meanwhile, and thus a local network of opinions was as
  important as the references from abroad. Opera in Latin America, in other
  words, was shaped as much by local developments and people, and their own
  internal circulations, as by European influences.</p>
