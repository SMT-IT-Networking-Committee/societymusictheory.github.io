    <p>This talk reflects upon my experiences of being told that I was "not a real music theorist" or "not doing music theory." These experiences date back to the earliest days of my involvement in the field as an undergraduate student, through my graduate school years, and even, mostly implicitly, in relation to being hired, the tenure process, and subsequent work at my current institution of employment. While my identity as a South Asian American and person of color in an overwhelmingly white field is not separable from this history, its primary lineaments are intellectual and stem from 1) the experience of research science as an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, and simultaneously being confronted by what appeared to be the pseudo-scientific aspects of modern English-language music theory; 2) my encounters with the broader humanities, critical theory, Marxism, and labor and political organizing while in graduate school, which led to the formation of a scholarly ideal that diverged from the then-prevalent norms in music theory; and 3) the subordination of music-theoretical claims and inquiries to hermeneutic, historical, and political-economic ones in most of my work. My affiliation to music theory is strongest with what Fred Maus has described to me as the "fringe culture of the SMT": a capacious margin that includes a (for some) bewildering diversity of post-paradigmatic scholarly approaches to the study of music. Increasingly, that post-paradigmatic fringe is threatening to swallow up the whole of the fieldâ€”a tendency that, in my view, we ought to explicitly embrace.</p>
