    <p>“Genre is dead!” The sentiment resounds throughout current
    popular-music critic-fan and artist discourses, as developments like
    predictive algorithms, professional playlist curators, and ubiquitous
    access all throw wrenches into traditional machines of musical
    categorization. Recent sociological work on the increasing eclecticism of
    musical tastes appears to support this perspective, flattening
    conventional boundaries between kinds of music and classes of people.</p>

    <p>But in this talk, I argue that such omnivorousness of musical
    proclivities doesn’t obviate popular music genres; instead, it hints at a
    deeper shift in genre ordering. To address this change, I explicitly
    theorize the work genre does in the smooth and striated spaces of popular
    music with a new concept I call “#genre.” Essentially, #genre captures the
    adjectival quality and in-between-ness of the seemingly-flattened
    stylistic world of popular music categories by exploring clusters of
    related artists, genre tags, and playlist constituency.</p>

    <p>My methodology approaches this topological change by excavating the
    kinds of linear genre-fabric that Spotify weaves through its platform,
    investigating relational algorithms and proprietary metadata. To do so, I
    use original Python scripts to access and parse Spotify’s metadata,
    quantitatively assessing the various <i>kinds </i>of connections that the
    streaming service generates. I compare these results to demographic biases
    to problematize notions of a “post-genre” musical landscape, nudging genre
    discourses away from conventional phylogenetic cartographies or nested
    hierarchies and towards lateral and multiple models. My methodology and
    conception of #genre show how classification continues to guide all parts
    of the 21st-century popular music machine, demanding a renewed
    investigation.</p>
