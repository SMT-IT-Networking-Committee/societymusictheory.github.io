abstract: |
    <p>In the 1970s, as North Korea prepared General Kim Il Sung’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday festivities, his son, Kim Jong Il, commissioned five revolutionary operas. The younger Kim claimed these operas heralded a new era of music to suit revolutionary times. Recent studies by scholars such as Suk-Young Kim, Alzo David-West, and Heonik Kwon and Byung-Ho Chung have examined the political consequences of the operas’ narratives with regards to national mythology and nation-building. I argue, however, that musical characteristics also constitute discursive arenas through which Kim and his creative workers asserted a Korean identity. Kim identifies such Korean music explicitly in his speeches, advocating for a “stanzaic form” rooted in popular and folk traditions of the early twentieth century. While the form is simple to Western ears, it offers layers of political meaning that are key to the opera’s work in North Korean society.</p>
    <p>Such meaning emerges through a musical class struggle in the song “Here’s An Idea” from the 1971 opera <em>Sea of Blood.</em> The scene enacts village leader Pyon’s failed attempt to recruit laborer Ung Pal into the Japanese militia. Over the course of the action, Ung Pal’s stanzaic song overwhelms Pyon’s bourgeois music, foreshadowing the communist victory of the opera’s finale. Form therefore establishes through contrast a Korean musical identity that furthers regime efforts to nurture nationalist sentiment and class consciousness among North Korean citizens. Despite its apparent simplicity, stanzaic form grants insight into North Korean politics, just as politics deepens our understanding of stanzaic form.</p>
