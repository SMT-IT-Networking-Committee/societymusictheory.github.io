title: "Description-as-Analysis and Orchestration-as-Form in Feldman’s <i>Coptic Light</i>"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Feldman’s late works, including <i>Coptic Light</i> (1986) remain
  understandably under-explored by music theorists. In particular, aspects of
  form linger in opacity, partially due to Feldman’s own ideas: “Form is
  easy—just the division of things into parts. But scale is another matter. You
  have to have control of the piece—it requires a heightened kind of
  concentration.” For Feldman, formal processes “serve no other function than to
  aid one’s memory.”</p>
  <p>In this paper, however, I analyze form in <i>Coptic Light</i> by parsing
  and describing instrumentation and timbral development, showing how these
  concepts directly guide experience and musical structure. The piece is often
  extremely dense, its sonic soup placing it in opposition to the austerity of
  his other late works. But, at a digestible twenty or so minutes in length,
  <i>Coptic Light</i> admits analysis of large-scale formal connections. The
  resulting emergent<i> </i>properties of and connections between instrumental
  groupings serve as dynamic formal agents in this piece. I thus construe form
  as generative, active, and processual. By tracing paths of instruments through
  groupings, I describe an adventurous binary form, replete with a narrative of
  instrumental agents that coalesce into or travel away from their prototypical
  groupings. This formulation helps the listener or analyst reckon with
  <i>Coptic Light</i>’s unrelenting sonic milieu, finding meaningful direction
  in descriptions of musical action. My analysis of <i>Coptic Light </i>shows
  how description of form recognizes and elucidates experiential concerns, and I
  argue we should embrace form<i> </i>as an analytical pursuit for late Feldman
  pieces.</p>
