title: "The Screwtape as Object in Houston Hip Hop Culture"

abstract: |
  <p>Houston, Texas hip hop culture in the 1990s forged its identity through
  the mixtapes of Robert Earl Davis, Jr. (DJ Screw). DJ Screw’s mixtapes (known
  as “screwtapes”) manifested an unlikely musico-cultural phenomenon: despite
  Screw having no national attention and using his house as a studio and
  storefront, his mixtapes were so popular among Houstonians that the police
  raided his home mistaking the burgeoning business for an illicit drug
  operation. But people weren’t there for drugs; they were there for
  screwtapes.</p>
  <p>On his tapes, Screw applied a variety of sonic deformations on
  pre-recorded popular hip hop tracks by artists representing non-Houston
  cities, which resulted in a sound now ubiquitous to Houston. Hip hop
  scholars have mostly used “content analysis”—a methodology that analyzes
  rappers’ lyrics, album covers, and other multimedia imagery—to reveal how
  hip hop music represents geo-social identities. This methodology, though,
  would be unsuitable in analyzing screwtapes, since the majority of the
  content therein represents non-Houston cities and cultures. Perhaps the
  content is not the locus of the cultural work taking place, but rather the
  screwtape itself.</p>
  <p>In this paper I will explore the screwtape as the thread that holds
  together Houston’s hip hop culture. The screwtape is usually discussed as
  merely a medium through which Screw’s sounds are transmitted, but this does
  little justice to its cultural potency. The screwtape is a cultural
  artifact, a commodity fetish, an actor within a network, a marker of
  authenticity, and the emblematic symbol of an entire culture. Moreover, the
  screwtape is an ideal object to interrogate through the lens of Graham
  Harman’s metaphysics of objects, which he calls Object Oriented Ontology
  (OOO). OOO offers a provocative supplement to traditional modes of object
  analysis by suggesting that objects are constantly playing out a tension
  between their real and sensual qualities, and that objects are always
  withholding parts of themselves in reserve. I will offer a discussion of the
  screwtape’s functions as an object from a variety of vantage points, and
  suggest how my cultural and metaphysical approaches might energize a deeper
  look at objects in musicology and overlapping fields.</p>
