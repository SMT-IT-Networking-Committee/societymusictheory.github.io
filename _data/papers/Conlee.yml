abstract: | 
    <p>In 1975, Edwin Gordon coined the term “audiation” as the lynchpin of his childhood musical aptitude testing franchise. For Gordon, audiation entails the comprehension of musical meaning through the lens of theoretical concepts such as mode and meter. Gordon admits, however, that he cannot be sure when students are audiating, as one can never know the interior thoughts of another. When personal and unverifiable acts of comprehension serve as the basis by which a teacher can judge a student’s ability, this leaves ample opportunity for race and gender discrimination to intervene. </p>
    <p>In this presentation, I argue that music theory’s reliance on audiation has perpetuated racialized and gendered conceptions of musical aptitude. Perhaps best articulated in Hugo Riemann’s (1914) <em>Tonvorstellungen</em> essay, Western music theory has historically given epistemic primacy to the interior performance of music-theoretical concepts over and above exterior sounds. In <em>Voice and Phenomenon</em> (1967), Derrida famously critiques an analogous relationship between symbolic and interior representations of knowledge found in Western philosophy. Following Derrida, I posit audiation as a musical correlate to Edmund Husserl’s “internal monologue,” a privileged space of pure expression in which meaning is immediately present to consciousness. Critical philosopher of race Denise Ferreira da Silva (2007) draws on Derrida’s work to claim that the Western epistemology of reason is premised on the perceived inability of racial others to construct and internally represent symbol systems. Following Ferreira da Silva, I argue that music theory’s “white racial frame” (Ewell 2020) extends to the epistemological status of its central concepts. </p>
