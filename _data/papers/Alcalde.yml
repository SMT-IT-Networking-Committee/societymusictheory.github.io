        <p>Bruno Alcalde is an Assistant Professor of Music Theory at the University of South Carolina. He earned his PhD in Music Theory and Cognition from Northwestern University (2017) and a Masters in Music Theory from Indiana University (2012). His research focuses on musical hybridity, the concepts of style and genre, and music cognition, with a special interest on communicational issues of post-1950s musical experiences. Alcalde has published in <em>Engaging Students</em>, has a forthcoming article about his interpretive framework for musical hybridity in polytylistic repertory at MTO, and a chapter in the <em>Oxford Handbook of Public Music Theory</em> on the Piano Puzzler podcast.</p>

    <p>Hybrid music, including the polystylistic repertory, mashups, and sample-based music, prioritizes the combinations of styles, genres, and other identity markers. Do listeners identify the presence of multiple styles and genres, and how? I approach this question by exploring a corpus of fifty episodes from the <em>Piano Puzzler</em> podcast. <em>Piano Puzzler</em> is a public radio game show that focuses on piano pieces composed by Bruce Adolphe in which the melody of a popular tune is camouflaged within the style of a composer from the concert tradition. The episodes offer a valuable record of structured interactions with musical hybridity, in which participants verbalize and act upon informed ideas about musical categories and their mixture. </p>
    <p>Most participants (74%) either guessed the style of the composer first or only guessed the style, highlighting the importance of recognizing the style in order to parse the camouflaged melody. To investigate this further, I analyzed the dialogues for the participants’ conceptualization of musical categories, the hidden melody, and hybridity. I then propose a model in which both expectation and attention influence the responses of listeners. While listeners need to integrate auditory streams to recognize the style, the identification of the melody requires separation of the streams at surface level. These processes are affected by several compositional features such as tempo, the rate of the melody, and the metrical alignment between elements. I conclude by discussing how the idea of “solving” a hybridity puzzle can be used to understand more about listener interaction with hybrid music in general. </p>
