    <p>Within Caplin’s (1998) form functional theory, tonic prolongation plays an essential role in articulating initiating function, most notably in local harmonic progressions within theme types. However, this harmonic dimension is often not reflected in themes outside of the classical style: for example, over half of the themes in Robert Schumann’s symphonies and overtures begin on harmonies other than the tonic. At the same, almost all of these themes continue to feature other elements associated with initiating function, such as grouping and treatment of melodic-motivic material. In contrast to scholars who describe all non-tonic openings as being <em>in medias res</em> (Lester 1995, Rosen 1995, Martin 2010), I view some of them as nineteenth-century variants of Caplin’s types. I group such openings under two categories: what I call <em>teleological</em> beginnings start off-tonic but return to tonic harmony by the onset of the continuation, while <em>suspended</em> beginnings remain on non-tonic harmonies up to their cadential functions. My categories provide more nuance towards understanding themes in the nineteenth century, allowing for differentiation between instances where initiating function is present despite the lack of tonic harmony, and instances of true <em>in medias res</em>. I further suggest that these categories can be useful in examining a broader range of hierarchical levels and structural parallelisms across movements. </p>
