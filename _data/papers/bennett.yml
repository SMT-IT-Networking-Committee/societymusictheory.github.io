    <p>A “tonality” that comprehensively accounts for compositional practices in
    pop, rock, and related genres has long proved elusive. Correspondingly,
    examining the ambiguities that vex this effort has become a regular exercise
    in music-theoretical discourse. However, the degree to which such ambiguities
    may be encouraged by material factors is largely unexamined: do they result
    from the application of an abstract system comparable to common-practice
    tonality, or from intuitive choices under the fingers, instrumental
    affordances and expediencies––in short, from playing?</p>
    <p>I examine early compositions of the Ramones and propose that this
    repertoire provides a rich case study in this regard. Having tabulated the
    fretboard positions of the power-chordal motion within these songs, I argue
    that the majority of the Ramones’s original material from this period can be
    classified within geometric “grid” topologies, of which the significant
    majority fall on fretboard positions marked with “dots.” Furthermore, the
    orientation of the grid topology correlates strongly with the employment of
    secondary chords, suggesting that the arrangement of frets, fretboard markers,
    and strings on the guitar inform compositional praxis to a significant degree.
    Consequently, I propose that this repertoire––puzzling if one attempted
    Roman-numerical description, exhibiting ambiguous semi-tonicizations,
    unprepared modulations, and free modal mixtures–– evidences a consistent
    harmonic logic that demonstrates intuitive, physical explorations of literal
    tonal “spaces.” Finally, in foregrounding the guitar as an “instrument of
    music theory” (Rehding 2016), I argue that attending to the alternative
    musical logics encouraged by instruments has ethical implications, widening
    our appreciation of music-theoretical norms.</p>
