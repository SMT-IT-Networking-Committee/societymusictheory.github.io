abstract: |
    <p>In 1998, Gérard Grisey contemplated a shift away from the sound-based
    construction of Spectral Music and towards the ‘establishing [of] new
    scales and – over time – a <i>melodic re-invention’</i>. This statement
    appears counter to the original manifesto of<i> l’Itinéraire</i>, that<i>
    </i>‘we are musicians and our model is sound not literature, sound not
    mathematics, sound not theatre, visual arts, quantum physics, geology,
    astrology, or acupuncture’ (Grisey, 1982). Yet melody is an increasingly
    common occurrence in Spectrally-influenced works, provoking wide-ranging
    implications, necessitating organization in a starkly contrasting manner
    to the now canonic works from the 1970s. As a result, the
    sound-as-foundation polemics of <i>l’Itinéraire</i>’s manifestos are
    increasingly secondary.</p>

    <p>This paper focuses on Vivier’s <i>Zipangu</i> (1981), Saariaho’s
    <i>Sept Papillons </i>(2000), and Haas’s <i>de terrae fine</i> (2001).
    Each adopts melody in a complementary manner whilst rooted in Spectralist
    aesthetics. Developing Pousset’s (2000) ‘Post-Spectral’ postulation, I
    show how melody can act (1) rhetorically, engaging with the historical
    baggage of melody, (2) narratively, that the implications of a lyrical
    line within a vertically-conceived form can elicit agential readings, and
    (3) structurally, that shifting away from harmony and timbre can
    fundamentally revise the large- and small-scale formal devices common to
    earlier frequency-based works. In each instance, these works demonstrate a
    reaction to the early Spectralists’ “predictable” methods of composing in
    a scientific manner, and increase the level of the composers’ expressive
    input—indeed, their <i>own</i> agencies as producers—into the creation of
    their work.</p>
