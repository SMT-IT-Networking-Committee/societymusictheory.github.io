    <p>This paper proposes an analytical method of post-tonal Topical Networks. Through mapping Lewinian-inspired transformational networks onto hierarchies of topical characteristics, I demonstrate how topics freed from tonal syntax can relate more dynamically. Accordingly, this paper expands post-tonal topical interaction beyond oppositions, specifically adapting Hatten’s more co-operative troping categories of topical interaction to interpret topical relations (Hatten 2004, 2014).</p>
    <p>I apply this method to Ligeti’s Violin Concerto. First, I identify four central topics: Fiddle, Chorale, Lament, and Fanfare. Second, I introduce my hierarchy of topical realization (after Griemas (1984 [1966])): Elementary (necessary characteristics which a topic comprises, though are insufficient to suggest a topic), Intermediate (additional characteristics or nuances lead the listener to suspect a topic), and Actant (specific characteristics which establish a topic). I then network these hierarchies, showing the oppositions between the Lament’s and Fanfare’s characteristics at Elementary and Intermediate levels and a larger opposition between fifths and tritones across the four topics. I adopt Callender 2007’s <em>Sl</em> transformation to map significant, topically-related harmonies across the work.</p>
    <p>Such a decentralized model reflects broader aims of semiotic theories such as Eco’s (1984) “virtually infinite” network of interpretants and Barthes’s (1974) analysis through networks of “codes.” Through the lens of Topical Networks, the semiotic relationships of <em>Ligeti’s Violin Concerto</em> suggest a new method of understanding form in post-tonal music.</p>
