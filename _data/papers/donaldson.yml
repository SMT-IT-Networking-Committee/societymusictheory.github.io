Topic"

abstract: |
    <p>This paper introduces a model of topics as a dynamic interactive
    process in post-tonal music. A freedom from tonal syntax allows a larger
    range of potential topical relationships. To analyze these, I introduce
    the analytical method of Topical Networks. First, I establish topical
    hierarchies (the Elementary, Intermediary, and Actant levels) and, through
    mapping transformational networks onto levels of topical characteristics,
    I model relationships between topics. Applying concepts from the literary
    semiotic theories of Greimas (1966) and Eco (1976, 1980), I ally these
    models onto broader narrative models. The degree and nature of such
    relationships can be mapped across a work, demonstrating how topical
    interactions can guide expressive form.</p>
    <p>I apply this method to the opening three movements of Thomas Adès’s
    <i>Living Toys</i> (1993). A descending chromatic line is transformed
    through an aligned cycle to become an obsessively repeated reference to
    “Three Blind Mice.” Through retrograde and expansion, this becomes the
    Hero topic; continuing such a process, I create networks of five topics in
    the opening three movements. I adopt categories of troping from Hatten
    (2014) (productivity, compatibility, dominance) to describe such instances
    of isolated interaction. I then trace the changing relationships across
    networks, mapping semantically-significant developments and the dynamic
    treatment of the musical objects. Adding a temporal dimension is
    suggestive of a narrative reading, leading to a reflection upon this
    method within the broader historical context and motivations of the
    semiotic theories.</p>
