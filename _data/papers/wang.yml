abstract: | 
    <p>From as early as Johann Kirnberger’s <em>The Strict Art of Musical Composition</em>, Western thought about musical time has claimed that temporal periodicity and musical salience are fundamentally interlinked—that the ear inevitably expects, even proactively imagines, salient musical events to occur at equally spaced intervals of time. However, this model of temporal experience does not meaningfully account for much of Sinitic music, in which phenomenal accents can eschew a sense of metric pattern without being heard as a syntactic disturbance. This paper delves into the limitations of a Western intuition for musical time and its associated metric constructs (e.g. time signatures, hypermeters, syncopations) by exploring the ontology and cultural ethos surrounding 板眼banyan—a metric construct that divides music into cyclical groupings of equal pulses called <em>ban</em> and <em>yan</em>. Drawing on listener testimonies collected during my fieldwork on 黄梅戏<em>huangmei</em> opera and 歌仔戲<em>koa-a</em> opera in China and Taiwan, I attend to how local audiences make sense of temporal structures in which accents appear to vacillate freely in spite of a periodic <em>banyan</em> framework. I then account for structural phenomena that arise out of the uncoupling of periodicity and accentual hierarchy, including Sinitic opera’s wealth of uneven phrase rhythms. I posit that <em>banyan</em> illuminates a context of listening in which temporal syntax is grounded not in the desire for symmetry and the ability to anticipate salient events, but rather in 1) the aestheticization of linguistic sound and syntax, and 2) a philosophy of changeability.</p>
