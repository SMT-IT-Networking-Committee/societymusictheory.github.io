abstract: |
  <p>When the Countess unmasks herself near the end of Mozart’s <i>The Marriage
  of Figaro</i>, skepticism threatens to engulf the possibility of collective
  experience: “I’m raving,” shouts the crowd, “going crazy! I don’t know what to
  believe.” Then, after a grand pause, the Count initiates a phrase, the
  Countess fills in its antecedent, and the crowd renders the melody as a choral
  texture. The transition between these two scenes captures the difference
  between what Carl Dahlhaus called “the time of action” and “the time of
  feeling” in Italian opera. It is also the difference between Henri Bergson’s
  idea of <i>spatial time</i> (objective, clock-time) and what he called
  <i>duration</i>—the experience, as of a melody, in which past and future are
  elided into a single movement. </p>
  <p>Bergson’s distinction, this paper argues, allows us to trace the political
  implications of forms of time in Italian opera. In <i>Figaro</i>, the time of
  action is also a time in which the world is unknowable, whereas the time of
  feeling delivers a sentimental recognition that elides the plot’s gender and
  class struggle. The shift between these forms offers a template for the
  aesthetics of liberalism. While liberalism, like any mode of political
  thought, is typically thought of as a set of concepts or ideas—for instance,
  that underneath difference is essential human sameness, or that recognition of
  this sameness both generates and stands for justice—it is a shift in operatic
  texture that captures the felt difference between radical otherness (“I don’t
  know what to believe”) and empathic social cohesion. I show how the aesthetic
  contours of this shift continue to articulate crucial political affects in
  contemporary film, from terrorist panic (<i>Non-Stop</i>) to normative romance
  (<i>Love Actually</i>).</p>
  <p>Rereading Bergson’s distinction between duration and spatial time as
  indicating not only subjective experience but also modes of political
  relation, this paper shows how the time of action or of feeling can also be
  collective or singular, dispersed or convergent. In doing so, it offers
  language for bringing the analysis of (liberal) political signifiers such as
  empathy and togetherness into the realm of music analysis. </p>
