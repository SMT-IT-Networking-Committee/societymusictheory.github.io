abstract: |
    <p>Analysis of culturally unfamiliar music, or “world music,” is a burgeoning subdiscipline whose maturation brings a fresh tangle of methodological problems into the purview of North American music theory. How can we analyze world musics in a culturally resonant and ethical manner, and how do we theorize musical experiences that appear to contradict our own acquired intuitions? Taking as a case study tonal function in a Chinese theatrical tradition called <em>huangmei</em> opera, I draw on ethnographer Dwight Conquergood’s framework of dialogical performance and ethnomusicologist Judith Becker’s notion of <em>habitus of listening</em> to propose a model of analysis underpinned by fieldwork and two-way inquiry.</p>
    <p>My case study concerns the phenomenon that <em>sol</em>—the fourth tone in the pentatonic sequences C-D-E-G-A, D-E-F#-A-B, E-F#-G#-B-C#, etc.—forms the final sonority of most <em>huangmei</em> opera works. Indeed, <em>sol</em>-ending <em>huangmei</em> opera melodies can evoke greater structural closure than juxtaposing <em>do</em>-ending melodies, revealing sharp incongruencies with how tonal functions are imagined in Western art music. Reflecting on ethnographic encounters with musicians of <em>huangmei</em> opera, I trace their tonal experiences of <em>sol</em> and <em>do</em> back to several socially ingrained frameworks, including the tonal profiles found in ancient Chinese ritual texts and a cross-disciplinary aesthetic ideal known as 韵味 (<em>yunwei</em>). Ultimately, I wish to suggest that the experience of tonal function, whether in <em>huangmei</em> opera or Western art music, must appeal to the relevant <em>habitus of listening</em>—the particular nexus of social narratives within which a musical intuition resides—in order to accrue cultural resonance and musical significance.</p>
