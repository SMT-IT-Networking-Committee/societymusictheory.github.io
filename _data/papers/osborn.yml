abstract: |
    <p>Publications on form in popular music have assumed the formal sections
    germane to pop-rock (especially verse, prechorus, and chorus) to be the formal
    designs of “popular music.” But the most popular music of our time—music
    charting on the Billboard Top 40—has now absorbed the influence of electronic
    dance music (EDM) in a way that has fundamentally changed its formal
    structure. These songs still have verses, but they forgo prechorus and chorus
    in favor of “riser” and “drop” functions (Peres 2016). Furthermore, EDM forms
    almost never contain a viable contrasting bridge section. This constricts
    Covach’s (2005) “compound AABA” design into what I call a “compound AAA” form,
    in which each of the song’s three section groups (Osborn 2013) is built from
    the same core formal functions (Caplin 1998; Butler 2014), but often rotated
    (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006) into different orders.</p>
    <p>I begin this presentation by outlining a provisional history of EDM hits
    since 2011, most of which are collaborations between seasoned EDM producers
    (e.g., David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Marshmello) and A-list pop singers. I then
    introduce EDM’s three core formal functions (verse–riser–drop). Next, I turn
    my attention to “blended” formal functions (de Clercq 2012), in which riser
    and drop functions blend with functions regularly heard in pop/rock to create
    sections I call “riser-chorus,” “drop postchorus,” and “riser-bridge.”
    Finally, I show how producers regularly combine formal functions at the end of
    tracks, resulting in cumulative (Spicer 2003) sections like
    “riser-chorus-drops.</p>
