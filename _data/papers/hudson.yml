title: 'Meter Without a Fixed Cycle: Headbanging 3+3+2 as a Metering Construction'

abstract: |
    <p>Meter is traditionally described as a cyclical system of isochronous
    pulse layers, but I advocate for also theorizing meter as a patchwork of
    recognized rhythms. This recognition can come from having heard a passage
    before, or from a familiar “metering construction,” a generalized pattern
    of rhythmic motion that can be recognized in unfamiliar music. This paper
    demonstrates this perspective by analyzing headbanging as an embodied
    practice of metrical interpretations, and describing a construction of
    phrase-ending 332-family rhythms in metal music. </p>

    <p>Headbanging is active metering (Butler 2006), a process of creating
    beats rather than a sympathetic response to beats that are “already
    there.” Feeling rhythm as a headbanger involves identifying a way of
    nodding the head that is a workable interpretation of heard sounds. 332
    rhythms are traditionally described (and notated) as syncopations against
    4/4. One particular drumkit setting of phrase-ending 332 rhythms is
    associated with headbanging to the 332 instead of a regular quarter- or
    half-note pulse. I argue that this metering construction briefly suspends
    or replaces 4/4 time, offering another familiar way of interpreting rhythm
    to headbangers. Unlike some other uses of 332 rhythms in metal music, the
    association between this drumkit setting and this way of moving is stable
    enough that if used “out of phase” it can displace or reset a 4/4
    “background” meter. The 332 construction is not a rhythmic dissonance, but
    a border in a patchwork of recognized rhythms, a moment of transition
    between two metering constructions.</p>
