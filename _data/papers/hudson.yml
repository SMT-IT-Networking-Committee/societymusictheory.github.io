      bio: |
        <p>Stephen S. Hudson is an emerging expert in metal music, focusing on embodied experience of fans and musicians. His articles on form and meter in metal music appears in recent or forthcoming publications in <em>Music Theory Online</em> and <em>Music Theory Spectrum</em>, and he has book reviews forthcoming in <em>Journal of Music Theory</em> and <em>Integral</em>. He is currently writing a book manuscript titled <em>Black Amps Tear the Sky: The Impact of Heaviness in Metal Music</em>. He is also an advocate for increasing the inclusivity and accessibility of music theory pedagogy by teaching popular music of all styles. Stephen is an avid baroque cellist, and his dissertation studied embodied meter in metal, baroque, and classical styles.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>Several scholars (especially Philip Ewell) have recently advocated decentering classical music repertoire and analytical concepts in music theory, both to make the field more inclusive and to create more diverse and robust student outcomes. Some obstacles stand in the way of professors wanting to include new traditions and theories in the curriculum: learning new repertoire, selecting pieces to teach, finding appropriate methods for teaching and analysis. My goal is to reduce these obstacles, by first presenting new theoretical concepts, and then providing a unit of teaching materials about contemporary R&amp;B harmonic idioms, for both songwriting and analysis.</p>
    <p>R&amp;B music is clearly underrepresented in music theory—especially Drake, who has hardly been discussed by theorists even though by some metrics he has surpassed the Beatles in sales. Contemporary R&amp;B often draws on Jazz Theory to create extended harmonies (9th, 11th, 13th chords). These extended sonorities can be mimicked by “Slash chords” that add a bass note below the base triad; for example, G/A (G major with A in the bass, or AGBD) sounds like Am11 (ACEGBD). I propose that G/A—and also Am11—can sometimes be a “backwards extension” of G. This chord sometimes seems to have a double function, substituting in for either G or Am. Relationships like this create an “extension-related family” of chords. In Drake songs these harmonies seem to depict a paradox of simultaneous motion and stasis, resonating with lyrics about anxious and ambivalent relationships to create an influential musical brand of vulnerable millennial masculinity.</p>
