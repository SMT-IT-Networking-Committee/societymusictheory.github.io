  <p>An unsolved mystery of <i>Formenlehre</i> is that no writer before
  Schoenberg identified the Sentence, despite this structure’s consistent
  appearance throughout two preceding centuries. I propose that this phrase type
  may instead be an emergent epiphenomenon of Baroque dance rhythm syntax.
  Wolfgang Capsar Printz’s generative theory of rhythm (<i>Satyrischer Componist
  </i>1696) begins with either the same rhythmic foot in each measure, or a
  repeating two-measure pattern of two feet. Printz then describes hypermeter
  (<i>numeris sectionalis</i>), many degrees of freedom by which an established
  pattern of feet can be altered (usually creating rhythmic closure), and an
  aesthetic principle that “the most graceful compositions layer different
  rhythmic feet, and within them balanced proportions are observed in such a way
  that . . . in two or more individual <i>Numeris Sectionalibus</i> a unity of
  order and type of foot are used.” Printz’s examples contain many unlabeled
  Sentences, and the formal functions that constitute this structure’s modern
  definition (Caplin 1998) are often mirrored by his foot-based motional
  analysis.</p>
  <p>It is possible that the basic units of eighteenth-century architectonic
  musical structure are “metrical constructions” (Zbikowski 2008) represented by
  rhythmic feet, not larger phrase types. This perspective creates an
  alternative conceptual categorization of this music (Zbikowski 2002, 2016).
  Current <i>Formenlehre</i> theories taxonomize phrase structures as prototype
  categories, with typicality measured relative to modern definitions of
  Sentence and Period. If instead dance rhythm is the conceptual model for
  eighteenth-century phrase construction, this implies a fundamental
  reorientation of how we analyze the typicality and internal structure of
  individual phrases.</p>
