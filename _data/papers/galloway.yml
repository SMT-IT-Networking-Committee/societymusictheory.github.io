abstract: |
  <p>In 2014, John Luther Adams moved from his cabin in Alaska, his home for
  over twenty-five years, to a co-op apartment in Harlem, shifting his approach
  to composing with intimately sensed places by locating musicality in the urban
  cartographies of New York City. Commissioned by The Metropolitan Museum of
  Art, <i>Soundwalk 9:09</i> (“Uptown” and “Downtown,” 2016), his first work
  composed about, and using the sonic geography of New York, takes its title
  from the approximate duration of Adams’s walk between The MET and The Met
  Breuer, the newly opened contemporary art annex. Adams collected his
  compositional materials by crowdsourcing sounds, an interactive and
  participatory research-creation process derived from digital humanities and
  new media. He invited public radio listeners and new music audiences to
  contribute sounds they personally recorded while walking the eight possible
  routes between the galleries. Drawing from archives of environmental and sonic
  memory, Adams composes with the musicality of these overlooked urban spaces
  that his listeners walk on a daily basis with different degrees of auditory
  precision. </p>
  <p>Based on interviews, archival research, digital ethnography, and
  participant observation as users listened to and walked the neighborhood,
  interacting and playing with the minutiae of place, my fieldwork reveals how
  <i>Soundwalk 9:09</i> communicates sensory knowledge of the city. I argue that
  Adams uses ubiquitous mobile media and participatory crowdsourced physical,
  digital, and sonic geographies in creative ways to invite users to listen to
  the inner resonances of the Upper East Side through processes of remixing,
  replaying, and listening with new media. Using everyday mobile media
  technologies where sound quality is supplanted in order to foreground
  ephemeral spatial experiences of the physical and sonic cartographies of the
  city, the crowdsourced aural experiences and affective sensory knowledge of
  place are remixed, replayed, and mapped. These individual practices of walking
  compose unique iterations of the piece, as each user experiences their own
  sonic palimpsest of the city. The mediascape of <i>Soundwalk 9:09</i> maps
  cultural movement in New York as mobile gallery listeners consume art, play
  and perform the city, and walk the physical and sonic cartographies of the
  Upper East Side.</p>
