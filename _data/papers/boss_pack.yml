    <p>The plenary session at the 2019 SMT, among other things, implored music theorists to expand our repertoire beyond the handful of white, male composers on whom we have focused for most of our history. It is possible to couple new repertoire with new ways of analyzing, but it is also fruitful to apply traditional analytic techniques to the music of underrepresented composers. In this way, we can comprehend how their music is similar to or different from composers in the canon by using the same “measuring stick” for both. Our poster applies traditional twelve-tone approaches, supported by observations about registral and rhythmic patterns, to the piano piece <em>Spatials</em> by African-American composer George Walker. Row counting the piece reveals that Walker reiterates the same row form within each of its six variations, only changing forms between variations. Nevertheless, he finds his own ways to create balance between unity and diversity in <em>Spatials</em>. As the presentation will show in more detail, he creates a large arch form by progressing from statements of octatonic subsets of the row as contiguous row segments in the early variations, to presentations of the same small group of set classes as “secondary harmonies” (according to Hyde 1980) in the middle, and back to statements of the contiguous versions at the end. The poster will illustrate numerous ways in which Walker creates diverse intervallic, rhythmic, and registral structures from a unified set-class repertoire following this large arch, and shows himself to be a unique voice within twelve-tone music.</p>
