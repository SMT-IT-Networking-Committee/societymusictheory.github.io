title: "Lully and Quinault Reading Ariosto: Temporal Simultaneity in <i>Roland</i>"

abstract: |
  <p>In 1741, the Parfaict brothers criticized the opera <i>Roland</i> by
  Quinault-Lully. They attacked its verisimilitude at the end of act 3, where a
  loud <i>divertissement</i> celebrates the union between the lovers Angélique
  and Médor. They argued, “how could Roland, who is searching everywhere for
  Angélique, not know about such an event? Most assuredly, it was not Ariosto
  who led Quinault to the edge of this cliff; on the contrary, Ariosto has
  Angélique and Médor leave very secretly.” Although aimed at verisimilitude,
  their criticism reveals another aspect: a fundamental temporal rift between
  parallel plot lines reflected in the opera’s structure, where the first three
  acts focus on Angélique, the last two on Roland.</p>
  <p>This paper addresses temporality and structure in <i>Roland</i>, arguing
  that the aesthetic choices by Quinault-Lully can be attributed to their
  adoption of Ariosto’s narrative techniques, particularly parallel plots.
  First, the opera’s unique structural bifurcation reflects temporal
  simultaneity in <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, where “two concurrent lines of action
  (Angelica’s and Orlando’s) occur as spatial trajectories, without any temporal
  order” (Gianni Celati). Lully enhances the temporal gap between the opera’s
  two halves with a monumental <i>chaconne</i> at the end of act 3. With its
  cyclic organization, the ground bass replaces teleology with a mythic time
  that collapses past, present, and future, separating the lovers’ pastoral
  universe from Roland’s epic and commemorating their love <i>ad infinitum</i>.
  Second, in acts 1–3 Quinault transforms the quicksilver narrative rhythm of
  Ariosto’s canto I with its repetitive triangular scheme—Angelica hunted by two
  knights competing for her hand—into a series of parallel scenes that involve
  three characters, in which one eavesdrops on the others. This allows temporal
  simultaneity while yielding the impression of narrative separation. Finally,
  crucial information about Angélique and Médor is revealed well after their
  narrative exit in act 3. In act 4, Roland discovers their love—first in the
  cave’s inscriptions, then through the shepherds’ <i>divertissement</i> that
  evokes their union. Quinault thus lets Angélique’s narrative intrude into
  Roland’s, keeping the two plots alive and concurrent. This analytical method
  shows how Quinault and Lully transformed the narrative process from epic to
  opera.</p>
