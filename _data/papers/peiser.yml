abstract: |
  <p>Midway through Rebecca Clarke’s Piano Trio, an isolated instance of modal
  purity in the form of a plaintive folksong emerges from the dissonant
  landscape. The mostly D-Dorian theme emerges gradually from musical
  breadcrumbs sown in movement I and the opening of movement II. This fleeting
  moment of serenity is the nostalgic centerpiece of a work that continually
  corrupts memories. Throughout, material previously associated with consonance,
  modal inflection, and the pastoral topic will return in a corrupted, distorted
  guise. </p>
  <p>Drawing on theories of markedness and topics from Almén and Hatten, and the
  notion of music’s ability to express a past tense in Klein, Abbate, and
  Nattiez, this paper traces the emergence of the heavily marked central theme,
  its subsequent corruption, and the effect that it has on our notions of
  temporality. In the Trio, these ideas are manifested through the juxtaposition
  of various alternative pitch collections; the trajectory of clear-cut formal
  constructions to something less definable; and the altered recalls and
  juxtaposition of thematic material across movements. Pitch collections and
  themes often manifest as identifiable topics, often militaristic, that guide
  one through shifting temporal boundaries. In a larger sense, though, it is the
  contrast between the comparably consonant folk topics and the aggressively
  dissonant surrounding material that is essential to the narrative analysis.
  Supporting these structural elements, biographical details of Clarke, cultural
  and social climates, and a potential musical homage to George Butterworth are
  also explored to contextualize and outline a narrative of temporality and
  nostalgia for pre-War England.</p>
