abstract: |
    <p>While Caroline Shaw is perhaps best known for her Partita for 8 Voices
    (2012), her instrumental works have received less attention. In response, my
    project develops a close reading of her string quartet <i>Punctum</i> (2009,
    revised 2013). Like <i>Gustave Le Gray</i> (2012) and <i>Entr’acte</i> (2011),
    <i>Punctum</i> references another composer’s work: J.S. Bach’s chorale
    harmonizations of “<i>Herzlich thut mich verlangen</i>” in the St. Matthew
    Passion. <i>Punctum</i> contains an additional literary allusion to Roland
    Barthes’s (1980) meditation on photography, <i>Camera Lucida</i>. In fact,
    Shaw borrows the term <i>punctum</i> from Barthes (Shaw 2013). Drawing on
    David Lewin’s (1986) model of musical expectation and perception, Perle’s
    (1990) concept of windows of order and disorder, and Shaw’s prefatory
    comments, I explore how Bach’s chorale and Barthes’s interpretation of
    photography influence the formal, harmonic, and motivic structure of
    <i>Punctum</i>.</p> 
    <p>My analysis suggests two ways of hearing <i>Punctum</i>. The first hearing
    focuses on a series of underlying symmetrical relationships at various
    structural levels: obscured large-scale repetition, local harmonic
    palindromes, and an opposition between sharps and flats. The second hearing
    concentrates on the progressive push toward the chorale quotation at the
    quartet’s climax—a quotation that is repeatedly prepared but denied throughout
    the quartet. By untangling the quartet’s intertextual allusions, I model an
    analytical approach for Shaw’s quotation-based pieces and offer a new
    perspective on a lesser-known work by a leading contemporary composer.</p>
