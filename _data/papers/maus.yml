abstract: |
    <p>In the 1970s, music theory increasingly defined itself as a separate field of scholarly research, the trend culminating in the creation of the Society for Music Theory in 1977. A symposium on music theory, delivered to the American Musicological Society and College Music Society in 1976 and published in <em>College Music Symposium</em>, shows some of the thinking that led to this consolidation. Allen Forte, Carlton Gamer, Carl Schachter, Peter Westergaard, Vernon Kliewer, and Richmond Browne gave a range of ideas about the current state and future promise of music theory.</p>
    <p>In these papers, the role of musical experience varies; considerations of embodiment are absent. I give attention to other conceptions of music theory from the same time, drawing on the work of Alexandra Pierce, Pauline Oliveros, and Helen Bonny. Pierce, a composer and theorist, was active in the Society for Music Theory, though her emphasis on embodiment as a way of understanding music did not become a mainstream concern. Oliveros and Bonny never interacted with SMT. Oliveros’s theories about music consciousness are very general; they find realization in many fascinating activities, her <em>Sonic Meditations</em> and <em>Deep Listening Pieces</em>, which bring together ear-training and creativity. Helen Bonny’s music therapy practices involve classical music listening, with implications for theories of musical meaning and musical narrative. From these examples, I ask how professional music theory might have taken a very different course from its inception.</p>
