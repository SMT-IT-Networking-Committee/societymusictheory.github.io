  <p>On 14 October 1662, the opera impresario Vettor Grimani Calergi wrote from
  Venice to Prince Mattias de’ Medici in Florence to discuss the singers for the
  upcoming opera season. He put in a particular plea for Mattias to intervene
  with his brother, the Prince Cardinal Gio: Carlo de’ Medici, in order that the
  Cardinal’s black slave could participate. Above and beyond the moor’s
  “esteemed virtue” as a singer, Grimani professed interest in the novelty of
  his character, explaining that what perhaps in Florence had become “ordinary,”
  would be “new, and never before seen” on the Venetian stage. </p>
  <p>While the Cardinal’s slave is named merely “il Moro” in this letter, he is
  identifiable from other sources as Gio(vannino) Buonaccorsi, and his presence
  in Florence can be traced through a surprisingly rich archive of payment
  records, libretti, scores, descriptions, letters, costume designs, poetry, and
  paintings. In this paper I use new archival documents to think about the ways
  in which black performance was normalized in mid-century Florence and the
  means by which blackness signified in relation to slavery and servitude, as
  well as shaping Giovannino’s access to performance opportunities on and
  offstage. I juxtapose Giovannino’s performances with those of at least one
  other black Medici slave who sang in operas at the time—namely Carali’ Moro
  Granatino, baptized in 1657 as Mattia, taking the name of his owner, Prince
  Mattias.</p>
  <p>These singers and these sources raise important questions for our
  understanding of race and representation and suggest answers that stretch
  beyond Florence. In the rare instances where music historians have
  acknowledged the frequency of racialized characters in Baroque opera,
  representations of blackness and of race have been read as Orientalist
  fantasies; and musicologists, in a similar mode, have constructed a fantasy of
  Europe as a monolithically white entity. Following Giovannino from Florence to
  Venice provides a way to think more carefully about race and class in Baroque
  opera more generally, with particular attention to the relationship between
  musicality and servitude.</p>
