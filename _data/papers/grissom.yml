    <p>My presentation addresses the need for more inclusion of women, particularly Black women, in the fields of music theory and composition. By “(re)visioning” the role of women and their contributions in the fields of music theory and composition, we can begin to dismantle centuries of social and musical constructs endorsed by the traditional Western-European patriarchal canon.</p>
    <p>Spelman College has a long-standing mission of educating women of color and preparing its students to be change agents in their communities. This mission also extends to the music department where we are “(re)visioning” our music curriculum that has historically promoted performance over other musical fields. By implementing curricula changes that promote more Black women to become music “creators” and composers, we are changing the narrative of Black women in music, while creating a new pool of music theorist/composers in the higher education workforce.</p>
