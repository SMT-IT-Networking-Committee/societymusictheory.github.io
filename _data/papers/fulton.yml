abstract: |
    <p>The program note to Caroline Shaw’s Pulitzer-prize-winning <i>Partita
    for 8 Voices</i> (2012) includes an unusual instruction: prompted by
    uproarious reaction at its premiere to an “explosive” D-major reprise
    in the final movement, listeners are encouraged to “holler or clap any
    time you feel like it.” These and other embodied reactions to the
    piece are a kind of mimetic engagement  (Cox 2011; 2016). The
    <i>Partita</i>’s invitation to mimetic engagement is made particularly
    strong by its unusual vocal techniques. Shaw plays with the “edges” of
    the voice, weaving into the music a physicality that Western classical
    vocal technique often diminishes. Mimetic engagement can manifest as
    identification with a performer (Heidemann 2016), but with multiple
    voices, Shaw’s <i>Partita</i> lacks this focal point. Instead, mimetic
    engagement informs the perceived relationship between performative
    action and “the music itself.” In this analysis I draw both from Cox
    and from Eric Clarke’s notion of a musical “virtual world” (Clarke
    2005), understanding “the music” as a separable energy or plane of
    existence, rather than equivalent to performative action. I present
    two possible relationships between music and performance: performance
    <i>unveiling</i> the music, and music and performer mutually
    <i>striving </i>for each other. I focus primarily on the second
    movement ("Sarabande") for examples of each, and conclude with an
    exploration of the D-major reprise of "Passacaglia," which combines
    elements of both relationships.</p>
