    <p>Many incoming music majors are under-equipped for their first written theory courses. This situation presents significant pedagogical challenges for instructors and can cause students to struggle intensely if they enter a course that they are not prepared for. Weaker students may develop an undue lack of confidence if they compare themselves to their peers, and stronger students can become disillusioned if they do not feel sufficiently challenged.</p>
    <p>This poster presents a fundamentals course which works through all three of Michael Rogers’ (2004) stages of foundational fundamentals—understanding, developing accuracy, and developing speed—within one fifty-minute meeting per week (35). A flipped classroom model teaches content from note reading to triads through video lectures and interactive handouts that scaffold the learning experience (Shafer 2018), and concepts of spaced practice and retrieval practice (Lang 2016; Miller 2014) and interleaving (Callahan 2019) are used to design homework. Practice is gamified through screen names, leader boards, and a “token” which forgives missing homework grades.</p>
    <p>This structure allows students with little or no background to achieve a strong grasp of fundamentals within a one-credit course, and allows stronger students to complete course requirements early if they are ready to do so. These methods create a classroom experience that welcomes all students, regardless of background, and equips them with both the basic tools <em>and</em> the confidence that they will need to succeed in their coursework.</p>
