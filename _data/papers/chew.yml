abstract: |
    <p>Music notation normally presents an abstract notion of time that
    largely ignores performed tempi, rhythms, and timing (rubato, agogic
    accents, and pauses). This has led to a schism between music as notated
    (in score time) and music as performed (in real time). I shall describe a
    series of experiments demonstrating a range of unconventional treatments
    of common music notation (CMN). In Practicing Haydn (2013), created in
    collaboration with composer Peter Child and conceptual artist Lina Viste
    Grønli, my sight-reading of a Haydn sonata movement is meticulously
    transcribed into a performable score, complete with all the starts and
    stops, errors and repetitions. In Stolen Rhythm (2009), Cheryl
    Frances-Hoad’s rapid-paced re-notation of the same sonata movement
    suggests a different hearing of Haydn’s original work. In pieces created
    by MorpheuS (2016) the optimization software, a collaboration with Dorien
    Herremans, re-assignments of pitches to template rhythms hard constrained
    to follow recurrent patterns and mimic tonal tension profiles of an
    existing piece re-forms familiar pieces to create alternate musical
    universes. In Stolen Heartbeats (2017), electrocardiogram recordings of
    abnormal heart rhythms are transcribed semi-automatically to form rhythmic
    frameworks for assemblage pieces. The extent to which CMN can encode even
    abnormal physiological rhythms suggests new ways to represent and make
    evident the usually unseen creative work of performance.</p>
