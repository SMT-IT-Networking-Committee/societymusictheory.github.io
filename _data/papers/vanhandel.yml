abstract: |
    <p>Karpinski’s <em>Aural Skills Acquisition</em> was grounded in the literature of music perception and cognition, which has exploded as a discipline in the last twenty years.  <em>ASA</em> engaged cognition topics including attention, memory, simultaneous and parallel processing, and Gestalt psychology, and related them all to the pedagogy of aural skills. Since then, there have been numerous studies on these and other topics in cognitive science and music cognition, including key finding, statistical learning, application of psychoacoustic principles to voice leading, and more. In addition, the field of educational psychology has grown, advocating for pedagogical best practices that take into account recent research into how we learn, resulting in a wealth of knowledge and understanding of how cognition relates to learning in general. As Elizabeth Sayrs noticed at the 2019 Pedagogy into Practice conference, cognition (both music and otherwise) played a large role in the research presented at the conference, including the role of implicit and explicit learning on mental representations of auditory images, current research into absolute pitch, and how working memory and cognitive load relate to pedagogical approaches in the classroom.</p>
    <p>This lightning talk will contextualize Karpinski’s <em>Aural Skills Acquisition</em> in the cognition literature of the time, and will highlight recent music perception and music cognition scholarship that has refined the foundation that <em>Aural Skills Acquisition</em> established.</p>
