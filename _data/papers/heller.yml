abstract: |
  <p>In a well-known letter from 1611, Monteverdi extolled the singing of
  Adriana Basile, whose weekly concerts in the Hall of Mirrors lent “such power
  and so special a grace, bringing such delight to the senses that the place
  becomes almost like a new theater.” That Monteverdi would have so lauded
  Basile is by no means surprising, for indeed his comments might be understood
  in the context of a cult that emerged in the early seventeenth century in
  which female divas were objects of worship, as evident in the numerous
  publications dedicated to singers such as Basile and her daughter Leonora
  Baroni, Anna Renzi, and unnamed virtuose praised poetically (e.g., Gian
  Battista Marino’s “La Bella Cantatrice” ). While we might assume that much of
  the allure centered on the singers’ desirability, the focus in so many
  writings was not on the women’s bodies or faces, but rather on the special
  power of their song to enchant. Put another way: were Seicento musicians and
  listeners seduced primarily by the physical beauty of these women, or was it
  the unique sound of their voices that inspired such adoration? </p>
  <p>I propose that the fascination with women singers evinced by Monteverdi and
  his colleagues was a result not only of the beauty of their voices, but a
  certain strength in the middle register that allowed for the natural delivery
  of text so critical in early-seventeenth-century vocal music. Taking the
  various writings on female singers and the relatively scant evidence from
  vocal treatises (Caccini, Tosi, Mancini, Hiller), my paper compares the music
  known to have been written for female sopranos with that composed for castrati
  (giving special attention to the roles sung by Anna Renzi), to elucidate
  hitherto unrecognized differences in the training and vocal techniques of
  castrati and female sopranos in the seventeenth century. More importantly,
  however, it posits that <i>virtuose</i> not only a played a central role in
  the formation of the <i>seconda prattica</i>, but helped Monteverdi find the
  “<i>via naturale alla immitatione</i>.” </p>
