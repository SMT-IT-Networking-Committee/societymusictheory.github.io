    <p>Scholars across a wide spectrum of musical disciplines have discussed how active music-theoretic understanding can affect one’s experience of music. Modern pedagogues often refer to this as the powerful bond between thinking and listening, whereby some form of active reflection about music—its components, its structure, and/or its meaning—greatly expands not only conceptual understanding of music, but the <em>experience</em> of it. This connection is believed to operate bi-directionally as an iterative feedback loop: active reflection about music changes how we hear, and how we hear changes our process of active reflection.</p>
    <p>In this project, I create a cognitive account of the iterative feedback loop between thinking and listening by combining several cognitive frameworks to explain how it operates. These include expertise acquisition and long-term working memory (LTWM) developed by Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch, and Dual-Coding Theory (DCT) developed by Allan Paivio. I position music-theoretic expertise as a form of skilled memory performance (LTWM) where theorists actively build and connect composite multisensory mental representations of theoretical concepts through dual-coding in both verbal and imagistic representational systems (DCT). Dual-coding involves the cooperative activity of language and nonverbal cognitive systems to enhance memory, facilitating growth in knowledge. As the strength and quantity of connections increases within the expanding body of mental representations, so does the fluency and ease with which the theorist can actively recall and engage with them during thinking and listening activities.</p>
