abstract: |
  <p>The development of auditory imagery, or “inner hearing”—whereby musicians
  can create or recall sound in the absence of external input—is a central goal
  of aural skills pedagogy. However, the relationship between traditional aural
  skills activities and auditory imagery development remains tenuous and
  unsubstantiated. Within the field of cognitive science, an important and
  related question remains unexplored: is auditory imagery an acquired and
  plastic ability (amenable to training of some kind), or a fixed established
  trait (not susceptible to experienced-based change)? Given this apparent
  overlap in interests and goals, the aural skills classroom appears to be a
  fitting environment to explore auditory imagery development, to the benefit of
  both disciplines. In this paper, I address one significant hurdle facing both
  aural skills pedagogy and cognitive science research: the problem of
  measurement. To this end, I discuss the efficacy of using a modern auditory
  imagery psychometric, the Bucknell Auditory Imagery Scale (or BAIS; see
  Halpern 2015), as a potential remedy to the issue of measurement, facilitating
  the study of auditory imagery development following aural skills training. The
  primary topic to be addressed is whether a generalized measure can capture the
  types of changes to auditory imagery abilities that might occur as a result of
  aural skills training, as well as the viability of imagery self-report
  strategies for both research and pedagogical purposes. Moving forward, I
  propose that we need to challenge the assumption that it is possible to
  separate imaging ability from the acquisition of imaging <i>content</i>.</p>
