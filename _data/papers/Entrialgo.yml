    <p>Throughout most of his compositional career, Albéniz had kept a strong separation between his “Spanish-style” pieces in <em>da capo</em> form on the one hand, and his more academic works in sonata form on the other. In <em>Iberia</em>, however, Albéniz combined the folkloric materials he was most famous for with sonata form. While the “popular” sources of these materials have been frequently pointed out (Mast 1974, and Clark 1999), their exact integration within the sonata-form framework has been overlooked.  In this paper, I will focus on the role of “Spanish-style” <em>coplas</em> as subordinate themes of the sonata-form compositions of <em>Iberia</em>. All these themes have a <em>dolce</em> expression and are mostly cast as folk-inspired forms (the <em>copla</em>, bar-form, or quaternary stanza). They are “tight-knit” and well presented, with regular and square phrase structures and phrase rhythms, using “compound basic ideas” as basic compositional units, statement-response articulations, and large-scale repetitions; these characteristics are a reflection of Albéniz’s fundamentally lyrical conception of the subordinate theme. This paper will unveil Albéniz’s conception of sonata form and explain how some aspects of Spanish folklore fared with certain sonata conventions. It will also—building on the work of Ratner (1980), Rothstein (1989), and Caplin (1998)—contribute to a key and ongoing task in <em>Formenlehre</em>: to define ever more clearly the concrete musical characteristics, phrase structures, and compositional processes that project the formal functionality of main and subordinate themes.</p>
