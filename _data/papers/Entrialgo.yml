      bio: <p>Alberto Martín Entrialgo studied Music Theory at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam, where he obtained his Bachelor's in 2016 and his Master's in 2018. He is currently working on a PhD at the University of Southampton under the supervision of David Bretherton. His thesis focuses on the persistence of eighteenth-century conventions in the work of the nineteenth-century Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz. In 2019, he was awarded with the Theory and Analysis Graduate Student Prize of the Society for Music Analysis for his paper “Isaac Albéniz as a Galant Composer,” and in 2020, he obtained the UKRI/MITACS Globalink Doctoral Exchange Grant to conduct part of his doctoral research at McGill University under the supervision of William Caplin. His work has appeared or will appear in <em>Music Theory and Analysis</em>, the newsletter of the Society for Music Analysis, and <em>Diagonal: an Ibero- American Music Review</em>, and he has presented papers at the annual conferences of the Society for Music Analysis and the Dutch-Flemish Society for Music Theory.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>Throughout most of his compositional career, Albéniz had kept a strong separation between his “Spanish-style” pieces in <em>da capo</em> form on the one hand, and his more academic works in sonata form on the other. In <em>Iberia</em>, however, Albéniz combined the folkloric materials he was most famous for with sonata form. While the “popular” sources of these materials have been frequently pointed out (Mast 1974, and Clark 1999), their exact integration within the sonata-form framework has been overlooked.  In this paper, I will focus on the role of “Spanish-style” <em>coplas</em> as subordinate themes of the sonata-form compositions of <em>Iberia</em>. All these themes have a <em>dolce</em> expression and are mostly cast as folk-inspired forms (the <em>copla</em>, bar-form, or quaternary stanza). They are “tight-knit” and well presented, with regular and square phrase structures and phrase rhythms, using “compound basic ideas” as basic compositional units, statement-response articulations, and large-scale repetitions; these characteristics are a reflection of Albéniz’s fundamentally lyrical conception of the subordinate theme. This paper will unveil Albéniz’s conception of sonata form and explain how some aspects of Spanish folklore fared with certain sonata conventions. It will also—building on the work of Ratner (1980), Rothstein (1989), and Caplin (1998)—contribute to a key and ongoing task in <em>Formenlehre</em>: to define ever more clearly the concrete musical characteristics, phrase structures, and compositional processes that project the formal functionality of main and subordinate themes.</p>
