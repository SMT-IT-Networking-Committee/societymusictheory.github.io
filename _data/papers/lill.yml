    <p>Most rhythm and meter scholarship that addresses complex meters—meters that include quintuple and larger prime number pulse groupings—examines individual complex meters in isolation, like Justin London (2002) and Godfried Toussaint (2013). Some authors, like Fernando Benadon (2004) and Mark Gotham (2015), have begun to consider how different complex meters relate to one another. I contribute to this topic with a novel analytical method that synthesizes Gotham’s metric relationships and Benadon’s description of tempo- (metric-)modulation into a single graphical representation of complex meters. To do this, I build on the work of Richard Cohn (2001), Scott Murphy (2009), and Daphne Leong (2007) on ski-hill graphs—graphic representations of simple and compound meters that import analytical possibilities from the <em>Tonnetz</em> into the metrical realm—by expanding them from 2- to n-dimensions. N-dimensional ski-hill graphs are ideally suited for analyzing repertoire comprising changing complex meters and especially cases of tempo-modulation by providing succinct graphic representations of those meters and highlighting relationships that otherwise remain opaque. This poster first shows how I generalize Cohn’s 2-dimensional ski-hill graphs, which feature subdivisions by two or three, to account for subdivision by prime numbers larger than two or three. It then shows that by expanding ski-hill graphs into n-dimensions they can account for any number of prime number subdivisions. For demonstration, I provide analyses of complex meters utilizing 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional ski-hill graphs respectively in Gustav Holst’s “Mars, The Bringer of War,” Elliot Carter’s Cello Sonata, and Leoš Janáček’s “Fanfare” from his <em>Sinfonietta</em>.</p>
