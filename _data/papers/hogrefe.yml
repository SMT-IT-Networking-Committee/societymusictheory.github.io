abstract: |
    <p>The first movement of Mahler’s Tenth Symphony raises a formal question
    that applies broadly to all nineteenth- and twentieth-century music: how do
    Classical-era formal categories operate after the Classical era? Julian Horton
    (2005), Seth Monahan (2011, 2015), Steven Vande Moortele (2013), and others
    have offered possible solutions, but little has been achieved in terms of
    consensus. This paper offers a model for viewing form in Mahler’s Tenth
    Symphony that refines Hepokoski and Darcy’s dialogic perspective by
    distinguishing between four <i>dialogic attitudes</i> based on the master
    tropes of rhetoric: metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony.</p>

    <p>In the first movement of Mahler’s Tenth Symphony, sonata form
    conventions interact freely with conventions more commonly associated with
    nineteenth-century slow movements creating a composite form. But within
    this composite, the two formal traditions are treated differently; Adagio
    conventions are largely upheld while sonata conventions are largely
    overturned, violated, or otherwise negated. My analysis shows how Mahler’s
    movement is best understood as enacting a conflict between dialogic
    attitudes based on metaphor and metonymy, as opposed to representing an
    uncertain blend of disparate formal traditions.</p>
