    <p>Near the end of his analysis of Franz Schubert’s <em>Moment musical</em> in F minor, D. 780, no. 3, Arnold Feil (1986) describes the rhythmic and metrical activity in the piece as, “a kind of game played on many levels with musical-rhythmic figures.” Feil’s near-exclusive focus on rhythm and meter in an instrumental work of Schubert’s puts him in the minority: explorations of rhythm and meter in this repertoire tend to be eclipsed by parameters such as harmony, form, and Beethoven’s influence on Schubert. Yet numerous studies of rhythm and meter in the instrumental works of other 18th- and 19th-century composers have led to rich and exciting ways of understanding, hearing, and performing their music.</p>
    <p>This paper places rhythm and meter at center stage in analyses of several of Schubert’s early piano sonatas—those in F minor, D. 625; B major, D. 575; and E-flat major, D. 568—in an effort to stimulate considerations of rhythm and meter as a salient expressive feature in Schubert’s instrumental music. Using Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s (1983) metrical preference rules as my primary analytical framework, I argue that Schubert plays metrical and hypermetrical games by setting up metrical problems at the beginning of movements that lead to rhythmic drama, moments of metrical clarity, and moments of metrical confusion later in the piece. Three metrical games are discussed: (1) creating tension between possible beginning- and end-accented interpretations of themes, (2) obscuring or concealing notated barlines, and (3) odd-strong/even-strong switches.</p>
