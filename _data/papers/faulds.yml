abstract: |
  <p>Around 1800, Britain saw a small explosion in the publication of music with
  accompaniment for tambourine, complicating existing gender and cultural
  narratives. Publications by composers such as Clementi, Steibelt, and Mazzinghi
  often took the form of waltzes and reductions of ballets; however, both were
  highly problematic genres for women. Additionally, instruments of the drum
  family were associated with masculine military topoi and performance, yet
  publishers emphasized the suitability of the tambourine for women and
  instruction manuals clearly yoke tambourine performance with taste, elegance
  and “the most graceful attitudes.” Although Henry Farmer and Sam Girling
  separately situated tambourine music within female domesticity, recognizing its
  postural, visual and choreographic nature, little attempt has yet been made to
  understand how its performance intersected with contemporary ideals of grace.

  <p>This paper explores how elite women’s engagement with tambourine music
  tapped into and jostled against a specific corporeal aesthetic vocabulary and
  material culture around grace. Bodily grace was epitomized by ease, elegance,
  and “delicacy of attitude and motion,” drawing heavily on notions of antiquity.
  Yet despite the emphasis on grace in tambourine instruction, its performance
  required vigor, theatricality, and noise, the antithesis of demure grace. The
  tambourine’s incorporation into the fabric of elite houses, from vases,
  commodes, figurines, and musical trophies through to portraiture, contains
  clear parallels to depictions of women playing tambourines in musical
  publications. The recurring portrayal of women with tambourines as bacchantes,
  and the merchandising of Emma Hamilton’s body and instrument, points towards a
  narrative that sanitizes or nullifies associations with intoxication, violence,
  and voyeurism. In addition to evoking classical mythology, the tambourine was
  also coupled with diverse ethnicities and representations of class, from French
  street musicians, “oriental” janissary music, and black instrumentalists in
  militia bands, to female ballet dancers and the innocence of childhood play.
  Women’s performance on the tambourine, therefore, needs to be understood within
  the context of this complex cultural background. Grace became a pivotal tool
  through which such music-making was both endorsed and promulgated, connecting
  it to a broader discourse around material acquisition, and sidestepping
  uncomfortable gender and social juxtapositions.</p>
