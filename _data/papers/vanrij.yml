abstract: |
  <p>Hector Berlioz’s <i>Roméo et Juliette</i> represents a striking paradox in
  terms of the relationship between body, emotion, and music. The work was
  inspired by performances of an English theater company in Paris in 1827.
  Unable to understand English, Berlioz responded instead to what he described
  as “the play of expression and voice and gesture.” Yet in choosing the medium
  of a choral symphony rather than opera, and giving the parts of the lovers to
  the orchestra, Berlioz appeared to deprive the audience of the visual
  depiction of passion that had been such a crucial part of his own seminal
  theatrical experience. It was the very “imprecision” of instrumental language
  which, Berlioz suggested, made it best suited to the depiction of “that
  passion swift as thought.” </p>
  <p>Existing approaches to Berlioz’s symphony emphasize the programmatic and
  narrative elements of the score. However, in this paper I explore the
  possibility that Berlioz’s <i>Roméo et Juliette</i> might also respond to the
  physical gestures that so inspired him in 1827, not only in the sonic
  imitations of events from the play, but also in the gestures of the players
  and conductor visible on the stage. Approaches to musical gesture and
  embodiment have largely focused on the individual body (LeGuin, 2005), or on
  the sonic rather than visual impact of gesture (Smart, 2004). Extending these
  approaches, I propose that the sight of the orchestral ensemble, and the
  relationship between conductor and players, may form an integral part of the
  dramatic experience. Drawing on nineteenth-century theories of gesture that
  posit a direct correlation between emotion and the body, as well as
  iconographic evidence of the 1827 performance, I identify a number of moments
  of gestural significance. An examination of rehearsals and performance of two
  movements of Berlioz’s work illustrates how some of these gestural parameters
  may have been scripted into his music. In taking literally Berlioz’s
  suggestion that, in the “genre instrumental expressif,” a “new world is opened
  up to view,” I thus not only offer a new reading of Berlioz’s “dramatic
  symphony,” but also point to ways of extending embodied approaches to
  music.</p>
