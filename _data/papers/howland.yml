  <p>This paper explores late-1960s and early-1970s orchestral soul idioms that
  emerged in parallel with the expansion of the African American middle class.
  In this period, in both US and UK press, the term “progressive” was attached
  to a number of idioms beyond emergent progressive rock. The idea of
  “progressive soul” emerged in the wake of Isaac Hayes’s 1969 album, <i>Hot
  Buttered Soul</i>. In 1969, Billboard describes a newly adventurous
  “progressive” idiom that involves mergings of soul with large ensembles, jazz
  elements, and lush productions and extended arrangements. With the music of
  Hayes, late 1960s “psychedelic soul,” and early 1970s luxuriantly arranged
  releases by Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield, among others, such hybrid soul
  recordings were sometimes described as African American counterparts to
  late-1960s studio innovation trends in rock music. That said, by circa
  1973–74, with the newly arrived chart dominance—and sweeter, more homogeneous
  idioms—of the luxuriant sounds of Philadelphia soul and Barry White (with each
  being seen as having evolved from Hayes), critics either praised the arrival
  of “sophisticated soul” (dubbed “sophistisoul ” in the UK), or denigrated this
  sound as “black Muzak.” This latter, black-middle class luxe pop had
  tremendous success in discotheques, thereby forming one key model for
  disco-era record production. This paper explores class and race discourse,
  genre, hybridization, and recording industry questions around these emergent
  idioms of progressive soul and sophistisoul. Particular attention is given to
  albums by others Barry White and Isaac Hayes, the latter of which topped both
  Billboard’s soul and jazz charts of the era. This curious fact locates both
  luxe and progressive soul at the center of this period’s tendencies toward
  increasingly blurred genre boundaries between popular music and jazz. As with
  Hayes, many of these lushly enhanced soul and funk recordings were designed
  both for the adult-focused LP medium and for the dance floor, each context of
  which favored extended tracks, thereby encouraging innovations in both
  production and arranging. In sum, this research articulates an array of
  culture and class meanings that emerge around the extended, lavish soul
  productions that led to the emergence of the disco era. </p>
