abstract: |
  <p>In several troubadour <i>tornadas</i>, the poet turns to his song and
  addresses it directly, often sending it as both message and messenger to his
  beloved or patron. In doing so, the troubadour grants the song powers of
  speech, motion, and agency, thereby allowing it a subjectivity of its own, and
  employing a phenomenon that I term “personified song.” When these songs are
  performed—an action that inherently involves an interaction with bodies (those
  of performer and audience)—the performer’s singing voice facilitates the
  creation of a third type of body (that of the song) from both poetic
  injunction and the performer’s breath. </p>
  <p>This paper focuses on songs whose <i>tornadas</i> encourage their
  recipients to learn them, initiating a highly physical process that involves
  repeated listenings and restatements until the song is memorized. The act of
  learning thus becomes one of consumption and reproduction, as the recipient
  takes the song into his/her ear and mouth, and simultaneously reproduces it
  with his/her voice. </p>
  <p>I examine these songs through the lenses of medieval pedagogies of singing
  and philosophical discussions of sound, demonstrating that the elements of
  embodiment and physicality inherent in performance construe the act of
  learning as represented in troubadour lyric as a sexual act. Scholarship by
  Boynton, Cochelin, Carruthers, and Busse Berger details the importance of the
  body and physicality in medieval pedagogies of reading and singing, as song
  was internalized and embodied through repeated listening and restatement.
  Additionally, philosophers such as Aristotle, Avicenna, and Isidore of Seville
  conceived of sound and hearing as the most immaterial of the senses, which
  could only be heard when the air lodged inside the ear was struck, and thus
  permeated bodily boundaries. I argue that the process of learning instigates a
  material connection only made possible through the voice on multiple levels:
  between performer and audience, and troubadour and intended recipient. </p>
