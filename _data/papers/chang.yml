abstract: |
  <p>North American missionaries were some of the most effective agents of
  musical change in East Asia in the region’s transition into modern “world
  history.” Interpretations influenced by postcolonial theory have tended to
  view musical circulation via missionary routes as a one-way flow of power, yet
  a closer examination reveals dynamics of complex cultural negotiation as well
  as multidirectional relationships. Although strongly shaped by their own
  ideologies of music, modernity, and subjectivity, missionaries did not remain
  unaffected by their increasing familiarity of local knowledge. Furthermore,
  with the rise of Japan as both a regional empire and a center of Asian
  modernity in the late nineteenth century, they became intertwined with
  multiple shifting power relations across East and Southeast Asia. </p>
  <p>This presentation explores the contestation of the US and Japan that was
  waged through the medium of published songbooks in 1910s Korea, when Korea
  became both the destination of the largest number of American missionaries in
  Asia and a colony of Japan. It focuses on Chyanggajip (A Book of Songs, 1915),
  a collection of secular and religious songs by Annie L. Baird (1864–1916). An
  Indiana-born missionary who was admired for her linguistic expertise in Korean
  language, Baird spearheaded an educational program to be used in Sunday
  schools, mission schools, and churches in Pyongyang, the pre-division center
  of Korean Protestantism. These mission-led institutions, in turn, functioned
  as a site of diffuse resistance for many Koreans who were experiencing
  Japanese linguistic and military campaigns on Korean territory. For this
  Korean audience, Chyanggajip provided a model for a new musical vernacular by
  fusing Euro-American vocal music, Korean vernacular script, and folk-inspired
  pictorial depictions of Korean social cohesion. Through a topical and
  stylistic analysis of Chyanggajip, I demonstrate the workings of missionary
  discipline and cultural negotiation. I also place Chyanggajip in the context
  of Japan’s colonial cultural policy in the Korean colony, which encompassed
  censorship of Korean-language materials, publication of official songbooks,
  and regulation of US missionary activities. I argue that Chyanggajip, a
  patently Korean-nationalistic material authored by an American national,
  reinforced the contest between the Japanese authorities and the US
  missionaries over cultural authority in Korea. </p>
