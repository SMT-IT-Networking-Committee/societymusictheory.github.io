    <p>This paper illuminates various creative formal and phrase-rhythmic strategies devised by Clara Schumann that demonstrate her refined approach to phrase construction and text-setting. Though some scholars have noted a certain “squareness” that pervades Schumann’s music, I argue that this regularity often conceals deeper levels of complexity. In three analytical vignettes, and building on recent studies applying Caplinian form-functions to vocal music (e.g. Krebs 2015; Rodgers 2017; Schmalfeldt 2011), I demonstrate how Schumann overlays formal deviations, intricate textural patterns, and colorful harmonic twists in order to complicate the apparently uniform surfaces. “Der Mond kommt still gegangen” and “Die gute Nacht,” for instance, illustrate how Schumann blurs phrase and hypermetrical boundaries and problematizes form-functional determinations; while in “Beim Abschied,” the composer cleverly hides voice-leading symmetries and shifts harmonic focal points away from their expected placements. Finally, I discuss how these phrase-functional techniques compound the explicit meanings of the song-texts. Schumann’s apparently “square” structures, in sum, often act as revolving doors into original and powerfully expressive formal designs.</p>
