        <p>Julie Pedneault-Deslauriers is Associate Professor of music theory at the University of Ottawa. Her research focuses on issues of musical form, the music of Clara Schumann, and the music of the Second Viennese School composers. It often combines music analysis and aspects of identity and culture, and investigates relationships between poetry, literature, and music.</p>
        <p>Pedneault-Deslauriers is currently serving as Associate Editor for <em>Music Theory Spectrum</em>. Her work has appeared in numerous music theory and musicology journals, including <em>Music Theory Spectrum</em>, the <em>Journal of the American Musicological Society</em>, <em>Music Theory Online</em>, and the <em>Journal of Musicology</em>. She has also co-edited the volume Formal Functions in Perspective: Essays on Musical Form from Haydn to Adorno (with Steven Vande Moortele and Nathan John Martin). </p>
        <p>Her work on Clara Schumann is supported by an ‘Insight' grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; she currently working on a monograph on Schumann’s compositional techniques.</p>
        <p>Pedneault-Deslauriers is keen to engage in public outreach activities. She has given numerous pre-concert talks for the Ottawa Chamberfest, the National Arts Center Orchestra, and the Ottawa Symphony. She is currently working as an artistic advisor with the National Arts Centre Orchestra on a 4-cd project on the music of Brahms and the Schumanns.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>This paper illuminates various creative formal and phrase-rhythmic strategies devised by Clara Schumann that demonstrate her refined approach to phrase construction and text-setting. Though some scholars have noted a certain “squareness” that pervades Schumann’s music, I argue that this regularity often conceals deeper levels of complexity. In three analytical vignettes, and building on recent studies applying Caplinian form-functions to vocal music (e.g. Krebs 2015; Rodgers 2017; Schmalfeldt 2011), I demonstrate how Schumann overlays formal deviations, intricate textural patterns, and colorful harmonic twists in order to complicate the apparently uniform surfaces. “Der Mond kommt still gegangen” and “Die gute Nacht,” for instance, illustrate how Schumann blurs phrase and hypermetrical boundaries and problematizes form-functional determinations; while in “Beim Abschied,” the composer cleverly hides voice-leading symmetries and shifts harmonic focal points away from their expected placements. Finally, I discuss how these phrase-functional techniques compound the explicit meanings of the song-texts. Schumann’s apparently “square” structures, in sum, often act as revolving doors into original and powerfully expressive formal designs.</p>
