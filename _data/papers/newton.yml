  <p>On the surface, form in bluegrass bears similarities to classical form:
  many main themes are based around sentence and period structures that
  combine to create binary forms. However, within the overall form of a
  performance of a bluegrass piece, there can be a marked contrast between the
  main theme, which is often non-instrument-specific, and the improvised
  sections that, while often referencing the main theme, are distinctly
  colored by the instrument used to play them. The degree to which the
  instrument can influence the motivic material in improvised passages is
  beyond idiomaticism—where phrases might suit one instrument more than
  another—to the point where melodic pitch-collections are shaped by the
  instrument architecture.</p>
  <p>By combining post-human philosophies with music theories that emphasize
  instrument/player relationships, I will show how non-humans exercise agency in
  bluegrass improvisation. The resultant instrument-influenced passages, when
  heard alongside non instrument-specific sections, can help to signify formal
  structure within a performance. The recurrence of particular
  instrument-influenced elements can be seen as a genre marker in bluegrass. The
  discussion surrounding gifts and commodities can inform how this relationship
  between instruments and musicians is central to bluegrass musical
  tradition.</p>
