abstract: |
  <p>This paper focuses on Schubert’s settings of poems by Wilhelm Müller that
  invoke media on which literary communication depends, such as the graffito,
  the letter, and the postal service. Beyond these vehicles for the written
  word, the functions of inscription, transmission, and storage are also
  fulfilled by natural phenomena deemed capable of relaying messages, such as
  wind, water, and wildlife.</p>
  <p>By foregrounding the material conditions under which communication becomes
  conceivable, these songs rehearse a “discourse on discourse channel
  conditions,” in media theorist Friedrich Kittler’s formulation. For Kittler,
  Romantic poetry filtered the “noise” [<i>Rauschen</i>] of nature into a
  spiritual signal to be registered and decoded by the hermeneutic efforts of
  the mind. When conjoined with music to be performed as lieder, however, the
  expressive wherewithal of poetry was transformed. Through the “round[ing] of
  sound into [tones],” as Goethe put it, poetry could draw on the musical
  attributes of tonality and timbre and the shared resources of meter and rhythm
  as well as its own alphabetical logic and sublexical plenitude. As Müller
  himself put it, “my songs lead but half a life, a paper existence of black and
  white, until music breathes life into them.” The coming together of elemental
  and technological media that transmit the written word in both
  <i>Winterreise</i> and <i>Die schöne Müllerin</i> can thus be mapped onto
  Schubert’s distinctive blending of voice and keyboard, melody and harmony,
  note and letter, sound and meaning.</p>
  <p>For Schubert, however, “there is no one who understands the sorrow or the
  joy of others! We always imagine we are coming together, and we always merely
  go side by side.” Within the diegetic frames and polarized gender dynamics of
  both Müller cycles, communication is doomed to failure: instead of being
  delivered to (female) others, messages are returned to their (male) senders,
  creating positive feedback loops that amplify loss, longing, regret, and
  alienation. Beyond that, the social milieu from which these songs emerged show
  the lied itself to be a transmissive technology that recursively exemplified
  the (im)possibility of communication within and against the repression of
  Vienna’s sociopolitical regime.</p>
