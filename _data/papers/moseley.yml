    <p>Thomas Adès often suffuses his music with transformations of music past
    and present. His penchant for producing discombobulated representations of
    other music—as in the macabre cancan of <i>Lieux retrouvés</i>; the warped
    “Dies irae” in <i>Totentanz</i>; or the distorted rave of “Ecstasio”—has
    caused numerous critics to remark on the music’s surrealist qualities
    (Taruskin 2009; Fox 2004; Massey 2012, Service 2012; Cooper 2017; Venn
    2017). These re-makings of specific works, styles, and genres are matched
    by similar transformations of generic and familiar sounds and patterns,
    like the discombobulating (016) that follows the tonic and dominant chords
    that begin the Piano Quintet (Stoecker 2014). Common to each mode of
    allusion is the underlying presence of defamiliarization. Adès’s music
    constantly renders familiar sounds strange, uncanny, and, on occasion,
    bizarre. Drawing primarily from his four recent mazurkas, this paper
    explores techniques that Adès uses to meld abstract patterns to generic
    tonal objects like triads and scales, and it situates these techniques
    alongside two axioms of surrealist art and music from the 1920s and ’30s,
    defamiliarization and automatism. I show how these fusions fundamentally
    transform his mazurkas by creating local, large-scale, and structural
    distortions of familiar musical processes and methods of organization.</p>
