    <p>The parallel tonal and narrative trajectories of Amy Beach’s “Autumn Song” (1904) culminate in a single moment: a wordless melisma that happens at the midpoint of an <em>octatonic-triadic</em> <em>cycle</em>. So named in order to distinguish it from the octatonic system of seventh chords, the octatonic-triadic cycle alternates R and P transformations, producing a cycle of eight triads drawn from one of the three forms of the octatonic scale. R/P cycles bear many similarities to the more prominent hexatonic (P/L) cycle, although because of their length they are often left incomplete. The greater voice-leading “work” required by R (which moves a single voice by whole step rather than half step) creates a voice-leading asymmetry by which clockwise and counter-clockwise movements through an odd number of stations involve different semitonal displacements. Each chord in the cycle thus has both an octatonic pole and two octatonic <em>near poles</em>, with which it shares no pitches. These near poles are separated by a different number of half-steps, and even different root intervals.</p>
    <p>This paper argues that “Autumn Song” hinges on this textless moment of tonal instability: the pivotal moment’s enharmonic reinterpretation positions the song’s ordinarily proximate tonics (the initial minor and closing parallel major) on opposite sides of a tonally distant octatonic near pole. Beach problematizes the relationship between parsimonious voice leading and diatonic tonality, depicting musically—between verses of the poem—the psychological interiority of the protagonist, who emerges from the song’s rotational formal and harmonic processes with a changed outlook.</p>
