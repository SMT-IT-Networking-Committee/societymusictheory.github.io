abstract: |
  <p>Modern scholars Walters Robertson, Wright, Macey, and others have identified
  copious examples of symbolism in Renaissance sacred music, yet treatises on
  <i>musica practica</i> and <i>speculativa</i> remain conspicuously silent about
  rhetorical and symbolic devices in masses and motets. The effect of such
  theoretical silence is nowhere more resounding than in the masses of Johannes
  Ockeghem. Studies by Fitch, Duffin, Rodin, and Luko focus largely on the
  technical aspects of counterpoint in Ockeghem’s “aesthetic of concealment.”
  </p>
  <p>This paper argues that <i>Missa Quinti toni</i> and <i>Missa Prolationum</i>
  contain symbolism whose inspiration will be found not in music treatises, but
  in the public writings of Nicholas of Cusa and his contemporaries. In
  particular, these masses reveal devices that correspond with remarkable
  consistency to the symbolic theologies in Cusa’s treatises and public
  sermons.</p>
  <p><i>Missa Quinti toni</i> proceeds from an apparent chaos of concealed
  motivic logic (Fitch and Luko), through a plethora of invertible motifs
  identified by this author, culminating in the first known use of the six
  <i>voces musicales</i> in incremental form, an explicit <i>scala caelestis</i>,
  mirroring one of the main theses of Cusa’s <i>De quaerendo Deum</i>, that
  searching for the Lord is like climbing a ladder through the senses heavenward.
  The expanding canon of <i>Missa Prolationum</i> corresponds closely to
  theological-geometrical concepts in Cusa’s treatise <i>De docta ignorantia</i>,
  that proves the existence of God through endless expanding geometrical arcs.
  Most significantly, Cusa argues in <i>De quaerendo Deum </i>that one must
  search for the Lord by contemplating the Greek name <i>Theos</i> (θεός). Cusa’s
  foundational concept appears hidden in plain sight in Ockeghem’s <i>Missa
  Prolationim</i>: the four fundamental musical mensuration signs at the heart of
  its canon correspond precisely to the four Greek letters letters of the name of
  the Lord, imagery echoed in Johann Theodor de Bry’s engraving of Hermes
  Trismegistus, pointing heavenward towards an image that simultaneously
  represents the four mensuration signs and <i>Theos</i>. Contemporary theology
  and imagery reveals that this is no coincidence. Ockeghem’s masses thus play a
  central role in documentable traditions of symbolizing divinity as a musical
  ladder and depicting the name of the Lord in music and visual imagery. </p>
