abstract: |
    <p>Sometime in the first two decades of the 16th century, an anonymous
    German musician copied a little counterpoint treatise onto paper. <i>Juxta
    artem conficiendi</i> stands out for four examples of three-voice
    counterpoint preserved not on staff lines, but notated entirely
    in <i>solmization</i> syllables. These passages reveal the extent to which
    a teacher and student could communicate and preserve entire polyphonic
    constructs in terms of solmization, and they provide valuable information
    beyond the pitches of the voices. They reveal the musical tone of each
    passage, give a detailed account of the possible musical range for each
    example within the musical hand. In one example, all three voices outline
    the three proprieties (soft, medium, and hard), reflecting contemporary
    notation in two or three different key signatures.</p>

    <p>These examples provide insight into the performance of contemporary
    works, including Ockeghem’s <i>Missa Quinti toni, </i>whose head motifs
    would be sung with in identical solmization to the most extensive example
    in <i>Juxta artem conficiendi</i>. Applying this type of solmization
    to <i>Missa Quinti toni</i> further reveals hidden passages of imitation
    and palindromic play. Applying the same principles in performance of dance
    music ca. 1500 offers a richer understanding on the development,
    performance, and perception of the early <i>passamezzo</i> dance patterns.
    Using solmization to understand the melodic vocabulary of polyphonic music
    offers more nuanced and precise methods for communicating melodic
    patterns. The implications for the modern performance of composed and
    improvised polyphony are profound.</p>
