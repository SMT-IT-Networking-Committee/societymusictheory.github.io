title: "Stygian Spirits: The Metaphor of Hell in Eighteenth-Century Mad Scenes"

abstract: |
  <p>In the famous mad scene at the heart of Handel’s 1733 <i>Orlando,</i> the
  titular knight imagines that he has died and gone to Hell. Orlando describes
  crossing the Styx in Charon’s boat, encountering the infernal guard-dog
  Cerberus, and seeing a vision of his beloved Angelica—whom he identifies as
  Proserpina—in the arms of her lover Medoro. Handel’s <i>Orlando</i> belongs to
  a robust tradition of mad scenes that dates back into the seventeenth century
  in which characters hallucinate being in Hell, as evidenced by works such as
  Giovanni Legrenzi’s <i>Totila</i> (1677). Around the turn of the eighteenth
  century, however, the infernal delusion became far more prominent as a way to
  show madness on stage. Hell was also used in simile arias to represent the
  singer’s disordered emotional state. At the same time, due to a combination of
  Arcadian opera reforms, Enlightenment aesthetics, and a general decline in
  belief in Hell, operatic representations of Hell fell out of favor. The
  metaphorical Hell of the disordered mind replaced the literal damned soul on
  the operatic stage.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I will show how Italian opera composers of the early
  eighteenth century adopted seventeenth-century musical markers of
  Hell—developed to create the sonic atmosphere of a place—and adapted them to
  representation of a state of mind. Some of these techniques, such as tremolo
  strings, were borrowed from French orchestral writing. Others, such as poetic
  meters with <i>sdrucciolo</i> line-endings (with the stress on the
  antepenultimate syllable) were native to Italian opera. These techniques
  evolved so that, when literal hell scenes began to come back into fashion later
  in the 1700s, some had been transformed so that they were no longer
  recognizable. Considering scenes in later eighteenth-century operas such as
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> where the Underworld is invoked, I will show the hitherto
  unrecognized debt that Mozart and his colleagues owed to seventeenth-century
  Hell scenes. </p>
