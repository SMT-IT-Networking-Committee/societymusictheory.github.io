abstract: |
  <p>In his 1988 article “Music as Drama,” Fred Everett Maus argued that the
  indeterminacy of musical agency—the elusive identity of who acts in musical
  experience—is a fundamental quality of music-analytic language. Taking this
  indeterminacy as a challenge, responses to Maus often posit hierarchical
  taxonomies, in which the higher status of human agents is continually assumed
  over that of nonhuman musical agents. However, by treating the ambiguity of
  musical agency as a problem to be solved with anthropocentric solutions,
  scholars have yet to consider the posthuman potential in music’s agential
  indeterminacy. </p>
  <p>With the recent “posthuman turn” across many academic disciplines, my paper
  presents an alternative line of inquiry by connecting Maus’s indeterminate
  version of musical agency with his subsequent writings on music’s erotic
  animism. From musical animism, I then incorporate the concept of animacy
  developed by queer theorist Mel Y. Chen. Resisting the human-centric hierarchy
  of animacy in linguistics, Chen points to instances when language subverts the
  agential status quo as opportunities to rethink who or what matters for
  biopolitical and ethical ends. Thinking with Chen, I suggest that while one
  can respond to “Music as Drama” by reinforcing anthropocentric agential
  hierarchies, reading this essay alongside Maus’s feminist and queer
  scholarship on music’s animism leads to another possibility. By taking music’s
  animacy in our disciplinary turns of phrase seriously, I argue that we can
  reorient our discipline’s concerns to account for diverse kinds of subjects,
  identities, and experiences.</p>
