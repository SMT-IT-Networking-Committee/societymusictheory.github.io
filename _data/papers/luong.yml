    <p>This paper contemplates the lines that animate our work—from music-analytical systems that shape sound into knowledge to the disciplinary divisions that distinguish us. To begin, I theorize these lines with Karen Barad’s concept of agential cuts. For Barad, making agential cuts at once produces knowledge (epistemology), constitutes its objects (ontology), and fosters particular attitudes toward them (ethics)—which she expresses with the term “ethico-onto-epistem-ology.” Bringing this perspective to music theory, I frame analysis as not only a form of knowing, but also of relating and world-making.</p>
    <p>The second half of my paper turns to affective autoethnography in order to account for these latent aspects of analysis. Here, I draw on the collaborative work of Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart to define affective autoethnography as self-reflexive writing on experience, feeling, and space. With their writings as models, I offer five vignettes on the worlds that formed around my Schenkerian analysis of J. S. Bach’s Prelude in B-flat minor, BWV 891. These examples depict analysis as a practice shaped by both good and bad agential cuts across a network of bodies.</p>
    <p>To conclude, I place my vignettes in dialogue with past feminist and queer interventions in opening our field to diverse identities and perspectives. Through sharing my experiment with autoethnography, this paper asks us to reimagine how to we can write about our acquired disciplinary habits and their effects. In doing so, I hope that we can work toward redrawing lines to construct better worlds.</p>
