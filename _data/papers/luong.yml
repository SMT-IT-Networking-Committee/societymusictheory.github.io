abstract: |
    <p>Bodies—listeners’ bodies, performers’ bodies, sonic/musical bodies—have
    become key music-theoretical objects of study in recent decades. Following
    Suzanne Cusick’s feminist critique of music theory’s mind/body problem
    (1994), accounts of embodied musical experience now proliferate across
    music-theoretical scholarship from performance and analysis to music
    cognition as well as music and disability studies. While Cusick’s and other
    feminist music-theoretical texts are often referenced in this literature,
    music theorists have yet to consider the feminist-philosophical context out
    of which these influential writings on the body emerged.</p>

    <p>My paper illuminates the philosophical orientations that color one such
    text, McClary’s <i>Feminine Endings</i>. While a significant contribution to new
    musicology, I argue that McClary’s text also opened a space for bodily inquiry
    in music theory. Drawing on Elizabeth Grosz’s history of feminist approaches to
    the body, I contextualize <i>Feminine Endings</i> in relation to three
    categories of feminist thought: egalitarian feminism, social constructionism,
    and sexual difference. In contrast to McClary’s critics who understand her work
    as an imprecise borrowing of <i>écriture féminine</i>, I demonstrate how
    observed inconsistencies in McClary’s project arise out of two factors: 1) a
    tension between her investments in egalitarian feminism and social
    constructionism; and 2) the historical moment in which <i>Feminine Endings
    </i>emerged as theories of sexual difference by Grosz, Judith Butler, and Donna
    Haraway were taking hold. By situating <i>Feminine Endings</i> as a key
    music-theoretical text, this paper calls for (re)writing the history of music
    theory’s embodied turn to adequately acknowledge its debt to early feminist
    music scholarship.</p>
