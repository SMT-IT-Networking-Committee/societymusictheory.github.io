abstract: |
  <lpp>Duke Ellington’s <i>Daybreak Express</i> (1933) draws much of its musical
  material from the sounds of train motion, and for this reason can be considered
  alongside other train-inspired works of the twentieth century such as Arthur
  Honegger’s <i>Pacific 231</i>(1923) or Steve Reich’s <i>Different Trains</i>
  (1988). However, unlike these other pieces, Ellington’s orchestrates not only
  the sounds of train motion but also the psychoacoustic processes involved in
  the perception of those sounds. His music depicts Doppler shift, object
  streaming, and inattention deafness as they impinge upon an embodied subject’s
  perception of a train accelerating to a steady speed, maintaining that speed
  for some time, and finally slowing down to a halt. In the first portion of this
  paper, I demonstrate the musical means by which the piece’s introduction
  depicts each of these processes, drawing from Albert Bregman’s work on auditory
  scene analysis and Ken Rattenbury’s investigation of Ellington’s compositional
  methodology. I then show how the structural aesthetics of these processes are
  used to articulate more abstract musical ideas in later sections of the
  piece.</p>
  <p>The second portion of this paper examines some of the philosophical and
  historiographical issues arising from my analysis. I describe the ways in which
  <i>Daybreak Express</i> presages by almost forty years some of the aesthetic
  attitudes and compositional techniques of spectral music, traditionally
  understood as beginning with French and German composers in the 1970s. I
  compare Ellington’s music to that of Gérard Grisey in order to point up the
  similar approaches each of these musicians took when transducing the
  phenomenology of sound into musical performance. By positioning Ellington
  alongside other experimental composers of the twentieth century, I argue for
  thinking bidirectionally in time about <i>Daybreak Express</i>, as it
  participates in and complicates musical discourses that both preceded and
  succeeded its date of composition.</p>
