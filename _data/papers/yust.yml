abstract: |
    <p>Much of Steve Reich's music of the 1970s and â€™80s is based on
    cyclically-repeated rhythms in canon. This paper introduces a theory of
    rhythmic qualities, analogous to Ian Quinn's theory of harmonic qualities,
    to address questions about meter in these rhythms and to show the special
    significance of maximally even patterns to constructing them. Maximally
    even patterns play an important role in the theory of rhythmic qualities
    as prototypes. For instance, the "diatonic" rhythm that Reich uses in the
    last movement of his Sextet maximizes the fifth Fourier quality (f5).
    Because the total set of qualities represents a lossless transformation of
    the rhythm, this presence of f5 allows for the suppression of other
    qualities, which relate to conventional concepts of meter.</p>
    <p>The rhythm that Reich uses most frequently, the <i>Clapping Music</i>
    rhythm, also has a prominent f5, but is not maximally even. Reich adds an
    additional onset so that this rhythm can also project f3 and f4 qualities,
    which relate to 3/2 and 12/8 meters. By manipulating canonic delays, then,
    Reich can create a sense of shifting meter. This idea of using rhythms that
    project not a single quality (simple maximally even rhythms) but combine
    features of two or three, is a common strategy, as can be seen in some
    interior movements where Reich uses cycles of irregular meters. The fourth
    movement of the Sextet, for instance, is based on a rhythm that combines
    ME(7,22) and ME(9,22) patterns and has a similar spectrum to the <i>Clapping
    Music</i> rhythm.</p>
