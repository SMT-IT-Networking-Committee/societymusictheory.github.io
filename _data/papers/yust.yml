    <p>Some recent work on generalized <i>Tonnetze </i>has examined the
    topologies resulting from Richard Cohn’s common-tone based formulation,
    while other work has reformulated the <i>Tonnetz</i> as a network of
    voice-leading relationships and investigated the resulting geometries.
    This paper considers the original common-tone based formulation and takes
    a geometrical approach, showing that <i>Tonnetze</i> can always be
    realized in toroidal spaces, and that the resulting spaces always
    correspond to one of the possible Fourier phase spaces. We can optimize
    the given <i>Tonnetz</i> to the space (or vice-versa) using the DFT. Short
    analytical examples from Stravinsky’s “Owl and the Pussycat” and
    Shostakovich’s String Quartet no. 12 demonstrate how the embedding in
    phase spaces broadens the potential application on non-triadic trichordal
    <i>Tonnetze</i>.</p>

    <p>Two-dimensional <i>Tonnetze</i> may be understood as simplicial
    decompositions of the 2-torus into regions associated with the
    representatives of a single Forte set class, making simplicial
    decompositions of the 3-torus a natural generalization to tetrachords.
    This means that a three-dimensional <i>Tonnetz</i> is a network of
    <i>three</i> tetrachord-types related by shared trichordal subsets.
    Essential to constructing the three-dimensional <i>Tonnetze</i> is the
    duplication of interval classes with distinguishable intervallic axes. I
    illustrate one possible three-dimensional <i>Tonnetz</i>, whose duplicated
    ic3s can be enharmonically distinguished as minor thirds or augmented
    seconds, in an analysis of Brahms’ Sarabande WoO 5/1 and its reuse in the
    Op. 88 Quintet. Duplicated intervals in other three-dimensional
    <i>Tonnetze</i> may be understood through Hauptmannian or tuning-theory
    based distinctions or distinctions between chordal and non-chordal
    intervals.</p>
