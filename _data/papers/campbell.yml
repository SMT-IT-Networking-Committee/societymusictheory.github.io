title: "The Talk of a Madman? Claudio Monteverdi’s Modulations"

abstract: |
  <p>Claudio Monteverdi’s “Nisi Dominus” (<i>Vespro della Beata Vergine</i>,
  1610) concludes with a shocking move from a three-flat system at the beginning
  of the doxology to a one-flat system at the end. You can almost hear Giovanni
  Artusi shouting, “this is the talk of a madman!” (Strunk, 1998). My paper
  identifies the method to Monteverdi’s madness: modulation. Unlike our modern
  understanding of modulation, Monteverdi’s technique exploited the unique
  relationship between system (<i>cantus durus</i> and <i>cantus mollis</i>),
  psalm tone, and transposition. Monteverdi harnessed this relationship in “Nisi
  Dominus” to interpret the overall structure and meaning of the psalm text as a
  musical form. </p>
  <p>Beginning with system, psalm tone, and transposition, I detail a theory of
  modulation for early seventeenth-century music based on the organ treatises of
  Adriano Banchieri (1568–1634) and Girolamo Diruta (ca. 1554–1610). I then
  apply this theory to an analysis of Monteverdi’s “Nisi Dominus,” describing
  the form as a series of three flatward modulations reflecting Monteverdi’s
  interpretation of the psalm text. Monteverdi complemented this flatward
  descent with a fantastic textural effect, dividing the choirs at the beginning
  of the piece and gradually merging them to reunite at the doxology. Far from
  the talk of a madman, Monteverdi’s inventive use of modulation speaks to his
  craft as a masterful—and very sane—composer. </p>
