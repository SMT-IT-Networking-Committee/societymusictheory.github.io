    <p>Few scholars have remarked on the relationship between counterpoint and meantone temperament in the early Baroque, yet this relationship explains seemingly anomalous features in contrapuntal writing from this time. These features affect stretto fugae (Milsom 2005), sequences (Harrison 2003), and contrapuntal modules (Owens 1984; Schubert 2007). Adriano Banchieri describes a “rule of strict counterpoint” (hereafter, RSC) in his <em>Cartella musicale</em> (1614) that accounts for the relationship between counterpoint and meantone temperament. I apply his rule to examples from Chiara Margarita Cozzolani and Claudio Monteverdi to show how apparently anomalous features result from meantone limitations.</p>
    <p>First, I illustrate how Cozzolani begins and ends sequences in specific locations in her psalm setting, “Dixit Dominus a8” (<em>Salmi a otto voci concertati</em>, op. 3, 1650), that correlate with the limits described by Banchieri’s RSC. Next, I analyze a different passage from Cozzolani’s piece, as well as a passage from Monteverdi’s “Dixit Dominus Secondo” (<em>Selva morale e spirituale</em>, 1641), to show how contrapuntal modules (repeated multi-voice units of counterpoint) are transposed to only those locations that avoid violating Banchieri’s RSC. Finally, I examine a passage from Monteverdi’s “Dixit Dominus Primo” (<em>Selva morale</em>) to show how Banchieri’s RSC accounts for Monteverdi’s selection of accidentals and specific contrapuntal adjustments in his stretto fuga.</p>
    <p>Reconceptualizing counterpoint in relation to temperament highlights a previously overlooked dimension of early Baroque composition. Banchieri’s RSC provides analysts with a simple tool to examine this dimension while complimenting work done by other scholars, including the contrapuntal techniques discussed in this presentation.</p>
