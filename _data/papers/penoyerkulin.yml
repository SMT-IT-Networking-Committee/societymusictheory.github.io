  <p>Elizabeth Kramer (2005, 2006) and Friedhelm Krummacher (1979) have drawn
  attention to the fact that during the first three decades of the nineteenth
  century, a new conception of sacred music emerged in Germany. Where previously
  it had been defined in terms of its function as an accompaniment to religious
  rites, for the latest generation of German thinkers like E.T.A. Hoffmann and
  Gottfried Weber, sacred music became seen as something whose spirituality was
  embedded within the contents of the music itself. With this change in attitude
  came a change in nomenclature, and the old labels of “sacred” or “church”
  music were replaced with the more appropriate-sounding “religious music.” The
  discourse that developed around religious music in the 1800s-1830s emphasized
  masculinist ideals of composition and the primacy of “transfiguration,” an
  idea which implied that when writing a piece of religious music, the composer
  was “transfigured” by contact with the divine, and that the performance of the
  work would likewise transfigure the audience. In my presentation, I argue that
  this notion of religious music played a fundamental role in differentiating
  the German from the non-German reaction to a key sacred work of the 1840s: the
  Rossini <i>Stabat Mater.</i> The German response was represented in two
  reviews by Richard Wagner and Heinrich Heine, both of which partook heavily in
  the language and assumptions of religious music discourse. In the articles by
  French and Italian reviewers however, this paradigm was noticeably absent. As
  Lucia Marchi has pointed out (2011), they instead promoted a secular
  aesthetics of sacred composition, where music written for religious texts was
  not required to pursue any kind of religious style or purpose beyond sounding
  pleasant. My presentation therefore seeks not only to show how the idea of
  religious music continued to propagate in Germany beyond the 1830s, but also
  to illustrate how little its influence was felt in the rest of Europe at that
  time, an absence that would contribute significantly to nationalist assertions
  of Germany’s musical superiority over its less serious and supposedly less
  spiritual national counterparts.</p>
