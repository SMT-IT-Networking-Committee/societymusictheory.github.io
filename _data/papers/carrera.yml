title: "“Are You There?”: Mourning and Absent Presence in an AIDS-era Answering Machine Message Archive"

abstract: |
  <p>The answering machine, responsible for producing the most voice
  recordings in the twentieth century, yields sound objects that engage presence
  and absence in ways unexplored by recent sound studies scholarship on these
  themes. In the 1980s, the new technology was theorized as an encounter with
  “absent presence”: the answering machine acts as a placeholder for another
  person, implying their future presence while relaying their immediate absence,
  and records the caller’s reaction to their failed attempt at connection.
  Building on my previous work on this encounter’s affordances for
  message-leavers and receivers, I turn here to consider the personal answering
  machine tape as a sound archive requiring a different form of listening. How
  should one approach the analysis and interpretation of such an archive’s
  recordings in relation to each other, their medium, and their context?</p>
  <p>In this paper, I explore this question through a message archive produced
  in a context that heightened the personal and political significance of
  presence and absence. During the first-wave AIDS crisis (1981–96), answering
  machines were ubiquitous. In the tapes of well-known artist, writer, and
  AIDS activist David Wojnarowicz (1954–92), casual calls intermingle with
  hospital visit plans and death notices. My paper begins with a close
  listening to the sonic patterns that emerge across these messages. Drawing
  from recent scholarship on queer forms of temporality, relationality, and
  affect, I suggest that the voices on tape produce a haunting negative
  portrait of Wojnarowicz that testifies to the nature of precarious life—an
  absent presence created after his death by the sonic contours of his loved
  ones’ efforts to reach him in life. Next, I examine the nature of this
  ghostly portrait, mobilizing literary theorizations of prosopopoeia to
  consider what this portrait enables for a contemporary listener. Drawing
  from reflections on mourning in poststructural and queer theory, I argue
  that summoning this portrait of Wojnarowicz through archival listening
  constitutes a form of melancholic mourning that parallels the act of leaving
  an answering machine message. This mourning enables the queer intermingling
  of subjectivities across time and space, a political and politicizing
  experience that can ultimately challenge the persistent structural
  underpinnings of the AIDS crisis.</p>
