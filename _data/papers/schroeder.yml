abstract: |
  <p>For the past century, debates regarding musico-poetic relationships in the
  earliest Parisian motets have been dominated by the argument that Latin texts
  submit to pre-existing discant clausulae. Over the years scholars have
  employed evidence as diverse as notation, “evolutionary trends,” and analogies
  to sequences to defend this position, but it is the abiding argument of poetic
  irregularity that has established this belief as a veritable dogma of medieval
  music. In his description of the motet <i>Immolata paschali
  victima</i>/<i>Latus</i>, Mark Everist notes that “the text exhibits a wide
  range of line lengths [and] there [does not] appear to be any logical
  relationship between musical phrase length and poetic line length. In short
  there seems to be a lack of interest in what are conventionally considered
  text-music relations.”</p>
  <p>Yet there is evidence to suggest that early motet composers recognized and
  actively cultivated text-music relationships, especially in those motets with
  multiple tenor statements. Research on the late-thirteenth-century motet has
  shown that tenor repetition prompted certain composers to employ melodic
  repetition in upper voices creating a form William Dalglish termed “variation”
  or “isomelic” motets. More recently, Everist himself noted a number of French
  motets from c.1300 whose upper voices mimic the chanson form of their French
  tenors. These principles of melodic and structural repetition also occur in
  many early-thirteenth-century motets, but more significantly tenor repetitions
  in these motets frequently correspond to important textual divisions as well.
  In this paper I demonstrate the close continuity between text and music in
  some of the earliest Latin motets, specifically those whose texts are
  attributed to Philip the Chancellor. Through an exploration of the medieval
  “strophe” as witnessed in contemporary poetry treatises, I show that the
  division of motets by tenor repetition demonstrates a “pseudo-strophic” form
  supported by musical repetitions in the upper voices. Not only does such an
  analysis problematize the textual irregularity and subservience that hitherto
  have defined the medieval motet, it also asks us to consider more deliberately
  the very nature of tenor repetitions, their origins, and their significance in
  the development of the motet.</p>
