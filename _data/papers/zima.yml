title: "“No Profession So Hopeless”:  The Economic and Social Challenges of Composition During the Weimar Republic"

abstract: |
  <p>A columnist writing in the <i>Allgemeine Musikzeitung</i> lamented in 1927
  that no other profession in Germany worked “so cheaply or hopelessly” as
  composers. Indeed, the composer and the profession of composition occupied a
  precarious position in German society during the Weimar Republic. Unfavorable
  publishing and copyright terms, disappearing avenues of patronage, and a lack
  of standardized credentialing processes or conservatory curricula for
  composers all contributed to this rather bleak state of affairs and elicited
  calls for reform by composers and members of the press alike. Using writings
  from contemporary German newspapers and music journals I will examine the
  social and economic status of the composer during the Weimar period, focusing
  especially on attempts at reform in the areas of copyright, education, and
  music criticism. Surprisingly, many of the reforms sought by composers were
  achieved only after the rise of the Third Reich in 1933.</p>
  <p>Though there were exceptions like Richard Strauss, in almost all cases
  German composers had a difficult time gaining financial security from their
  art. The modern image of the Weimar Republic as a golden age for the
  production of art was mostly illusory in the case of art-music composers, and
  the failure on the part of the Weimar government to alleviate the economic
  concerns of composers through the democratic process left many embittered
  against parliamentary politics and open to claims that the newly formed
  Reichsmusikkammer could more efficiently and effectively implement the
  economic and social reforms sought by composers. Examining the profession of
  composition during the Weimar period in this manner serves to complicate and
  nuance our view not only of the Weimar Republic, but also of the early years
  of the Third Reich, allowing for a greater understanding of both. </p>
