  <p>Analytic work on Ravel’s music has unmasked his ability to discretely
  manipulate formal and harmonic expectations, yet, until recently, his
  manipulation of instrumental color—a hallmark of his style—has been largely
  overlooked or considered inconsequential to the interpretation of his works.
  In this presentation, I turn our attention to timbre, a domain central to
  Ravel’s late transcriptions and compositions, to show how the creation of
  illusory instruments contributes to Ravel’s mischievous structures.</p>
  <p>Expanding upon Johnson’s (2011) Standard, Power, and Color model, I
  identify special passages in which an illusory sound is created through the
  manipulation of timbre by technique (i.e., mutes, uncharacteristic registers)
  and/or novel instrumental combinations. <i>Boléro</i>, for instance, uses
  timbre to not only generate interest within the repetitive structure, but to
  also create timbral illusions, such as imitating the sound of a tenor sax
  through the coupling of flutes and trumpet or sonically summoning the calliope
  through the novel combination of high winds, brass, and celeste. More often,
  timbre is used to add extra-musical meaning or to mark the form. In both the
  Concerto in G and the transcription of “Gnomus” from Mussorgsky’s <i>Pictures
  at an Exhibition</i>, Ravel recomposes themes with <i>color</i> instruments
  and techniques in ways that transform natural timbres into instruments that do
  not exist. By looking deeply at Ravel’s use of timbre to create illusion
  within the sound and structure of a piece, we can better understand one of the
  most notable characteristics of his late style.</p>
