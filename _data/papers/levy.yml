abstract: |
    <p>The legacy of John Coltrane rests principally on the recordings of his
    Classic Quartet. But published analyses of these performances focus on
    Coltrane’s individual line, ignoring its relationship to the playing of
    other members of the Quartet. These analyses also tend to privilege
    harmonic and motivic connections that emphasize unity over formal aspects
    that reflect the performative nature of jazz. Looking instead at
    transcriptions of the playing of all members of the Quartet treats the
    music as a whole and reveals multiple layers of interaction.</p>

    <p>Examining full transcriptions of “Miles’ Mode” (<i>Coltrane, </i>1962)
    uncovers layers of harmonic conflict that an analysis of Coltrane’s line
    alone would miss—such as Tyner’s quartal voicings (inflected functionally
    and transposed chromatically) and Coltrane’s progressions based on
    third-relations, both of which conflict with the modal context. Similar
    examination of Elvin Jones’s and McCoy Tyner’s performance in “Pursuance”
    (<i>A Love Supreme, </i>1964), reveals phenomena of the same sort in terms
    of rhythm and meter, illustrating a synthesis of rhythmic and harmonic
    layering. Analysis of both harmonic <i>and </i>rhythmic layers reveals a
    complexity of interaction that an analysis through the lens of functional
    harmony would miss.</p>

    <p>The interactions in “Miles’ Mode” and “Pursuance” exemplify how the
    Quartet creates a rhetoric of tension and release by playing with and
    against prevailing harmonic substructures and rhythmic substructures <i>in
    time</i>. In addition, analysis of the rhythmic and harmonic interactions
    of Coltrane’s predecessors (e.g., Max Roach and Charlie Parker) reveals
    precedents for the innovative sound of the Classic Quartet.</p>
