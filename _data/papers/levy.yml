abstract: |
  <p>Coming to prominence in a post-war compositional scene that emphasized
  progress and innovation, Ligeti and composers who followed his example adopted
  certain strategies for differentiating their work from what they perceived as
  the musical establishment. For example, Eric Drott (“Spectralism, Politics and
  the Post-Industrial Imagination”) has shown how spectral composers’ criticism
  of serialism mixes seemingly objective, technical language describing and
  legitimizing their new compositional aesthetic with more impassioned
  exhortations that recall the language of new social movements that followed
  the European political upheavals of 1968. This paper investigates a similar
  split between quasi-scientific and political objectives in music by Ligeti and
  Vivier by examining their rhetorical strategies for introducing microtones in
  program notes and commentaries as well as their musical use in compositions.
  </p>
  <p>Through recordings, travel, and ethnomusicological studies, Ligeti and
  Vivier were acutely aware of the richness of non-Western musical traditions.
  Vivier evokes these readily in his titles, and Ligeti consistently connects
  his use of “uncorrected” natural harmonics and other microtones to a
  “dissatisfaction” with equal temperament (<i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> vol. 2,
  306) roused by his familiarity with music from Southeast Asia and Africa.
  While much of the rhetoric around microtones is centered on specific tuning
  systems, examples including Vivier’s <i>Bouchara</i> and Ligeti’s
  <i>Ramifications</i> and <i>Hamburg Concerto</i> belie any emphasis on
  mathematical precision. Instead these composers valued the way microtonal
  sonorities blur recognized categories of sound (e.g. consonance and
  dissonance), something which has political resonances in the deconstruction of
  reified societal categories and the assertion of individual difference. </p>
  <p>Ligeti and Vivier both identified as outsiders, and they straddle a
  precarious line between expressing solidarity with marginalized people on the
  one hand, and objectifying them through an orientalist lens on the other. By
  analyzing their extramusical rhetoric alongside the intricacies of their
  microtonal practice, I hope to connect technical discussions of liminal and
  hybrid musical structures (following Gérard Grisey) to broader cultural
  theories (e.g. Edward Said and Homi Bhabha), and ultimately, to show how these
  composers were grappling with a particularly modern dilemma in their search
  for a more fluid self-identity as global citizens.</p>
