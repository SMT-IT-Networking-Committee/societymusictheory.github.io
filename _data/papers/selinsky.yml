title: "A Comparative Study of Indojazz Tihais"

abstract: |
  <p>Although the <i>tihai</i>, the characteristic tripartite cadence of
  Hindustani genres, has been explored in various Indian Classical and American
  minimalist settings, its near ubiquitous appearance in Indian Classical and
  jazz hybrids (Indojazz) of the last half century remains largely unstudied. In
  this new hybridized setting, how is the <i>tihai</i> reciprocally adapted to
  idiomatically jazz features? And how is the <i>tihai</i>’s role redefined for
  this context? </p>
  <p>To address these questions: First I use an original algebraic
  generalization of <i>tihai</i> structure to speculate on the device’s
  suitability for the phrase structures of modern jazz. Second, I examine
  <i>tihai</i>s from 1960s and 70s Indojazz recordings, including performances
  by Alla Rakha and Buddy Rich; Don Ellis and Harihar Rao’s Hindustani Jazz
  Sextet; Don Cherry and Latif Khan; and John Mayer and Joe Harriott’s Indo-Jazz
  Fusions to show that <i>tihai</i>s are often manipulated to suit the hybrid
  jazz syntax. Third, I provide a comparative analysis of every <i>tihai</i>
  from the first three albums of Shakti, John McLaughlin and L. Shankar’s
  mid-70s acoustic Indojazz group. Drawing on this analysis, I argue that the
  structure and metric positioning of Shakti’s <i>tihai</i>s often deviates from
  commonplace Hindustani usage and that these deviations consistently reflect
  formal and rhetorical roles special to the emergent Indojazz setting.</p>
