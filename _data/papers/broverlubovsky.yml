abstract: |
    <p>The treatment of dissonance—the cornerstone of the distinction between
    the prima and seconda pratica—by common consent is considered to be
    regulated by the purely musical context in the former versus the priority
    given to expressive-rhetorical considerations in the latter style. The
    theories and compositions by Francescantonio Calegari (1656–1742)
    challenge this common belief: his treatise <i>Ampla dimostrazione degli
    armoniali musicali tuoni</i> (1732) and his arrangements of the music of
    Cinquecento masters shed light on his genuine views of the treatment of
    dissonance with its inversions (known as the scuola dei rivolti).</p>
    <p>The Berlin Sing Akademie Archive contains the most representative
    collection of Calegari’s autograph arrangements of works by Palestrina,
    Asola, and other authors; it displays his keen interest in analyzing
    vertical sonorities and their succession in various modal contexts, with
    an emphasis on the correlation between the dissonances and emotionally
    laden words in the text.</p>
    <p>The most obvious element Calegari drew from the study of Palestrina’s
    works was combining dissonances with their consonant resolutions, thus
    creating very particular sonorities. He stated: “Whoever wants to write in
    the modern harmonic style must understand the old style. The theories
    expressed here are founded in the practice of Palestrina. Through these,
    one can now utilize the principles of the old school with the new modern
    taste.”</p>
    <p>Exploring Calegari’s theoretical premises vis-à-vis his analyses of old
    polyphonic works and his own surviving compositions calls into question
    our confidence in the unambiguous distinction between the place of
    dissonance in Prima versus Seconda pratica traditions.</p>
