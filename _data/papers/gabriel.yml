abstract: |
  <p>In the late Weimar Republic, German radio stations founded experimental
  studios that are perhaps best known today as supporters of post-World War II
  serialism and electronic music. The studios were established, however, as an
  extension of Weimar-era commissioning of musical radio plays and radio operas.
  Experimental studios allowed authors, musicians, and sound technicians to
  develop techniques, technologies, and dramaturgies that combined their
  mediums. The <i>Hörfolge</i>, for example, spliced together recorded
  newscasts, music, and sound effects. Without narration or dialogue, narrative
  and meaning emerged out of the sounds’ juxtaposition. </p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that these experimental works represent a
  development of the music theater of the <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i>. Drawing on
  the archival records of radio stations and key figures, as well as the
  discourse around radio, I trace a genealogy from stage works like Ernst
  Krenek’s <i>Jonny spielt auf</i> and Kurt Weill’s <i>Three Penny Opera</i>,
  through musical radio plays and radio operas like Walter Gronostay’s
  <i>Mord</i> and Walter Goehr’s <i>Malpopita</i>, to genres like the
  <i>Hörfolge</i> and the <i>Tonfilm</i>. In the latter, sound was recorded on
  the film used for sound film, and the markings on the film that constituted
  the recording were then manipulated by hand. In one <i>Tonfilm</i>, titled
  <i>Glocken</i> (<i>Bells</i>), a story about a young church bell-ringer was
  accompanied entirely by sounds derived by modifying a recording of a bell.
  </p>
  <p>The interest of <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i> composers like Paul Hindemith and
  Kurt Weill in radio music theater has been well explored, but radio
  represented only a small part of their agenda. I examine the work of a younger
  generation who completed their training in the late 1920s immersed in the
  aesthetics of the <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i> and found employment as house
  composers for radio stations, where they regularly produced new work to meet
  stations’ voracious demand. Many of these composers and technicians went on to
  work in the film industry, where they transferred their know-how into early
  sound film. My paper reveals an under-examined component of the music of the
  Weimar Republic and draws new connections between opera studies, film studies,
  sound studies, and the history of technology.</p>
