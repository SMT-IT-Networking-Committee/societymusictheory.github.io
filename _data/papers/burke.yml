abstract: |
  <p>On 25 August 1968, shortly before the Democratic National Convention in
  Chicago, MC5, a Michigan rock quintet, performed for protesters in Lincoln Park
  before fleeing as police stormed the area. This brief performance has become
  legendary, cited in histories of both rock and 1960s radicalism as a key
  example of rock musicians’ political engagement during the volatile year of
  1968. In this paper, I undertake a microhistorical investigation of the
  performance to examine a significant split in white radicals’ understanding of
  the role of African American music in revolutionary politics. </p>
  <p>White Yippies, such as Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, who helped to organize
  the Chicago protests promoted a stereotypical vision of African American urban
  masculinity as transgressive and macho. More than assert solidarity with black
  activists, they argued that they had become black (if only metaphysically) by
  living in accordance with these stereotypes. MC5, while sympathetic to such
  ideas, were invested in a different notion of authenticity centered on what
  1960s ethnomusicologists might have called “bi-musicality.” For MC5’s white
  members, musical knowledge and skill both inspired and justified political
  involvement; mastering black music was a way of demonstrating revolutionary
  authority and authenticity. This led the band to amalgamate blues, avant-garde
  jazz, and British rock into a compelling hybrid. Drawing on translation theory,
  I argue that MC5 sought to learn black music in order to <i>translate</i> it,
  taking its energy and principles and reworking them into a form that white
  musicians and radicals like themselves could use. Their approach involved both
  white misrepresentation and appropriation of black music and, in its historical
  moment, a comparatively respectful acknowledgment of the complex politics of
  such appropriation. In conclusion, I suggest ways in which examining MC5’s
  political stance might inform today’s debates over the ethics of white ally
  work in the Black Lives Matter era.</p>
