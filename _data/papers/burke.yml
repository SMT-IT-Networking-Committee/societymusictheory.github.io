    <p>Sega’s slogan “Genesis Does What Nintendon’t” banked on a modern, cool
    image that painted the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as childish and
    dated. It is somewhat ironic, however, that the Sega Genesis retained much of
    the 8-bit sounds and technology that the branding tried to leave behind. For
    this presentation, I consider audio design and the resulting compositional
    practices, arguing that the inclusion of two discrete sound sources, a
    Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) and a Frequency Modulation (FM) sound chip,
    as well as two central processing units (CPU), the Zilog Z80 and Motorola 68k,
    provide rare insight into music implementation choices among many developers.
    In my analysis, I distinguish audio implementation as a software choice,
    instead of a “hardware limitation” as one frequently encounters. Citing tracks
    from <i>Revenge of Shinobi</i> (1989), <i>Lightening</i> [sic] <i>Force</i>
    (1992), <i>Sol-Deace</i> (1992), and <i>Puggsy</i> (1993), among others, I
    address several musical parameters that are partially (if not mostly)
    understood as sound driver, rather than composer characteristics. At the
    initial level, I consider sound source: PSG, FM, and Pulse-Code Modulation
    (PCM) sampling. Next, I map audio channels to sound functions such as sound
    effects, leads, bass lines, pads, drum beats, and color. Finally, I consider
    more intricate techniques of sound design including chorusing, reverb, stereo
    panning, and overtone manipulation. Aligning these layers of score analysis
    sheds light on how various sound drivers harness the two sound chips and CPUs
    in different ways to make a certain set of possibilities available for
    composers. While some techniques, such as multi-channel echo and detuning, are
    remnants of the 8-bit era that are further explored with the expanded audio
    capabilities, others, such as bi-timbrality, MIDI conversion, and logic
    distribution, are more suggestive of conventions that would become prevalent
    in modern game composition. The sound design of the Sega Genesis therefore
    sheds as much light into early game music composition as it does on practices
    to follow.</p>
