title: "Headbanging to “Giant Steps”: Backbeat and Tempo Modulation in the Music of Panzerballett"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>The backbeat is a persistent rhythmic pattern in 4/4 that
  characteristically emphasizes beats 2 and 4. Its normative presence in popular
  music underscores its function in coordinating movements of musicians and
  listeners, but its status as either a metrical phenomenon or an aspect of
  rhythm is ambiguous. In this paper, I explore instances in which the
  backbeat’s ambiguity is highlighted precisely through its capacity to
  coordinate movement. In particular, I examine how the listeners’ bodily
  responses to the music of Panzerballett—a German heavy metal/jazz fusion
  band—can put to question the backbeat’s ontological status and its function in
  organizing music. In their cover of John Coltrane’s “Giant Steps,” the
  musicians of Panzerballett in a virtuosic fashion decouple the backbeat from
  the musical texture and use it to create rapid tempo modulations by
  effectively “hijacking” the musical context. I argue that they are able to do
  so because the backbeat is a persistent bodily activity that fulfills its
  function by virtue of listeners’ active responses to sound—here, headbanging.
  The backbeat exerts such a dominating presence because it is part of the
  body’s embodied knowledge of music as a temporal process. I suggest that the
  backbeat is neither simply an organizational schema that coordinates the
  movements of participants, nor solely an entrainable element necessary for
  meter in pop/rock music, but an aspect of cultural memory, a musical technique
  that links listeners and performers in a single bodily experience.</p>
