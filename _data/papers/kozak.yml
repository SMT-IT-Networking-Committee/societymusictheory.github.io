abstract: |
    <p>Despite its evocative title, Toshio Hosokawa’s <i>Vertical Time
    Study</i> <I>I</I> (1993) for clarinet, cello, and piano does not seem to
    cast any ambiguity on the issue of time. In fact, it unfolds in a
    relatively straightforward, linear manner, and appears to develop its
    initial gesture within a squarely conventional form. Thus, the trio begins
    with low intensity, builds up to a climax by fragmentation and an increase
    in rhythmic activity, and eventually returns to the quiet opening.
    However, this reading obscures an unusual temporality that underlies the
    piece, a temporality that might very well be construed as “vertical,” if
    only in the sense of contradicting the more typical “horizontal” impulses
    of teleology or closure. To highlight this aspect, I propose that the
    development of the trio’s opening gesture is cast within a structure that
    can be effectively explicated using formal properties of affects. In this
    paper, I argue that affects are socially constructed and culturally
    stipulated spatial and temporal forms of our engagement with the world.
    Based on the premise that musical structure is created by listeners as
    they affectively engage with music, I suggest that when used as analytical
    tools, the formal properties of affects offer a productive framework for
    interpreting contemporary music in which composers challenge traditional
    concepts and experiences of temporality. I demonstrate this claim by
    exploring how Hosokawa is able to contravene the illusory sense of linear
    development by using intensities—loudness, articulation, and silence—as
    materials that shape the recurrence of the opening gesture.</p>
