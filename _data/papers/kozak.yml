    <p>In this talk I examine the relationship between time, embodiment, and affectivity in music. I argue that music is temporal not because it unfolds in time, or because it takes time as its vector, or even because it has the capacity to alter our sense of temporal flow. Rather, music is a temporal artform because it is constituted by a situated body moving in relation to sound. Like other artforms, music isolates, extends, and intensifies the dynamical patterns of our everyday engagement with our environment. This engagement folds ongoing processes into the body’s own temporal frame, giving them a past, a present, and a future. Since humans are fundamentally animate creatures, this folding-into is achieved through a moving body. In this view, musical time is a system of affects—intensive qualities—that define the nature of our openness to the world. Musical time is something felt in a physical, kinesthetic sense through a body that responds to sound by intelligibly coordinating its movements in different ways. Because of its intimate link with the moving body, music has the capacity to orient, reorient, and even disorient our temporal frame by altering the physicality of our engagement with sound.</p>
