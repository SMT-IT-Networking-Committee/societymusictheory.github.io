abstract: |
  <p>During Venice’s self-proclaimed “Year of Todi” (1791), operagoers claimed
  they heard singer Luigia Todi’s “sensitive soul” manifested through her “vocal
  defects” (<i>Gazzetta urbana veneta</i>). In particular, her “suffocated”
  timbre seemed to make audible something quite unexpected: her feminine
  “domestic virtues” (<i>Lettera d’un filarmonico</i>). Casting vocal
  difficulties as indicative of (gendered) interiority rather than poor training
  departed significantly from the predominant Italianate aesthetics of opera
  seria voice, in which ease of production and seamless registration were
  considered essential. Even Giuseppe Millico, a castrato famous for “coloring
  [his] voice” with passion, argued that voices had to be trained out of their
  defects in order to move the heart (<i>La pietà d’amore</i>, 1782).
  Nevertheless, Venetian critics and fans celebrated Todi’s defective voice as
  uniquely capable of teaching listeners how to feel.</p>
  <p>This talk analyzes the Venetian reception of Todi’s voice through the lens
  of coeval Italian attitudes towards women’s bodies, voices, and
  subjectivities. Beginning in the 1760s, women’s presence in the emergent
  public sphere was regarded by reform-minded literati as undermining the
  progress of an “enlightened” political agenda (<i>Difesa delle donne</i>;
  <i>L’Amico delle fanciulle</i>). According to male intellectuals, women had to
  embrace affective labor within the home, especially the task of moral
  edification, in order to attain some measure of “social utility” (Landes 1988;
  Messbarger 2002). By tracing the interconnected themes of domesticity and
  female voice into the 1790s through periodicals, treatises, novels, and
  operas, I read the discourses on Todi’s singing as highly contingent
  mediations of Italian anxieties surrounding women’s role in “Enlightenment
  progress.”</p>
  <p>Building on recent musicological studies of the ways in which cultural
  attitudes influence the production and interpretation of vocal timbres (Stras
  2006; Eidsheim 2008; Davies 2014), this talk weaves together elements from
  intellectual history, feminist theory, disability studies, and voice studies
  in order to argue for a critical transformation in the aesthetics and
  ideologies of women’s voices at the end of the eighteenth century. I thus show
  how, and why, listeners came to imagine the “defective” sound of Todi’s voice
  as being the “moral cause” of enlightened society (<i>Dissertazione ragionata
  sul teatro</i>).</p>
