    <p>Scholars have shown increasing interest in applying the methodologies of Caplin and Hepokoski and Darcy to nineteenth-century form. These efforts often proceed under the assumption that classical norms continued to influence romantic practice, even in the face of nineteenth-century innovations. Vande Moortele terms this approach “negative” in the sense that it interprets what <em>does</em> occur in romantic form in relation to classical constructs. He contrasts this methodology with an as-of-yet-unrealized “positive” theory that would derive its concepts directly from nineteenth-century music.</p>
    <p>A multi-part strategy interrogates the positive methodology championed by Vande Moortele and such like-minded theorists as Horton and Wingfield. Examination of Horton’s recent analysis of the first movement of Brahms’s First Symphony reveals the presence of classical norms casting a “negative” light—although a beneficial one—on his presumably “positive” methodology. A corpus study of S theme cadence in Dvořák’s mature chamber music follows, responding both to Horton’s concern for tonal delay in his Brahms analysis, and to his and Vande Moortele’s calls for expanding the range of composers included in these endeavors. Attention to a less-studied composer betrays the persistent gravitational pull of classical conventions, in contrast to the argument that a romantic-centered corpus would diminish that pull. Finally, analysis of Dvořák’s op. 87, I, and op. 61, I and IV, illustrates limitations of corpus study as contrasted with close reading. The close readings underscore the need to engage both circumpolar norms and progressive developments, even in music written late in the nineteenth century.</p>
