  <p>With electronic technology sound can be controlled more precisely,
  drastically altered within microseconds, or subtly changed over several
  minutes. There are many methods of altering sounds electronically, including
  changing the pitch, rhythm, volume, timbre (spectral content), attack, decay,
  panning, and reverberation. This paper investigates these changes in
  contemporary electronic dance music (EDM), focusing on the musical and
  aesthetic functions of continuous processes, which gradually modify musical
  parameters fluidly, not in a discrete, “step-by-step” fashion. Examples of
  continuous processes include fade-ins, accelerations, pitch slides, and filter
  sweeps. Existing analytical scholarship on EDM has focused on clearly discrete
  processes, especially metrical dissonance and the sudden addition or
  subtraction of sound layers (Butler 2006; Hawkins 2003; Solberg 2014).</p>
  <p>Any music created with digital technology is discrete at some level, but
  there is a perceptual continuum between clearly discrete processes and clearly
  continuous ones, with what Danielsen (2010) calls “micro-rhythm” in the
  middle. The perception of these processes as continuous or discrete can differ
  depending on the parameter(s) being altered, the rate of change, simultaneous
  processes in other layers, and/or the listener’s knowledge of the
  compositional process. This presentation will examine several EDM tracks,
  focusing on perceived continuous processes such as the gradual cyberization of
  a voice in “Find a Way” (2017) by acclaimed producer Wolfgang Gartner. My
  analyses will show that continuous processes have a variety of functions,
  including building or relieving tension, and orienting or disorienting
  listeners to hypermetric boundaries.</p>
