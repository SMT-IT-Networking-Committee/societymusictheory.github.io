    <p>Steely Dan is widely recognized as a leading American jazz-rock band
    with sales of over 40 million albums worldwide. This study examines the
    distinctive approach to stylistic borrowing and juxtaposition evident in
    the band’s performances and integral to the songwriting of core band
    members Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. With examples selected from the
    band’s many hit songs in the 1970s as well as their meticulous studio
    compositions from 2000–2003, the paper explores how Steely Dan’s music is
    broadly ironic it its approach to musical genre, strategically positioning
    gestures laden with cultural meaning to create oppositions of expression
    and syntax that result in the projection of musical irony.</p>

    <p>Building upon previous investigations of melodic/harmonic conflict that
    have been called “the melodic-harmonic divorce in rock,” this study
    examines Steely Dan’s strategic juxtaposition of material projecting
    different and even conflicting gestural, topical, and structural
    implications. The music of Steely Dan has received previous analytical
    attention that has focused on its jazz-influenced harmonic complexity and
    sophistication. This study shows through a close examination of musical
    gesture how Becker and Fagen juxtapose stylistically divergent elements
    that resonate with jazz traditions and support an ironic edge in their
    music, while steadfastly maintaining an authentic grounding in
    pentatonic-based rock. The analysis further explores how musical and
    social meanings are mediated through a topical discourse that enacts a
    comedic narrative, projecting juxtapositions and figural incongruities
    that are comparable to topical relationships that have been examined in
    eighteenth-century opera buffa.</p>
