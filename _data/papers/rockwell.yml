abstract: |
  <p>Music, Claude Lévi-Strauss memorably declared, is “untranslatable.”
  Contemporary authors who have cited him have done little to argue against this
  idea, since music lacks the semantic precision of language. But such a view
  regards translation to be an inherently textual enterprise, while leaving the
  possibilities of non-linguistic translation unexplored. Given that humans
  communicate through music, and if, as George Steiner claimed, “human
  communication equals translation,” then it is conceivable that not only is
  music translatable but that translation is central to musical experience.</p>
  <p>What are the possibilities for non-linguistic translation in music, and how
  can they be heard? This paper approaches the question by combining translation
  theory and analysis of American roots music selections including blues,
  sentimental song, bluegrass, and Western swing. Audio recordings of such music
  foreground translation as a constant process, since musicians create melodies
  particular to their instruments without a prescriptive score or definitive
  version. Analyzing, imagining, and listening to motion in their performances
  suggests how translation can be a basis for a theory of musical change. </p>
