abstract: |
  <p>In January 2000, artist P. Craig Russell began publication of his
  fourteen-volume graphic novel adaptation of Richard Wagner’s <i>Ring of the
  Nibelung</i>. The culmination of some twenty years’ labor, Russell’s work took
  the comic book world by storm, earning its creator a prestigious Eisner Award.
  The grand marriage of his luxurious images with Patrick Mason’s attentive
  translation of the libretto proved to be ideally suited to the medium,
  satisfying readers unfamiliar with Wagner’s music as well as those who had
  some experience of the Ring in its musical form. As Michael Kennedy noted in
  the preface to the collected edition, “In the world of Superman and Batman,
  Siegfried and Siegmund acquire a new dimension without losing their heroic
  status.” </p>
  <p>In this paper, I will argue that Russell’s adaptation epitomizes Wagner’s
  concept of “deeds of music made visible.” Although Russell’s <i>Ring</i> takes
  place in a world without sound, I will demonstrate the various ways in which
  the images and text convey musical ideas. I am particularly interested in
  those moments where Russell elaborates on stories and actions that remain
  unseen in Wagner’s work, such as Wotan’s “great idea” at the end of <i>Das
  Rheingold</i>, and the prehistory of <i>Die Walküre</i>. As Russell himself
  observes, opera is, “possibly the most difficult form to adapt from, the most
  resistant to change. Paradoxically, it can be the very abstraction of music
  that allows the visual artist greater latitude to call on all the visual
  devices of symbolism, surrealism, and expressionism.” Russell’s <i>Ring</i> is
  not a parody or satire in the manner of Anna Russell (no relation) or Looney
  Tunes: it is a serious, thoughtful work of art which, sadly, has garnered
  little attention from the musicological community. Yet the graphic novel is a
  popular medium in the twenty-first century. Russell effectively brings
  Wagner’s work to a new audience, one not necessarily interested in opera. By
  making “deeds of music” visible, his <i>Ring of the Nibelung</i> may be
  perceived as a form of public musicology, one with tremendous potential to
  reinvigorate an historical artifact with new life and new meaning. </p>
