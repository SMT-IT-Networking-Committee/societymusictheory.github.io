      bio: |
        <p>Clifton Boyd is a Ph.D. candidate in music theory at Yale University. His dissertation, “The Role of Vernacular Music Theory in the American Barbershop Community,” examines how American vernacular music institutions utilize music theory to influence and affirm social and political values within their communities, especially as it pertains to racial and gender discrimination. His research has been supported by the Margery Morgan Lowens Dissertation Research Fellowship (2020) from the Society for American Music and the Howard Mayer Brown Fellowship (2020) from the American Musicological Society. He is also the founder of Project Spectrum, a graduate student-led coalition committed to increasing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in music academia. On behalf of Project Spectrum, he is twice a recipient of the Sphinx Organization’s MPower Artist Grant (2018, 2020). His writing on diversity in academia has been featured in <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>.</p>

    <p>The Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS) has long concerned itself with the preservation of the barbershop style—in fact, the BHS was founded in 1938 as the “Society for the <em>Preservation</em> and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America.” While this may seem like a harmless detail, the BHS’s characteristic aversion to change is also reflected in its history of racial and gender discrimination. The Society recently launched a new diversity initiative, “Everyone in Harmony” (2017–), but the question remains: how is the changing social culture of the BHS reflected in the musical aesthetics it values?</p>
    <p>In this paper I treat the BHS as a case study for how communities leverage musical style in processes of institution building. I discuss several style treatises published by the BHS—these texts are prime examples of what I term “vernacular music theory,” i.e. music theory that is produced by practitioners, for practitioners. I argue that while the Society has relaxed its harmonic requirements over time, their impulse to preserve the style has limited the forms of barbershop allowed in competition and other settings, which has directly impacted the demographics of those who choose to engage with the style. Furthermore, I reflect on the BHS’s contemporary moment as they learn to accommodate women’s and mixed-gender ensembles through the “Everyone in Harmony” initiative. I conclude by arguing that the BHS’s pursuit of balance between preservation and modernization provides insight into academic practices of music theory, most notably our field’s recent efforts to “reframe music theory.”</p>
