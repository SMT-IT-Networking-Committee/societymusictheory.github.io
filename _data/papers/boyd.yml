    <p>The Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS) has long concerned itself with the preservation of the barbershop style—in fact, the BHS was founded in 1938 as the “Society for the <em>Preservation</em> and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America.” While this may seem like a harmless detail, the BHS’s characteristic aversion to change is also reflected in its history of racial and gender discrimination. The Society recently launched a new diversity initiative, “Everyone in Harmony” (2017–), but the question remains: how is the changing social culture of the BHS reflected in the musical aesthetics it values?</p>
    <p>In this paper I treat the BHS as a case study for how communities leverage musical style in processes of institution building. I discuss several style treatises published by the BHS—these texts are prime examples of what I term “vernacular music theory,” i.e. music theory that is produced by practitioners, for practitioners. I argue that while the Society has relaxed its harmonic requirements over time, their impulse to preserve the style has limited the forms of barbershop allowed in competition and other settings, which has directly impacted the demographics of those who choose to engage with the style. Furthermore, I reflect on the BHS’s contemporary moment as they learn to accommodate women’s and mixed-gender ensembles through the “Everyone in Harmony” initiative. I conclude by arguing that the BHS’s pursuit of balance between preservation and modernization provides insight into academic practices of music theory, most notably our field’s recent efforts to “reframe music theory.”</p>
