  <p>Originally published as an ametric, modular, and partially aleatoric work
  for string septet, John Adams’s <i>Shaker Loops</i> (1978) was revised and
  republished for string orchestra four years later. Adams states in the
  prefatory material to the 1982 version that it “is, in effect, one of the many
  possible realizations of the modular version, [with] all repeats [...] written
  out.” This description, however, is terribly understated, given the numerous
  rhythmic alterations contained in the revised version (Jemian 2001). Moreover,
  adapting Cohn’s (2019) terminology, it obscures the work’s shift from having
  only minimal meter to possessing deep meter.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I argue that the experiences of the conductor, performers,
  and audience alike undergo a remarkable transformation due to the imposition
  of deep meter on a previously minimally-metric work. Through an analysis of
  the work’s first movement, “Shaking and Trembling,” I explore how Adams, in
  his role as what I call the “virtual conductor,” not only does away with the
  aleatoric elements of the original version, but also removes much of the
  agency previously afforded to those involved with the work’s performance.
  Furthermore, I examine how, through the publication of the revised version,
  Adams exerts a different form of compositional authority, discouraging
  renditions that differ from his own while promoting one that cannot be created
  from the original modular version alone. I conclude by considering how the
  work has been received over the last several decades in both of its forms, and
  how it demonstrates larger trends in minimalist music composition and
  consumption.</p>
