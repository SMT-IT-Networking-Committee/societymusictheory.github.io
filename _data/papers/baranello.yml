  <p>For New York audiences of the 1940s, Viennese operetta was passé. For the
  composers and librettists who fled Europe it was a remnant of a lost world—and
  their livelihood. In this paper, I consider exile composer Emmerich Kálmán and
  his musicals <i>Miss Underground</i> (1941) and <i>Marinka</i> (1945). His
  wartime works evinced his own alienation but also consistently propagated a
  timely, anti-isolationist message, one which New York audiences were not ready
  to receive in what seemed to be a Germanic guise. As seen in letters preserved
  from this period, artists such as Oscar Straus, Paul Abraham, and Alfred
  Grünwald faced similar crises, suggesting new dimensions of Austria’s musical
  diaspora, particularly for those outside Hollywood.</p>
  <p><i>Miss Underground</i>, a collaboration with Lorenz Hart, Paul Gallico,
  and George Balanchine, was never completed due to Hart’s death and remains
  unperformed. I will present a partial reconstruction from fragments in the
  Austrian National Library. The story of a Manhattan girl detective in Paris
  spying for the Resistance in an Italian circus, it is remarkable for its comic
  yet complex treatment of collaboration and conscription. Kálmán composed in
  what he thought a modern style, including a foxtrot, a beguine, and the parody
  “Alexander’s Blitzkrieg Band.” I argue the fusion, as well as the story
  itself, represent an attempt at anti-isolationist persuasion, which would have
  been rare for 1941 Broadway.</p>
  <p>Kálmán’s somber <i>Marinka</i> (1945), written with George Marion Jr., was
  a more successful synthesis, enjoying a modest Broadway run. A rewriting of
  Crown Prince Rudolf’s tragic “Mayerling Affair,” it is a sentimental story
  with traditionally Viennese music wrapped in an American frame narrative. Yet
  Marion and Kálmán’s Rudolf becomes an unlikely spokesman for the Allies,
  stepping out of the story to sing an anthem, “Brave New World,” and similarly
  the parody “Old Man Danube” positions its Habsburg characters as victims of a
  yet unimagined future. <i>Marinka</i>’s self-consciously false ending imagines
  a Rudolf who lived, a Europe that remained whole. Yet audiences were not
  receptive to this alternative history, however explicitly its incongruous
  message was telegraphed.</p>
