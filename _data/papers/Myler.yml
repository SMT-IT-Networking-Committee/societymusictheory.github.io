abstract: | 
    <p>Results from cognitive studies of polytonal perception have been equivocal as to whether listeners can hear multiple tonal centers simultaneously (Krumhansl and Schmuckler 1986; Thompson and Mor 1992). From a phenomenological perspective, a methodological drawback of such studies is their reliance on the post-test probe tone paradigm. That is, establishing listeners’ retrospective awareness of concurrent keys does little to address the experience of perceiving conflicting tonal centers as polytonal music progresses in real time. In this paper, I aim to reorient the discussion of polytonality around this experience and argue that the perceptual challenge of polytonal discriminability inheres in the ongoing present, resulting in a multistable phenomenon wherein a listener toggles between competing tonal hierarchies. </p>
    <p>I take Husserl’s account of time-consciousness ([1928] 1991) as the foundation for my multistable model. For Husserl, temporal objects are apprehended within a dynamically unfolding tripartite process of <em>retention—primal impression—protention</em> that engenders a certain unity in consciousness. I argue that polytonal music disrupts the unity of Husserl’s temporal model, and it is this feature that induces multistable switching between tonal centers. To depict this process, I adapt Lewin’s (1986) p-model and ground it explicitly in Husserl’s time-diagrams, investigating a network of temporally situated p-relationships (or P-net). I apply the P-net to excerpts from Ives, Milhaud, Bach, Britten, and Prokofiev. In so doing, I argue that the loose term “polytonality” encompasses a wide spectrum of compositional techniques and I demonstrate the P-net’s versatility in exploring the ongoing temporal landscapes of such variegated works.</p>
