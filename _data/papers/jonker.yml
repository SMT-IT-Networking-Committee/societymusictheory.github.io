abstract: |
    <p>Dissonant counterpoint, a compositional technique used by “ultra-modernist” composers in America during the 1920s and 1930s, is designed to exclude tonal references through a rigorous process of “dissonation.” A treatise co-authored by Charles Seeger and Ruth Crawford outlines the precepts of dissonant counterpoint, whose ultimate goal was for polyphonic voices to “sound apart,” or be independent, to create “heterophony” (Seeger 1994 [1930]).</p>
    <p>Vivian Fine (1913–2000), Crawford’s most prolific and successful student, followed the compositional style of her teacher in many ways (Lumsden 2017), including the use of dissonant counterpoint in the music she wrote while studying, or shortly after studying, with Crawford. But there is one important and previously unnoted exception: within a generally dissonant framework, Fine’s music makes extensive reference to tonal materials, including melodic fourths and fifths, and major and minor triads. The coalescence of these two irreconcilable forces creates a tension that suggests a new kind of heterophony, one in which the “sounding apart” occurs between the tonal references and the dissonant framework that struggles to contain them.</p>
    <p>By analyzing several of Fine’s ultra-modernist pieces, I aim to show the ways in which she manipulated dissonant counterpoint into her own unique style, one in which tonal materials play a fundamental role in the heterophonic “sounding apart.” Ultimately, this paper extends the notion of dissonance beyond the quality of an interval or chord to include the conceptual conflict between consonances and dissonances themselves.</p>
