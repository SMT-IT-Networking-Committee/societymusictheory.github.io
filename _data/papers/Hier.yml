abstract: | 
    <p>I propose a theory of harmony for Schoenberg’s atonal music (roughly 1909–1916) in which voice-leading distances in a two-voice contrapuntal structure are arranged to form a normative cadence.  The contrapuntal structure contains an ascending structural voice (ASV) and a descending structural voice (DSV).  The two voices converge or diverge in pitch space.  Each voice progresses by semitone(s) (S), then by larger interval(s) (N), then by whole tone(s) (W), and finally by semitone(s), forming the cadence, S–N–W–S.  I term the voice-leading distances “chromatic functions” because they recall the syntactic ordering of Riemann’s (1896) tonal functions.  I link the semitone’s role in my theory to its connective role in late romantic voice leading, and provide a typology of cadences and a graphical system for tracing a piece’s chromatic structure.  I conclude with a detailed treatment of the harmonic, motivic, and phrase-structural features of the first number of Schoenberg’s <em>Sechs kleine Klavierstücke</em>, Op. 19.</p>
