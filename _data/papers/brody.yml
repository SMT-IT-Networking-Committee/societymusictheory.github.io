    <p>As nineteenth- and twentieth-century composers adapted the late-eighteenth-century sonata model, they were at pains to solve two related “problems,” or points of aesthetic unsatisfactoriness that (their music suggests) they discerned in earlier works. The <em>first-movement problem</em> is the sense that the main structural–narrative interest is frequently dissipated too early—around the beginning of the recapitulation. The <em>multimovement problem</em> is the sense that, since first movements are usually the longest, weightiest, most complicated, and most goal-directed movements in a three- or four-movement work, the entire multimovement structure begins with its most interesting material and leaves less to look forward to later. Concepts from Susanne Langer’s <em>Feeling and Form</em> clarify what is at stake: while eighteenth-century works often emphasize <em>comic rhythms</em> (circular, ritualistic, impersonal, exteriorized), later music steadily shifts toward <em>tragic rhythms</em> (teleological, individualized, personal) in both first-movement and multimovement form.</p>
    <p>In this paper I sketch four distinctive and compelling solutions to these two problems in two works each by Amy Beach and Nikolai Medtner. Beach’s Violin Sonata (1896) addresses the first-movement problem in a Brahmsian way (movement 1) and again in an innovative Type 1–Type 2 hybrid form (movement 4). Medtner’s Sonata in G minor, op. 22 (1909–1910) engages the same problem with a “failed development” that keeps the structural ball in the air until the movement’s coda. Finally, Medtner’s <em>Night Wind</em> Sonata (1911) imaginatively confronts the multimovement problem by building two sonata structures within a frame that catastrophically undoes the resolution provisionally achieved within each.</p>
