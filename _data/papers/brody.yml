abstract: |
  <p>Among the many vital contributions of Leonard Ratner’s 1980 treatise
  <i>Classic Music</i> is his differentiation between <i>solar</i> and
  <i>polar</i> tonal schemes for eighteenth-century music, the former supposedly
  characteristic of Baroque genres, the latter of the newer genres of
  mid-century and later. Solar schemes are those that move through closely
  related keys without special preference for any of them, while polar schemes
  are those built around a fundamental tonic-dominant opposition, relegating any
  additional keys used to a tertiary status. This paper develops two related
  claims about the ramifications that this still under-theorized distinction
  holds for individual works and for larger repertoires.</p>
  <p>First, the solar-polar distinction exaggerates the dominant’s lesser status
  in some Baroque genres. Using data from Baroque concertos, chorales, and
  binary dances, I show that the dominant had a unique role in large-scale tonal
  structure even in the most overtly “solar” repertoires; in this sense, the
  solar-polar distinction is one of degree rather than of kind.</p>
  <p>Second, solarity and polarity are contrasting approaches to the
  <i>temporality</i> of motion through tonal space, with a connection to the
  trajectory of form in eighteenth-century music. While solar works move through
  nontonic keys at a variable rate, polar works confine tertiary keys to brief
  and generically constrained formal timespans. The implied evolutionary path
  sees tonality and form move in tandem: the larger forms of the late eighteenth
  century developed from the relatively polar small forms of the Baroque,
  pushing aside the solarity of Baroque large forms.</p>
