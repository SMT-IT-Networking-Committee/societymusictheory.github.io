title: "Using Interactive Software to Enhance Mapping of Complex Multi-dimensional and Dynamic Musical Relationships"
handouts: []
abstract: |
    <p>Analytical charts and diagrams have traditionally been printed on paper
    and as such have been fixed and static. The two-dimensional page is also
    limited in the amount of information that can be presented clearly.
    However, musical structures are, more often than not, very complex, with
    multiple interrelations which evolve dynamically.</p>
    <p>This presentation will examine ways in which software can help
    facilitate analytical representations that better reflect this complexity
    and multi-dimensionality of dynamically transforming interrelations.
    Examples will be presented from previously completed analyses and current
    work on the IRiMaS project (‘Interactive Research in Music as Sound,’
    funded for five years, 2017–22, by a European Research Council Advanced
    Grant) will also be discussed and illustrated. An aim of this project is
    to extend such analytical techniques to a broader repertoire and
    facilitate their wider use. Our analyses to date were produced as
    completed packages with the participation of expert programmers. One
    aspect of IRiMaS involves developing tools for use by non-technical music
    researchers, enabling them to adopt a similar analytical approach,
    creating their own extensible interactive analyses independently of
    specialist technical support. These tools are also being developed so as
    to encourage use with a much broader range of musics, including
    non-Western music, aural/oral traditions, improvisation, and spectral
    music. Interactive aural software offers new possibilities for analysts,
    with the opportunity to enhance the way analysis is presented, and it also
    potentially changes the way analysts and their readers work.</p>
