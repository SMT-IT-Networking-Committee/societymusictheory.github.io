    <p>Several recent publications on texted music highlight how certain poetic forms lend themselves naturally to settings as musical sentences (BaileyShea 2019, 2004, and 2003; Rodgers 2014; Callahan 2013; Martin 2010). BaileyShea (2019) identifies early appearances of musical sentences in seventeenth-century British ballads, where the poetic structure of limericks aligns astonishingly well with the structure of musical sentences. Rodgers (2014) argues that Schubert’s musical sentences “often go hand in hand with poems that <em>begin</em> with rhyming couplets” (italics mine).</p>
    <p>However, the quatrain generally opposes the construction and rhetorical nature of the musical sentence. Whereas quatrains are evenly divided structures, usually AABB or ABAB (where A and B indicate end-rhymes, but are equivalent in poetic meter), musical sentences exhibit an uneven profile, such as AAB or AA′B (with a 1:1:2 ratio). In Richard Strauss’s musical settings of quatrains, lines 1 and 2 of the poem comprise the presentation phrase, and lines 3 and 4 comprise the continuation phrase. Invariably, Strauss treats the end of line 3 with great care to mask the division point in the poetry and maintain an uninterrupted continuation phrase. Through analyses of several songs, I examine Strauss’s two main strategies for setting quatrains as musical sentences: (1) to fill in the gap between lines 3 and 4 with melodic-motivic fragments derived from the basic idea, or (2) to position certain harmonies (usually structural pre-dominants) at the end of line 3, creating harmonic and voice-leading threads that conceal the poetic juncture and thrust the continuation phrase toward its cadence.</p>
