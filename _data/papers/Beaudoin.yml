    <p>The field of music theory operates according to countless unwritten, unspoken agreements that quietly regulate its content. These insidious norms have historically funneled scholarly activity towards notated scores by white, male, able-bodied persons. Redirecting these currents, writings by William Cheng, Philip Ewell, Ellie Hisama, and Loren Kajikawa suggest that music departments would be more interesting, healthy, and populated places if all music — and all theorists — counted. This is not simply a platitude: an ongoing curricular transformation will be offered as a case study of the impact that these scholars have had on the creation of new courses and avenues of research.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the proposals set forth in Hisama’s “Getting to Count,” I will raise questions about theory’s entrenched center/periphery binary: Which works are granted ‘citizenship’ at our conferences? Which performers receive analytical attention? Which interpreters are ‘allowed’ to record which repertoire? And within audio recordings, which sounds matter? This last question might seem trivial, but it is teeming with hermeneutic life: our collective appraisal about what ‘counts’ as music — and who does the counting — reinforces an undue sanctity for the composer’s score as determinative of meaningful content while simultaneously marginalizing the sounds made by the bodies of performers. (This includes the common and disturbing practice of suppressing the sound of musicians breathing.) New research that analyzes and celebrates the totality of sounding bodies is offered as a small contribution to the larger epistemic changes occurring within music departments and the SMT.</p>
