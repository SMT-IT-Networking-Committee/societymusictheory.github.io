title: Metrical Phase Shift and Dance Topics in Stravinsky's Ballets
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>For the dances and marches of the eighteenth-century topical lexicon,
    meter is a defining characteristic (Ratner 1980; Allanbrook 1983).
    Although many of these topics are observed in works of the early twentieth
    century, the metrical irregularity of this repertory raises challenging
    epistemological and interpretive questions about how this music can
    sustain such tokens. This study uses the concept of metrical phase shift
    to articulate “normative” or unmarked (Hatten 1994) behavior for dance
    topics in Stravinsky’s ballets. Woodruff (2006) uses metrical phase shift
    to show how surface irregularity in Stravinsky can be understood as
    movement between evenly staggered phases of a single prevailing meter. By
    privileging a single metric identity, this framework helps to identify and
    refine the interpretation of metrically-defined topics in modernist
    repertory. Caution must be exercised when interpreting topics in
    Stravinsky’s music, because metrical phase shift occurs frequently in
    Stravinsky’s music, potentially rendering it an unmarked characteristic.
    This point is illustrated through a reconsideration of irony in the “Royal
    March” from <i>L’histoire du Soldat</i>. In exploring topics through this
    approach, one also gains greater clarity into the phenomenon of metrical
    phase shift itself. Whereas Woodruff identifies work-specific motives as
    instrumental to the perception of phase shift, closer examination of
    passages from <i>The Rite of Spring</i> and <i>L’histoire </i>reveals that
    such metrically-constrained motives often belong to broader topical
    identities. It is through the topics’ <i>figurae</i> (Rumph 2011, 2014),
    such as stock accompaniment patterns and characteristic rhythmic motives,
    that the metrical identity is projected.</p>
