    <p>This presentation begins with a review of the “traditionalist,” “mild revision,” “fundamental revision” approaches to curriculum reform in undergraduate theory teaching; particular attention is given to the high-brow/low-brow culture divide and how prioritizing classical music can create a “high-brow lens” that complicates the inclusion of music outside the Western canon of classical music. I then spell out briefly but specifically how a fundamental revision in the core theory curriculum could work in a pragmatic sense, using my own courses at the University of Rochester as a work-in-progress example. My approach employs five broad theoretical dimensions, all applicable (to a certain degree) to the music studied in the course. These are harmony, melody, rhythm and meter, form, and texture. Students analyze entire movements or songs (in almost all cases) and contrasting styles are considered in light of each of these five theoretical dimensions. I argue that such an approach can serve to flatten the high-brow/low-brow divide, since non-classical music is not viewed through a high-brow lens formed by the stylistic norms and practices of common practice period music. Such revision can be broad enough to be inclusive (not privileging any particular style), rigorous enough to provide depth in the learning experience (not a “watering down” of traditional teaching), and flexible enough to account for a wide variety of repertory (and differing repertory knowledge, expertise, and experience among theory faculty). </p>
