title: "Voices of Richard the Lionheart: Emotion, Masculinity, and Self Presentation in Two Medieval Laments"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Songs of lament circulated widely in France and Occitania, and perform
  grief in ways that highlight conventions of singing and the expressiveness of
  the individual lyric voice. While often associated with women’s rituals,
  laments played a key role in expressing medieval emotions connected with
  masculine fraternity and royal or military relationships. Interrelated songs
  of lament pertaining to the iconic Richard the Lionheart invite exploration of
  such vocalities. This paper examines late-twelfth-century voices pertaining to
  the complex and troublesome figure of Richard, and situates their
  interconnections within their soundscapes and contexts. Employing close
  readings and textual-melodic analysis, and engaging related scholarship by
  Judith Peraino and Emma Dillon, I demonstrate how these voices encompass
  authorial expression, performativity, expressions of mourning, and gendered
  possibilities.</p>
  <p><i>Ja nus homs pris</i>, Richard’s best-known song and only piece with
  extant musical notation, survives in both French and Occitan. Having fallen
  captive in Austria (1192–94) at the end of the Third Crusade, Richard laments
  his own position. He bewails his imprisonment, even adopting several
  conventions of the abandoned, angered Lady, and musically broadcasts his
  despair. I read the melodic-textual material of this song as a public,
  lyricized weeping—prayerful, performative, and suggestive of some of the
  gendered ambiguities that surround Richard himself.</p>
  <p>Richard’s hapless death in 1199 inspired another lament, <i>Fortz chausa
  es</i> by troubadour Gaucelm Faidit, one of the most popular songs of the
  troubadour era, and a rare instance of an Occitan planh whose music survives.
  Memorializing Richard’s virtues, the narrator finds himself often dumbstruck
  with loss. Yet this six-stanza piece fully develops the voice of Gaucelm’s
  narrator, who portrays himself performing the act of lamenting and refers to
  the act of his own singing. Various details of the expansive and expressive
  melody underscore emotionally experiential moments and the acoustic rendering
  of sorrow. The masculine narrator adopts the voice of a subservient; hopeless
  and overwhelmed by emotional loss, he longs for Richard as courtly ideal. </p>
  <p>These interconnected songs, dialoguing around Richard’s isolation and
  liminality, resound today. Together they explicate musical voices within
  monophonic lyric as they articulate gendered ideals, mourning, and authorial
  selves.</p>
