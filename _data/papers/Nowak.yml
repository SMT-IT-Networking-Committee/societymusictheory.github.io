        <p>Jeremy Nowak is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Music Theory at the University of North Texas, and holds a B.M. in Composition from Palm Beach Atlantic University and an M.M. in Music Theory from Texas Tech University. His presentation today is drawn from his dissertation, which he plans to defend in the Spring, and considers formal organization in Robert Schumann’s piano music. Besides Romantic form, Jeremy’s other research interests include rhythm and meter, late-Renaissance madrigals, and pop music.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>William Caplin’s (2018) “dissipated cadence,” and Poundie Burstein’s (2014) “disrupted ending” refer to phrases that end on the penultimate dominant when the expected authentic cadence fails to materialize. The difference between these types of phrase endings and a half-cadential progression is that the dominant harmony functions as the ultimate harmony in the latter, not penultimate. In the piano music of Robert Schumann, phrases are often fragmentary in nature and can terminate before a cadence or cadential harmonic progression ever materializes. As a result, the terms “dissipated cadence” and “disrupted ending” are perhaps too restrictive to describe the more fragmentary passages of Schumann. Through the lens of Robert Schumann’s piano music, however, the ideas set forth by both Caplin and Burstein can be expanded upon to not only deepen our understanding of phrase endings, but to also overcome the limitations of some current terminology. </p>
