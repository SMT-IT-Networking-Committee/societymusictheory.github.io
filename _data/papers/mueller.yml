        <p>Dorian Mueller is a doctoral candidate in music theory at the University of Michigan. She holds an M.A. in Music Theory from Penn State University and a B.A. in Mathematics from Rutgers University. Her research interests include musical narrativity, film music theory, nineteenth-century music, musical form, and musical phenomenology and aesthetics. She is currently writing her dissertation, under the direction of Prof René Rusch, which explores connections between musical narrative and perspectives in literary theory and film theory. In particular, she is interested in examining music through the constructs of narrative space, diegetic space, and story/discourse in light of how these notions are conceptualized in both literature and film. Dorian has presented her work at national and international conferences, including Music and the Moving Image, New York (2016, 2019); the Biennial International Conference on Music Theory and Analysis, Belgrade (2019); and London Film and Media (2014). She currently serves as the technical/layout editor for <em>Music &amp; Politics</em>, and is a copy-editing Assistant for <em>Music Theory Online</em>.</p>

    <p>In light of the assertion that “narrative comprehension closely correlates with an understanding of the spatial organization of the storyworld” (Alber 2016), scholars in contemporary literary theory consider narrative space to be a vital component of narrativity. While studies in music and narrative have focused extensively on the features of plot, action, agency, narration, and temporality (e.g. Almén 2008; Cone 1974; Hatten 1991, 2018; Maus 1991; Newcomb 1992; Klein 2004), the construct of narrative space has yet to be comprehensively theorized.</p>
    <p>This paper begins to fill this gap by proposing a theoretical model of musical narrative space, one that draws parallels to how readers conceptualize fictional worlds in literature through “spatial frames,” “story spaces,” “narrative (story) worlds,” and “lived spaces” (Ryan 2009; Alber 2016). I engage with these constructs alongside an adaption of David Lewin’s (1986) p-model––a tool that captures the “phenomenological” experience of listening through a mapping of musical events perceived within multiple temporal contexts––to model the path of “musical spatial frames” encountered in Chopin’s Nocturne in F-sharp Minor, op. 48/2. Through the construct of “narrative (story) worlds,” I then conceptualize the latent musical worlds activated by a listener in the course of tracing this path. As I suggest, the process of constructing musical narrative space is largely determined by salient moments in the music that draw a listener’s attention to the “here” and “now” of listening, and it is through experiencing shifting spatial perspectives that these spaces become narrativized.</p>
