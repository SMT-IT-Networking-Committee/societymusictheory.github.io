    <p>In the Great American Songbook, sectional verse-chorus and simple chorus songs with choruses in the minor mode are far less common than those in major. Even rarer are choruses that move from minor to the relative major. Yet, Cole Porter wrote seven well-known solo numbers with this harmonic schema for seven different musicals that premiered during the height of his Broadway career between 1929 and 1954. In this paper, I interpret these songs as featuring large-scale auxiliary cadences that span the entire song form. Through analyses of individual songs, such as “So In Love” from <em>Kiss me, Kate</em> (1948) and “Get Out Of Town” from <em>Leave it to Me!</em> (1938), I demonstrate how the auxiliary cadences in these songs interact with form, motives, and lyrics to create dynamic narratives in which musical and lyrical resolution is reserved until the conclusion of each song. Moreover, I offer some closely-related voice-leading prototypes to summarize the similar harmonic and contrapuntal motion exhibited in these songs: in each prototype, the verse prolongs the major submediant (VI), and the beginning of the chorus prolongs the minor submediant (vi) before eventually moving to and confirming the tonic <em>Stufe</em> (I). Together, my analyses and prototypes build and expand upon the work of Berry (1999), Buchler (2016 and 2018), Forte (1993 and 1995), Gilbert (1995), and Shaftel (1999 and 2016), who have used Schenkerian analysis as a means to explore voice leading, counterpoint, and motives in individual songs in the Great American Songbook.</p>
