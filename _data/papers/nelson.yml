abstract: |
  <p>King James I and VI Stuart (r. 1603–25) reigned in the waning years of the
  Elizabethan Golden Age, during which he consolidated power through the Stuart
  Court and the assertion of a divine right of kings. However, one sees in three
  of William Shakespeare’s plays at the time, <i>King Lear</i> (1606),
  <i>Macbeth</i> (1606), and <i>Hamlet</i> (1609), how the body and the
  disordered mind could disrupt such sovereign power. While perhaps not direct
  critiques of King James, these plays illustrate how sovereignty was contingent
  on the body and its appetites. This paper explores the tension between James’s
  effeminacy and sexuality, and an early modern concept of rulership rooted in a
  militaristic mode of masculinity and characteristics associated with men in
  early modern England, namely, rationality and the control of the body. This
  paper illustrates that tension by looking at class and mental disorder in
  <i>King Lear</i>, satirical poems about the King such as <i>Stuart Libels</i>,
  and his role in the plot of the Stuart Court masque <i>Hymenaei</i> (1606). By
  studying the case of King James, one sees the broader struggle of a pre-modern
  ruler attempting to consolidate power while failing to capture the popularity
  of his predecessor, Queen Elizabeth I. This study also highlights the
  fragility inherent to a mode of sovereignty that would dominate England and
  France well into the eighteenth century. King James I provides a case where
  mental and physical disorder, sexuality and gender, and rulership in the
  emerging modern state collide. Though all rulers inevitably receive criticism
  or mockery in popular media such as street literature and broadside poems, the
  criticism of King James reveals the fractious nature of early modern
  kingship.</p>
