        <p>The Power of Collective Bargaining:</p>
        <p>Fighting for Class Equality and Livable Working Conditions for Graduate Students in the Performing Arts</p>
        <p>Graduate students face a long and difficult path to stable employment, but this path need not include living in poverty, insecurity, and fear. Unfortunately, unstable power dynamics and issues of diversity and inclusion continue to underlie and underscore compliance with this narrative of suffering. Through the lenses of racial and class inequality, tropes about low wages, starvation, and doubts about the value of students and their work are seen to strike a painful chord for many—especially those disproportionately affected by the strains of higher education.</p>
        <p>In this talk, I seek to illuminate these issues by sharing my experience as a union organizer at the University of Michigan, focusing on the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO) strike for a safe and just pandemic response and an ongoing campaign toward equitable pay for graduate employees at the School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance (SMTD). I detail the fight for parity at SMTD, describing past conversations with administration, recent attempts to alter GEO contract language, and plans to continue to pursue equality for performing artists. Finally, I consider the unjust power dynamic causing the mistreatment of contingent employees by describing our strike demands and the obstacles encountered while seeking a safe environment for teaching, learning, and growing.</p>
        <p>My work with GEO has taught me valuable lessons about allyship and intersections of race, ethnicity, and class in academia, and that many of the issues facing academics today can be distilled into one simple truth: the risks of pursuing a terminal degree vary greatly based on personal identity.</p>
