    <p>Despite being a prolific composer, Cecil Taylor was notoriously averse to notation. In his essay, “Sound Structure of Subculture Becoming Major Breath/Naked Fire Gesture,” Taylor insists that “Western notation blocks total absorption in the ‘action’ playing.” This notion of “‘action’ playing” is key to understanding Taylor’s music: for Taylor, sound does not precede movement; rather, movement precedes sound. This paper analyzes Taylor’s work on his own terms, using contour theory as a bridge from notation-based to embodiment-centric approaches to analysis. I will use my own transcriptions of Taylor’s solo piano music to show how his compositions and improvisations are easily divisible into cells of notes, which obey a strict set of invented rules concerning repetition, transposition, and right-to-left-hand mapping. I will then show how these cells may be taxonomized using a surprisingly limited set of contour segments (CSEGs). Finally, I will demonstrate how these cells reveal the mechanisms through which Taylor’s highly kinetic performances are made possible: CSEGs translate directly into piano fingerings, and the shapes and variations of his cells conform effortlessly to the physiology of the hand. Understanding Taylor’s music less as notation, but more as the organization of physical gestures, not only suggests a new approach to analyzing free jazz, but also provides insight into how the complex intertwining of sound and movement affects the process of improvisation as a whole.</p>
