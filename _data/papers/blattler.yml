  <p>This paper discusses Ravel’s subversion of the conventional pairing of
  stable tonality with relatively symmetrical phrase rhythm and of unstable
  tonal areas with relatively asymmetrical phrase rhythm. In Ravel’s output,
  surprising, irregular phrase rhythm at moments of tonal/thematic return is
  found in À la manière de . . . Chabrier, the <i>Menuet sur le nom d’Haydn</i>,
  pieces from <i>Le Tombeau de Couperin</i>, and the last of the <i>Valses
  nobles et sentimentales</i>. These pieces all reference departed people or
  things: past masters, friends killed in the Great War, or, in the case of the
  <i>Valses nobles</i>, a lost imperial grandeur, waltzes by Schubert, Robert
  Schumann, and Johann Strauss Jr., and, via quotation, several of the set’s
  previous waltzes. This suggests the technique—the evaporation of something at
  exactly the point it is most desired/expected—can be read as a gesture about
  loss. This paper concludes by importing that sense of loss into a reading of
  the “Blues” movement from the 1927 Violin Sonata. This movement’s delicately
  balanced phrase rhythm collapses upon the resolution of the piece’s bitonal
  tension; recognition of this phrase-rhythmic technique allows one to read in
  it a <i>pittoresque</i> wistfulness found in other of Ravel’s exoticist works.
  An analytic look at this understudied aspect of Ravel’s output, then, enhances
  our understanding of his art and can teach us to hear phrase rhythm as bearing
  hermeneutic freight.</p>
