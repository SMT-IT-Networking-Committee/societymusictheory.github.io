abstract: |
    <p>The first movements of Milhaud’s Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Clarinet and
    Piano, Ravel’s Sonata for Violin and Piano, and Martinů’s Sextet for Winds
    and Piano are in sonata form with truncated recapitulation, that is, they
    begin with normative sonata expositions but their recapitulations do not
    produce the secondary theme. This violates the most basic norm of sonata
    form, but whereas this would register as a catastrophic deformation in a
    19th-century work, these three Parisian-modernist pieces are not
    cataclysmic in affect and all blithely end in the major mode.</p>
    <p>This paper demonstrates that these pieces feature goal-directed
    processes, running in parallel to sonata-form logic, which complete with
    the reprise of the first theme; the resultant sense of resolution allows
    the remaining sonata-form exigencies to be discarded. In the Ravel, the
    process is a macroharmonic one, wherein the first theme returns without
    the octatonicism that suffused the exposition. In the Milhaud, the primary
    theme is reprised without the bitonal clash that marked its initial
    appearance. In the Martinů, the process is an accumulative one, wherein
    signifiers of a jazz style are slowly introduced until they accrete into a
    concentrated evocation of jazz. This novel approach to sonata form
    spotlights the Parisian-modernist interest in “neoclassical” formal
    traditions and the ironic distance with which those traditions could be
    treated; it also forms an intriguing parallel with modernist notions of
    counterpoint between the arts in multimedia works, and enriches both
    theories of form and conceptions of the musical work as the intersection
    of independent compositional parameters.</p>
