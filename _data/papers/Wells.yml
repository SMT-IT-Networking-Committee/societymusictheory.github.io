    <p>While Franz Liszt’s progressive harmonic, formal, and thematic principles have received great scholarly attention, explorations of his idiosyncratic rhythmic/metric language have been relatively few. The metrically jarring opening to <em>Totentanz</em> and curious uses of hypermeter in <em>Mephisto Waltz No. 1</em>, however, suggest that Liszt’s metric language warrants deeper exploration. Specifically, in both pieces, initial metric tensions are but the start of a larger metric narrative involving cycles of heard downbeats against an underlying notated meter/hypermeter. As such, in the current presentation, I investigate how cycles of shifting heard “downbeats” shape <em>Totentanz</em> and the <em>Mephisto Waltzes</em> locally and globally. </p>
    <p>To accomplish these goals, I will expand upon Ng’s (2005; 2006) “hemiolic cycle,” which models leftward-shifting heard “downbeats” in triple meter. Because Liszt’s metric cycles are not limited to triple meter, I will generalize Ng’s hemiolic cycle using Wells’s (2017) <em>GIS<sub>B</sub></em>, a Lewinian generalized interval system that measures transformations within an idealized notated measure. The resulting “positive/negative <em>n</em>-cycles,” where <em>n</em> is the notated meter, will form a backdrop for analyses of these fiery Liszt works. In short, a positive/negative <em>n</em>-cycle is a progressive shift of the apparent “downbeat” by ±1 beat with respect to the notated measure. Through cycle-based analyses of <em>Totentanz</em> and <em>Mephisto Waltzes 1-4</em>, this presentation will provide new metric insights into Liszt’s virtuosic writing while providing new tools for metric analysis writ large.</p>
