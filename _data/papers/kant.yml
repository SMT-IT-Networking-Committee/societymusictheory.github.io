title: "Measuring Infinity: Digitizing David Dunn’s <i>Thresholds and Fragile States</i>"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Composer David Dunn’s 2010 piece <i>Thresholds and Fragile States</i> is a
  network of analog circuitry designed to generate an endless and constantly
  evolving variety of musical sound. Like many electronic works in the American
  experimental tradition, the music is difficult to analyze because
  compositional decisions are embedded within layers of circuit design and
  musical features are explained at the level of individual electrical
  components. In this paper, I present an analysis of Dunn’s piece using tools
  from circuit analysis, digital modeling, and dynamical systems theory. </p>
  <p>Motivated by his experience listening to the patterns of insects on a swamp
  in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana in addition to his study of cybernetics,
  Dunn attempts in this piece to mimic, through electronic circuitry, the
  natural structure of biological systems. In my analysis, I clarify Dunn’s
  concepts of emergence and autonomy by examining how they are instantiated in
  circuitry, addressing the compositional decisions involved in network design
  and the musical implications of those decisions. I discuss the scope of the
  emergent music and map out the ranges of network parameter settings that
  produces it. I find that endless variety of constantly evolving music is the
  result of hysteresis, or time lag, of the vactrol, a circuit component and
  common “hack” in electronic music. Furthermore, I find that this variety
  occurs within a small region of carefully tuned network settings that the
  composer discovered empirically through musical performance.</p>
  <p>This work is based on a software model of Dunn’s circuitry, as well as
  Dunn’s published writings, personal and published interviews, score diagrams,
  schematics, and measurements of Dunn’s circuitry. I draw from systems theory
  and cybernetics, as well as the work of scholars such as musicologist You
  Nakai, electronic music historian Joel Chadabe, and historian of cybernetics
  Andrew Pickering. In this paper I forward an analytic language and tools for
  describing the kinds of infinity produced by complex and chaotic sound
  circuitry, which has the potential to shed light on the work of other
  electronic music composers, such as David Tudor, Bebe and Louis Barron, and
  members of the Sonic Arts Union.</p>
