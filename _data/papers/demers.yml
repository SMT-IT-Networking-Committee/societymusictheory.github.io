abstract: |
    <p>In a 1983 <i>Artforum </i>essay on New York art-rock, Kim Gordon of
    Sonic Youth writes, “People pay to see others believe in themselves.”
    Greil Marcus' punk history <i>Lipstick Traces </i>(1989) cites this
    statement to valorize punk musicians who dare what the rest of us only
    imagine. But a later sentence in Gordon's essay asks, “How long can
    someone continue to exert intensity before it becomes mannered and
    dishonest?” In fact, Gordon's essay plainly argues that punks perform
    belief in themselves as entertainment, and yet act as if their performance
    is not theater. And the audience performs its belief in that spectacle,
    acting as if the show provided true catharsis. The “as ifs” are crucial,
    for they reveal fault-lines separating belief from what Žižek (1989) terms
    “fetishistic disavowal.”  For Gordon, the tragedy of punk rock is that the
    disjunction between sincere belief and disavowed belief becomes too
    demanding—too real—to maintain.</p>

    <p>My paper argues that such instances of fetishistic disavowal in music
    are often misdiagnosed.  Traditional music aesthetics (Cook 1990; Hamilton
    2007; Scruton 1997) and legal studies (Fuller 1997) rationalize such
    disavowals as utilitarian metaphors offered for the sake of argument, but
    never actually believed.  But a psychoanalytic approach illuminates the
    ambivalence that is central to the musical experience.  Moments of
    disavowal in music can serve a role analogous to that of the chorus of an
    ancient Greek tragedy, which, Lacan (1992) argues, believes the requisite
    fantasies for us.</p>
