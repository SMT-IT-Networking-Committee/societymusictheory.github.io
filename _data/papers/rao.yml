    <p>There are many compelling reasons to be inclusive and to diversify the
    composers we study in classrooms. Significant efforts have been made in
    recent years by scholars to broaden the repertoire that we consider either
    as textbook music examples or as pieces for close analysis in scholarly
    works.  The broadening of the “canon” has been such a collective effort
    that we have begun to see the effects in textbooks, dissertation topics,
    conference papers and scholarly journals. As we continue the endeavor to
    diversify the composers we study by gender, sexuality, genre, nationality,
    culture, race, etc., this paper suggests that we can also consider this as
    an opportunity to achieve profound results from another angle. Theory and
    analysis as a field of study could be broadened by cultivating analytical
    approaches that are germane to the aesthetic and musical practices of
    works by diverse composers. This paper considers two such examples: how
    the notion of timbre and the notion of temporality could be complicated by
    analyzing music by Ruth Crawford and Tan Dun. It will be argued that
    incorporating works by diverse composers not only broadens the scope or
    diversifies the repertoire we study, it also opens up new theoretical
    inquiries and identifies and defines musical parameters in a fresh
    light—perspectives that are just as important but have heretofore received
    little attention in the general field of music theory. In other words, it
    helps us diversify and redefine what can be considered as valid and
    valuable modes of analysis.</p>
