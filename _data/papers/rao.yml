    <p>The notion of “Shi” is an aesthetic essence deeply ingrained in Chinese
    culture, and ubiquitous in descriptions of calligraphy, music and painting
    all through Chinese history. In treatises on the performance of guqin
    since Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), for example, “Shi” is frequently evoked
    as a shaping force in performance. Though a multifaceted notion, “Shi”
    pertains particularly to a sense of temporality. Whereas in Western music,
    the notion of temporality, especially the term “rhythm,” brings up
    concepts of meter, accent, subdivision, duration, all of which are
    quantifiable, in Chinese music the notion of “Shi” denotes a sense of
    temporality that is gestural and “task-oriented” (Clayton 2013), thus
    indivisible and unquantifiable. It shapes the temporal process of musical
    event. While shaping sound through time, “Shi” cannot be measured by
    clock-time. Rather, the potential, the energy, and the disposition of
    “Shi” make it similar to “gesture,” in the sense that is defined by Robert
    Hatten (2004). Similar to Hatten’s notion of gesture, “Shi” emphasizes the
    dynamism produced, and the tension that animates various elements in the
    temporal process. Emanating from “Shi” is an internal energy that gives
    rise to a temporal process delineated by the timbre and the full dynamic
    shape, rather than the pulse or meter.</p>

    <p>The paper will focus on the effect of “Shi” as an organizing force of
    Chen Yi’s <i>Happy Rain on A Spring Night</i> (2004), and will offer a
    reading of the work by considering the disposition and energy of gestural
    events. The piece, using the Pierrot ensemble, is based on a poem by Du Fu
    (Tang Dynasty, 712-770). Though the work’s structure follows the principle
    of Golden Section strictly, the paper will consider the organizing force
    of “Shi,” and the different ways that gestures play an important role in
    its aesthetic appeal, and its rendition of the spirit of the poem.</p>
