abstract: |
  <p>Charles Seeger’s <i>Tradition and Experiment in the New Music </i>is known
  to reflect his contribution of theoretical ideas to American ultramodern
  music. It was written between 1929 and 1931 when Ruth Crawford studied
  composition with him. My work argues that Crawford is the co-author of this
  theoretical treatise. During the crucial period the student/teacher
  partnership generated its core inquiry. I study various sketches and versions
  of Seeger’s treatise, tracing the shifting focus on selected
  theoretical/compositional issues that emerged at different stages of its
  development. The treatise is treated not as a self-contained compositional
  theory but rather as a thinking and working process in which the focus was
  significantly modified over the period encompassing Crawford’s involvement.  I
  maintain that Crawford’s talent as a composer, as well as the direction that
  her musical composition took, shaped many of the theoretical ideas.</p>
  <p>That the shift in focus of Seeger’s theory treatise occurred at different
  stages during the period of Crawford’s study with him attests to both her
  influence and the entwined partnership. Seeger’s treatise records the process
  of discovery and adaptations of new ideas, the transformation of theoretical
  principles into pragmatic compositional techniques, and a philosophical
  justification and theorization of compositional practices.</p>
