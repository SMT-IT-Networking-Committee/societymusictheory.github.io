abstract: |
  <p>Ticket lists and written accounts show that concert halls and dance
  venues in late-eighteenth-century Vienna shared largely the same clientele.
  Just as the paying public moved fluidly between the city’s concert halls and
  dance venues, so did minuet compositions. Symphonic minuets frequently found
  their way into the dance hall, and minuets composed originally for dancing
  were often subsequently used in domestic concerts. The re-purposing of minuets
  for different venues entailed significant alterations to the music, beyond
  changes in instrumentation. It often involved significant re-composition, to
  alter the phrase lengths. These arrangements offer a compelling window into
  eighteenth-century Viennese dance culture: compositional changes made to equip
  them for new venues tell us about the practices and choreographies that the
  music sought to accommodate.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I examine arrangements of two minuets by Haydn. The first is
  of the minuet from Symphony no. 91, in which the instrumentation is reduced,
  the music is transposed to a new key, and phrase lengths are cut. The second
  is of a minuet first written for the Gesellschaft bildender Künstler’s 1792
  ball, and subsequently arranged for string trio, whose phrase lengths have
  also been cut. I consider the venues at which these arrangements were
  employed, and examine minuet choreographies that might have been performed
  there. I also consider prescriptions from eighteenth-century theorists
  Heinrich Christoph Koch and Johann Kirnberger concerning the
  <i>Achttaktigkeit</i> (“eight-barred-ness”) of danced minuet compositions.
  Picking up a question raised in 1982 by Günter Thomas (in possibly the only
  article to have considered these arrangements), I propose that the phrase
  lengths have been altered to enable a certain style of minuet choreography
  employed at the venues in question. In exploring the different iterations that
  a single minuet composition might take—symphonic movement for a concert
  audience, string trio for dancers, harpsichord piece for domestic playing—I
  paint a clearer picture of the ways in which audiences encountered the minuet.
  More broadly, I argue that we need to appreciate the importance of
  arrangements in eighteenth-century musical life, and that arrangements were
  not considered poor relations of their originals in contemporaneous
  discourse.</p>
