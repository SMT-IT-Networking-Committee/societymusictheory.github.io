    <p>Many of the short piano works written in the last decades of the 19th
    century are constructed as ternary forms (ABA'). This paper accounts for
    processes of transfer and compensation among ternary sections, such as
    when B materials infiltrate A′ sections or when A' sections “solve” a
    musical “problem” shared by both A and B materials. Using analytical
    vignettes drawn from Brahms, I illustrate the tension between unity of
    expression and contrast in the relationships among different sections,
    building on the research of McClelland 2009, Scott 1995, and Cadwallader
    1988. To do this, I develop two paradigms of balance in the final sections
    of short ternary pieces: <i>unifying returns</i> and <i>compensatory
    returns</i>. Unifying returns combine A and B materials within the A'
    section. For example, in Op. 119/I the A' prime section integrates the
    descending fifth progressions expressed through chains of thirds of its A
    section with the chromatic melodic linkages of its B section. Compensatory
    returns do not feature such unification of materials. Instead, some other
    effect of balance is made in the A' section. For example, in the final
    measures of Op. 117/I, a deceptive resolution to a root-position
    subdominant compensates for the lack of that harmony throughout the rest
    of the composition. Through analytical examples such as these, I develop
    the features of my two paradigms. The result is a language that can help
    reorient us toward such subtle effects and may enrich our analysis of
    music of other genres, styles, and periods.</p>
