    <p>This paper explores questions of genius through the works of contemporary nun composers, examining characterizations of their music as “professional” or “amateur.” I contend nuns’ religious profession and depictions of their music making as divinely inspired positions their contemporary compositions as amateur and lacking divine inspiration.</p>
    <p>Though highly feminized in media depictions of chanting and “hum-and-strum” folk singing, nuns represent a cultural outgroup that occupies non-binary spaces while simultaneously subjugated by religious institutions. Nuns are presented as Platonic geniuses—vessels of divine musical inspiration—as far back as Hildegard’s visitations, while chapel designs obliged nuns to perform unseen until 1960 and excluded them from professional musical exchanges until 1965.</p>
    <p>Three interlocking factors buttress perceptions of contemporary nun composers as unsophisticated and uninspired, despite their education and stylistic diversity: First, Vatican II reforms made professional (male) composers Beethovenian guardians of traditional forms, just as nuns gained access to advanced degrees and public performances. Second, media commodification and feminization of American religious life in the 1960s placed nuns’ music into a gendered “amateur” category. Third, nuns’ religiosity and traditionalism strongly contrasted with second-wave feminism, excluding them from definitions of genius encompassing modernist female composers.</p>
    <p>Sr. Theophane Hytrek, Sr. Miriam Therese Winter, and Elise, CHS serve as case studies, spanning genres from chant to feminist songs to symphonies. Analyzing these works not only acquaints us with this repertoire, but also shows how attitudes about compositional genius continue to affect nuns’ musical reception, much to the detriment of both feminist and music scholarship.</p>
