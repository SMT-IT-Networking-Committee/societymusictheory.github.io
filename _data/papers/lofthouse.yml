abstract: |
  <p>Discovering the music of Charles Ives as a teen, film composer Bernard
  Herrmann became an enthusiastic devotee; in contrast to what he viewed as the
  “mystical incantations” of Schoenberg and “artificial, neo-classic rules” of
  Stravinsky, Herrmann embraced Ives’s eclectic modernism, which he viewed as
  the product of “observation of town and country.” Whereas scholars have noted
  various <i>ad hoc</i> aspects of Ives’s influence on Herrmann’s scores,
  including tonal language in 1951’s <i>The Day The Earth Stood Still</i>
  (Leydon) and polystylism and polyrhythms in 1958’s <i>Vertigo</i> (Cooper,
  Blim, Brown, and Sullivan, among others), little attention has been given to
  how Herrmann’s scores in general, and <i>Vertigo</i> in particular, explicitly
  reflect engagement with Ives’s systematic modernist compositional approaches
  to create cohesion and structural direction via extra-contextual gestural
  means. </p>
  <p>This talk will focus on several of these modernist techniques in
  <i>Vertigo</i>, including Herrmann’s use of: (1) melodic wedge shapes, which
  tend to center around an opening dyad or semitone figure, with leaps above and
  below this dyad returning to the pitch-space center; (2) palindromes in his
  motivic and ostinato cells, an Ivesian technique coined by Philip Lambert as
  “event palindromes”; and (3) interval cycles and the juxtaposition of triads
  at the semitone. That these more systematic elements of Ives’s modernist
  approaches permeate Herrmann’s score for <i>Vertigo</i> is perhaps no
  surprise, given his championing of both Ives and modernism.</p>
