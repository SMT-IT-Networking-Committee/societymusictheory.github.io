abstract: |
    <p>In France, after the First World War, sonata-form structures of the
    18th century were revived and reimagined within the context of
    neoclassicism. A new neoclassical sonata form was born: a structure
    designed to crumble and fail. This paper explores French sonata-form
    movements of the 1920s as structures of ruin—movements that not only pay
    homage to the sonata forms of the past, but also bear the scars left by
    the passage of time.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate neoclassical French sonata form, I examine the
    large-scale form of the first movement of three representative
    neoclassical works: Milhaud’s Sonatine for Flute (1922), Poulenc’s Trio
    for Oboe, Bassoon and Piano (1926), and Ravel’s Sonata for Violin No. 2
    (1923–27). My approach is based on Caplin’s form-functional theory
    (1998) but, because of the post-tonal nature of the pieces, I apply
    form-functional principles to melody in order to determine beginning,
    middle, and ending functions.</p>
    <p>My analyses reveal that neoclassical sonata form is deformational
    (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006). “Failures” of formal structure are actually
    moments of expressive power. In these works, the clarity of formal
    functions, the boundaries of thematic areas, and the order of the thematic
    material disintegrates once a sonata-form structure has been suggested. By
    the onset of the recapitulation, each movement has already fallen into
    ruin: formal units are missing; themes are compressed; and new material
    outside of the sonata form appears. Ultimately, the beauty of neoclassical
    sonata form lies in its crumbling structure: a structure that
    simultaneously acknowledges the past and the present.</p>
