    <p>When dealing with the difficult issue of determining when and where
    partimenti came into use, I conjectured about a Roman origin. That was an
    elegant solution: in the early years of the eighteenth century, Rome was
    probably the most advanced musical center in Europe, and the earliest signed
    partimenti manuscript collection, that by Bernardo Pasquini, originated here
    about 1707. A migration to Naples occurred later, following Alessandro
    Scarlatti’s move from Rome to Naples.</p> 

    <p>As it turned out later, after my book <i>The Art of Partimento</i> came
    out, things seem to be more complicated. Newly discovered sources, such as
    the <i>Regole o vero Toccate di studio del Sig. Abb[at]e Fran[cesc]o
    Mancini 1695 </i>(F-Pn Rés. 2315) prove that partimenti were in use in
    Naples already at the end of the seventeenth century, and possibly
    earlier. In fact, the Mancini manuscript, and in particular the 21 Toccate
    for harpsichord, betray an impressive level of sophistication and
    virtuosity, which would be unlikely to have been reached in a short time.
    Other manuscripts, such as the coeval Rocco Greco manuscript (I-Nc 33.2.3)
    show that bass string majors studied partimenti at the keyboard, but also
    learned how to <i>harmonically</i> improvise diminutions on standard bass
    patterns on their instruments. Thus, musicological research helps us to
    better understand the origins of the practice, but also to find a solution
    for the problem we face today when teaching partimenti to non-keyboard
    majors.</p>
