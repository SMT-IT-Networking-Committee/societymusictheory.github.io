    <p>The study of voice-leading among pitch sets and pitch-class sets has
    been a prominent topic of music theory in the past twenty years. A variety
    of approaches, focused on harmonic similarity, transformational networks,
    or parsimonious voice-leading, have more recently been subsumed under a
    geometrical model based on a mapping of pitch or pc sets onto dimensional
    coordinates using the semitone as a metric. These developments have led to
    some early attempts to establish a general typology of voice-leading
    <i>sets </i>(vlset)<i> </i>and voice-leading <i>classes </i>(vlclass), as
    a higher-level analog to the pc-set and set-class typologies.</p>

    <p>My paper examines vlsets and vlclasses from a purposely narrowed
    perspective, limited to instances<i> </i>of <i>Maximally-Smooth </i>(MS)
    voice leading—i.e., wherein motion between pcs is limited to one semitone.
    I show that there exist, for each cardinality, only a relatively limited
    number of MS-vlsets, and an even smaller number of MS-vlclasses. Focusing
    initially on pcsets and set-classes of cardinality two and three
    (including multisets), I examine the properties MS- vlsets and vlclasses,
    corresponding to various types of relations (T/I, K-net isographies,
    constant sums), and explore the various geometrical features of the
    resulting voice-leading spaces. I then extend these observations to other
    cardinalities, and conclude with suggestions for a unified, systematic
    typology of MS-vlsets and vlclasses for all cardinalities.</p>
