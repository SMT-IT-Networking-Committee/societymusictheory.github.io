abstract: |
  <p>Nivelles, a double monastery in the medieval diocese of Liège, was founded
  in the seventh century. The earliest vita of its patron saint Gertrude, written
  by a monk who knew her, establishes the patrimony of the Pippinids, proving
  that the region around Nivelles was the original seat of Charlemagne’s family.
  Zurich, Zentralbibliothek, Rheinau 30, a late-eighth-century source for the
  Gregorian mass propers, was copied from a Nivellese exemplar, and already has
  two Gertrude feasts in its calendar. Until the present time there has been no
  evidence for the study of the chant and liturgy from this ancient and
  prestigious establishment: the origins of Gertrude’s office for her major feast
  on 17 March and its contents in Nivelles itself have remained unknown, although
  there are late medieval witnesses to the texts and music of the feast
  elsewhere.</p>
  <p>In the last decade, a previously unstudied mid-fourteenth-century ordinal
  outlining the liturgical practice of the Abbey of Nivelles, with details about
  the chant and its performance, was acquired by Harvard University (Houghton
  Library MS Lat. 422). This ordinal contains a liturgical practice as
  established in Nivelles in the late thirteenth century, and so is the earliest
  known witness to the Gertrude office. A cache of seventeenth- and
  eighteenth-century manuscripts from Nivelles now found in the Royal Library in
  Brussels, contain both texts and music, for the 17 March feast, and these can
  now be proven to represent the medieval office. The ordinal also contains
  incipits for a second previously unknown Gertrude office: responsories for it
  can now also be recovered from the Brussels sources. Comparison of the two
  Gertrude offices reveals that, even though they co-existed in the liturgy, and
  even though elements from them were combined for processions on major feast
  days, they are quite different in character. In what is doubtless the earlier
  of the offices, Itta, Gertrude’s mother, plays a major role in the founding of
  the Abbey of Nivelles. In the later office, Itta’s actions have been
  transferred to Gertrude herself, and a new historical understanding has been
  created, one related to political circumstances.</p>
