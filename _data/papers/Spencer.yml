    <p>Throughout the Jesus and Mary Chain’s <em>Pyschocandy</em> (1985), impenetrable walls of distortion, abrasive feedback squeals, and excessive uses of reverb seem to thwart listeners’ attempts to mentally represent a “virtual performance space” (Moore 2012). Instead, the album encourages an acousmatic orientation by which sounds are heard as disembodied or somehow “floating free” of their worldly causes. Taking this apparent rupture of sound and source as a jumping-off point, this paper investigates the perception of texture in rock through close analysis of three representative tracks from <em>Psychocandy</em>: “Just Like Honey,” “Never Understand,” and “You Trip Me Up.” Supporting my observations with spectrograms and audio feature analysis, I confront existing approaches to texture, such as “accumulative form” (Spicer 2004), the “sound box” (Moore 2012), and “functional layer” analysis (Moore 2012, Lavengood 2020), emphasizing how these approaches are both productive and problematic for the analysis of texture in <em>Psychocandy.</em> I conclude by considering some larger questions about perceptual uncertainty and its role in the aesthetic appreciation of recorded experimental rock music.</p>
