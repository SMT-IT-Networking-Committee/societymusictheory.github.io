title: "Rapping to a different beat: Flow, language, and aesthetics in triplet, non-duple, and irregular hip-hop tracks"

abstract: |
  <p>Rap is overwhelmingly in 4/4; most rappers imagine a four-beat,
  sixteen-pulse line of verse (Edwards). Nonetheless, rap tracks in 3/4, 12/8,
  5/4, and changing meters do exist, as do loops with an odd number of measures.
  However, the analytical literature has focused almost entirely on rap in 4/4
  (e.g., Krims, Adams). </p>
  <p>These unusual configurations present an interesting case study on which
  aesthetic values rappers prioritize—sound vs. intelligibility, rhyme vs.
  stress. This paper investigates flow aesthetics in non-duple divisions,
  meters, or phrases, building on ideas about linguistic and musical accents
  (Patel, London, Lerdahl and Jackendoff). </p>
  <p>In trap, triplets are rapped continuously with syllables in equal duration.
  This presents challenges in English, which has alternating stresses marked by
  duration. Furthermore, the first triplet or sextuplet is normally accented,
  prescribing word choices. In “DNA,” Kendrick Lamar initially raps each measure
  as four sets of triplets, then capitalizes on the words’ trochaic rhythm to
  transition into a sextuplet pattern; the mood changes, with the sextuplets
  reflecting the swirl of his affluent lifestyle. In contrast, continuous
  triplets are natural in Japanese, where each mora is spoken with similar
  duration. </p>
  <p>Additive or changing meters challenge rappers to align rhyme schemes. In
  “Story 2,”which adds a beat to the meter every ten seconds, Daveed Diggs
  adjusts his flow to regularize rhyme placement within each metrical context.
  In loops with odd numbers of measures, rappers shape rhyme schemes to fit the
  loop. </p>
  <p>Rappers thus prioritize stress and rhyme placement in unusual rhythms,
  meters, and phrase lengths.</p>
