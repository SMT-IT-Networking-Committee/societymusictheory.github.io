  <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, philosophy as a discipline stood at a
  precipice. A new science—psychology—redefined philosophical questions of
  meaning by taking account of empirical evidence in the brain: were ideas now
  reducible to material causes? In response to the crisis, Edmund Husserl’s
  <i>Logische Untersuchungen </i>(1900/1901)<i> </i>proposed a
  <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i> that would investigate the relations between the
  natural laws of empirical psychology and the formal laws of logic: this
  “science of science” he termed, “phenomenology.”</p>
  <p>After the turn of the twenty-first century, music analysis finds itself
  similarly challenged; the domain of music analysis seems to be ceded to a new
  science—music cognition—that promises to offer an empirical account of musical
  meaning. Thus, the aim of my presentation is to explore the applicability of
  classical Husserlian phenomenology to our present situation in music analysis.
  Drawing upon the third logical investigation of the <i>Logische
  Untersuchungen</i>—on mereology, or the study of parts and wholes—I examine
  what Husserl terms the “logical laws” of independent and non-independent
  parts, focusing specifically upon “extensional wholes.” I apply this framework
  to an analysis of Husserl’s <i>Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins
  (1893–1917)</i>. Developing Husserl’s themes, I make two claims: </p>
  <p>1. that musical meaning unfolds through the flowing “parts” of time (e.g.,
  retention, original impression, and protention) that together constitute what
  Husserl terms <i>transcendental subjectivity</i>; and</p>
  <p>2. that the relation of these parts of time form an extensional whole that
  operates according to objective laws of logic. </p>
