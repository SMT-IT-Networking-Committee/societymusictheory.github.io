    <p>This paper explores the notion of <em>interpretive difficulty</em> in contemporary music, treating it as a structural, tangible aspect of music analysis. Interpretive difficulty comprises any challenge a performer may encounter in their practice—physical, cognitive, emotional; specific to a musical passage, or generalized across a repertoire, genre, or idiom. Inspired by Daphne Leong’s collaborative research on analysis and performance in twentieth-century music (2019), I interview professional musicians about their experiences learning and performing works such as <em>Crimson</em> (Rebecca Saunders, 2005), <em>Taurangi</em> (Gillian Whitehead 1999), and <em>Mani.Δίκη</em> (Pierluigi Billone 2012), focusing on how interpretive difficulty and musical structure intersect in their practice. While several interviews are hardly sufficient to theorize broadly on the relationship between interpretive difficulty and musical structure, the musicians’ comments suggest that this relationship manifests along several axes: accuracy, latitude (choice), narrative, and control. </p>
    <p>Interpretive difficulty is uniquely determined by any musician’s context: physical, cognitive, environmental, musical, or cultural. Despite this individuality, construing difficulty along the aforementioned axes establishes relationships between works, performers, and instrumental idioms that might otherwise have little in common—a particularly appealing prospect for recently composed repertoire, for which few comprehensive analytical strategies exist. My work subscribes to Nicholas Cook’s (2013) redefinition of the score from an immutable “text” to a “script” that is interpreted, supplemented, and molded in performance. This redefinition creates space to integrate performance issues into the analytical process and encourages the treatment of performer agency as a fundamental object of analysis. </p>
