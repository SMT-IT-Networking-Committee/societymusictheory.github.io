abstract: |
  <p>This paper examines the unusual challenges associated with accurately
  realizing Partch’s music for performance or analysis. Such issues range from
  the obvious matters of deciphering his tablature and interpreting his
  shorthand comments to the more obscure including the poorly, if at all,
  documented changes in tuning schemes and notational paradigms of some
  instruments, the frequent discrepancies between prefatory notes and markings
  in the body of the score, and the question of whether differences between
  otherwise identical copies of a particular work are the result of deliberate
  revision or unintentional omission. This paper also discusses Partch’s
  conception of harmony, harmonic progression, and the qualities of melodic
  intervals, focusing primarily on how these elements lead to a more informed
  performance and more meaningful analysis.</p>
