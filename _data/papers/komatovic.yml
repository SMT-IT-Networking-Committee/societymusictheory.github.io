abstract: |
    <p>The Second World War and the subsequent change in the socio-political structure of Yugoslavia profoundly impacted the cultural policy of the region. The new communist government imposed the aesthetics of socialist realism per USSR’s 1930s doctrine. However, following Yugoslavia’s break from the Eastern Block in 1948, certain avant-garde elements were somewhat tolerated. Ljubica Marić (1909–2003), the first Serbian formally-trained woman composer in the country, was one of the key figures in this post-war Serbian avant-garde music scene, navigating through a complex political and patriarchal system.</p>
    <p>Unable to find a steady position, she completely withdrew from the publicity, commenced experimenting with religious mysticism and studied Byzantine music theory, especially the <em>Ochtoechos—a</em> medieval Christian Orthodox Church scalar system. These discoveries of music structures led her to develop new aesthetics and compositional techniques, resulting to the creation of some of the most important compositions in the Serbian modernism.</p>
    <p>In this study, I will try to answer this question—how did Marić obtain a comparative advantage against her male colleagues, and why is she today considered to be one of the most successful Serbian composers of all the time?</p>
    <p>Through my analysis of her key avant-garde compositions, I will explain how Marić’s combination of archaic and avant-garde music expression not only created a new modernist aesthetic, but also paved the way for new generations of composers, and especially women, who today remarkably make the majority of composers in Serbia.</p>
