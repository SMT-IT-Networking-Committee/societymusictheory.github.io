abstract: |
    <p>A prevalent axiom of sound studies is the notion that the technological
    reproduction of sound has a claim to materiality that the ears do not. The
    propensity of sound studies scholars to focus on sound technologies is
    tied to an archival orientation towards the 20th century, as well as a
    turn toward materiality that is part of a larger backlash against the
    linguistic turn, the study of representation, and traditional conceptions
    of hermeneutics grounded in textuality. The adage that technological
    reproductions of sound render it more “thing like” ignores historicized
    concepts of sound as entangled with aesthetics and physiology, furnishing
    a technological authority over the real, and granting primacy to the
    technological reproduction of sound in the modern age.</p>

    <p>This paper argues that the psychoanalytic technique itself is a
    technology of sound, asking in what ways does the practice of
    psychoanalysis, the speaking and listening that constitutes the method,
    depend on sound as part of the empirical world. I consider Freud’s famous
    comparison of the psychoanalytic method to a telephone, with the
    unconscious minds of analyst and analysand operating as transducers of the
    speech that constitutes the practice. I suggest that if we approach
    psychoanalysis as an instrument that can be understood both as a
    verification of subjective interior—via the speech that constitutes the
    method—and one of subjective imagination—via the fantasies that are
    spoken—we can use it as a means of dissolving the distinction between the
    material ear and its counterpart of music, sound, or speech.</p>
