abstract: |
  <p>Issues of race, gender, and sexuality are rare topics of discourse among
  new music communities that operate between hubs of commercial and academic
  activity in Europe and the US Calling out racism and sexism, or even drawing
  attention to the overwhelming whiteness and maleness of the field remains
  controversial. In addition, there is an overwhelming lack of criticism of
  compositions from perspectives of race, gender, and sexuality, even when the
  pieces themselves directly associate themselves with such issues.</p>
  <p>This paper explores the critical reception of three recent works that deal
  explicitly with race: <i>Amistad</i>, by Anthony Davis explores the middle
  passage from the perspective of the ocean; <i>American Lulu</i> by Olga
  Neuwirth revises Berg’s <i>Lulu</i>, setting the drama against the backdrop of
  the Civil Rights Movement, and specifying that the characters of Lulu,
  Geschwitz, and Schigolch are black; <i>Katrina Ballads</i>, by Ted Hearnes
  uses found text from survivors of Hurricane Katrina, composing in a hybrid of
  New Orleans styles. The operas by Neuwirth and Davis were both panned by the
  press, while <i>Katrina Ballads</i> was acclaimed, winning the prestigious
  Gaudeamus Prize.</p>
  <p>Characterized as Afro-pessimism, the critical race theories of Michelle
  Wright, Hortense Spillers, and Saidiya Hartman create frameworks for
  understanding the notion of a dehumanized black subject. Through analysis of
  critical reception as well as statements by the composers themselves, I argue
  that Afro-pessimism offers a compelling way to understand the racializing
  imaginaries of Euro-American new music communities. Furthermore, I argue that
  the cultural implications of Afro-pessimism manifests differently depending on
  the identities of the composers. As white composers, what do Hearnes and
  Neuwirth stand to gain or lose by staging black voices and bodies in their
  works, and how do these stakes differ given that Hearnes is male and Neuwirth
  female? What does it mean that Davis, a black composer, was criticized for his
  “noble” portrayal of black identity, while Hearnes, a white composer, was
  lauded for portraying black Americans perishing in a tragedy of the recent
  past? Through such intersectional analysis, I explore the fantasies of
  blackness that circulate among participants in transatlantic new music
  communities.</p>
