    <p>Anthropologist Victor Turner has theorized how rites of passage function as spacetimes of radical flux, ever “betwixt and between” as he famously put it. He introduces the term <em>liminoid</em> to describe liminal-like phenomena expressing what he calls a “proto-” or “anti-structure,” a structure without an underlying norm that operates by “generat[ing] a plurality of alternative models … capable of influencing behaviors … in the direction of radical change.” This resonates with what poet and theorist Léopold Sédar Senghor characterizes as a dynamic, ever-inventive and proliferating rhythmic repetition that flows across diverse African artistic practices.</p>
    <p>Similarly, philosopher Tseney Serequeberhan argues against teleology by inverting the Western creative impetus such that, for example, an African drum-dance performance—always a product of collaborative improvised elaboration of relatively fixed material—is continually “projecting itself out of its effective past … in a constant process of self-interpretation and … re-interpretation.” The future of any performance is unknown, negotiated among participants, and animated by a spirit of <em>play</em>. Play functions as a conceptual foil to the teleological working-out of a predetermined idea. Because most African drum-dance musics are cyclic and quasi-repetitive, every performance continually invents or reveals new adumbrational possibilities.</p>
    <p>This paper challenges the centrality of formal coherence as a signifier of musical value. Focusing on an ensemble performance from the Central African Republic, it shows how while every new event relates backward to earlier moments in the performance that helped determine its emergent identity, the question of what happens next always remains open and contingent.</p>
