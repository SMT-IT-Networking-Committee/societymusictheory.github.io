abstract: |
  <p>Though the legacy of composer-vocalist Julius Eastman (1940–90) has recently
  become the subject of considerable academic and public scrutiny, little work
  has yet been done on his ties to the expressive practices associated with the
  African American improvisative tradition. So far, the lion’s share of attention
  has gone to his self-styled “Nigger Series”—their collective title
  notwithstanding, scores arguably situatable within a Eurological, pulsed
  minimalist canon. But in earlier works, Eastman’s “minimalism” had a different
  valence, a quasi-improvisative, Afrological ethos absorbed from postwar jazz.
  So committed was he to this ethos that by the mid-1970s, he attempted to
  rebrand himself as a jazz artist.</p>
  <p>Drawing in part on original interviews, my paper presents a reading of one
  of the key moments in that evolution, Eastman’s <i>Femenine</i> [sic] (1974),
  and teases out the piece’s quasi-improvisative features that, vis-à-vis
  another, related score, occasioned the epithet “Philip Glass with soul.”
  Indeed, Eastman eschewed Glass’s cool precision, instead favoring riff-based
  and citational structures closely connected to what he referred to as jazz’s
  scope for “instant expressions of feelings.”</p>
  <p>Yet Eastman’s artistic production was also nothing if not intersectional,
  and as a gay man, he was concerned to merge camp performative strategies with
  earnest “self-expression”: what Ann Pellegrini (2007) dubs “camp sincerity.”
  But as George Lewis (1996) notes, the post-Cagean improvisative circles in
  which Eastman made his name enforced an unspoken ban on “self-expression.”
  This, I will also argue, provided the occasion for his estrangement from
  Eurological practice, in favor of the evening-length, wholly improvised solo
  piano format, then in vogue due to the success of Keith Jarrett’s <i>Köln
  Concert</i>. In Eastman’s hands, the format, with its “epic,” heightened
  “romanticism,” became the ideal vehicle for “camp sincerity,” allowing him to
  realize ideas first broached in pieces like <i>Femenine</i>.</p>
  <p>In attending to Eastman’s artistic production, I aim to help reorient the
  histories of jazz and minimalism, pointing up Afrological genealogies too often
  underplayed in Eurological accounts of the latter. As for Eastman, however,
  former colleagues recall the black jazz community treating his homosexuality
  with hostility, rendering such reorienting at once tragic and ironic.</p>
