abstract: |
    <p>Punk was first developed mostly by white American baby boomers as an expression of paradigmatic changes in postwar society, including “white flight” to the suburbs and the continued mass movement of African Americans during the Second Great Migration. Today, punk is considered one of the “whitest” genres of music, although musical analysis reveals close ties to shared common stock sources and styles primarily associated with African Americans. Initial intimations of the punk style came from musicians in the late 1960s and early 1970s such as the Stooges and the MC5 who were heavily engaged with Black music. Early American punk musicians such as the Ramones and Blondie drew on a range of common stock sources, with a particular focus on the uses of common stock resources in the music of the late 1950s and early 1960s of their childhoods, such as doo-wop. Early American punk rockers especially articulated a complicated relationship to Black music, sometimes reinforcing and sometimes obscuring the connections, and punk’s critics further severed ties between punk and its multifaceted musical past. The result was a tension between punk’s musical genealogy and narratives about punk’s whiteness, and the ambiguities surrounding whiteness and blackness in punk became a core element of the style. Placing the compositional choices and performance styles of early American punk musicians in the specific context of the racial landscape of the 1970s sheds new light on that era and its contemporary importance, especially for formations of American whiteness that persist today.</p>
