abstract: |
  <p>The years between the First and Second World Wars were characterized by
  tremendous confusion, if not a complete identity crisis, in British music as
  social upheavals that came in the wake of the First World War ushered in an era
  of rapid change and development that altered every facet of life. In recent
  years, musicologists have devoted increasing attention to this period,
  particularly in relation to aspects of modernism and nationalism. This growing
  body of scholarship, however, has focused almost exclusively on male composers,
  thus marginalizing the contribution of women such as Elizabeth Maconchy
  (1907–94), who was widely considered to be at the forefront of the generation
  of British composers emerging in the 1930s. </p>
  <p>This paper examines Maconchy’s career and reception within the context of
  fluctuating attitudes towards modern music during the interwar period. She was
  variously described in the press as British, Irish, English, and Scottish: the
  question of national identity loomed large around the reception of Maconchy’s
  music. While Maconchy’s music was initially praised for its radically “modern,”
  yet distinctly “British” idiom in the early 1930s, as the decade progressed and
  her reputation grew rapidly in Europe, her works were increasingly critiqued in
  Britain for being too cerebral and dissonant—criticisms of aspects of her music
  that were praised on the Continent. Through detailed analysis of Maconchy’s
  reception both at home and abroad, I argue that the shift in the reception of
  her music highlights broader conflicts between notions of identity and
  Britishness that can be understood as deeply entwined with tensions between
  nationalism and internationalism that permeated musical life in the years
  leading up to the Second World War. </p>
