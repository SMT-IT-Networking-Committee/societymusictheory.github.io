abstract: | 
    <p>Kate Bush’s unique songwriting has been examined and celebrated in terms of harmony, lyrics, vocal technique, and studio effects (Moy 2007; Cawood 2016; Forrest 2021). This paper examines how her songs make expressive use of hypermetric disruptions. These patterns foreshadow the temporal experimentation in her final two albums (Withers 2017). While small, temporary disruptions in hypermeter are common in popular songs, Bush songs employ these disruptions with much more frequency and variety than those of her contemporaries, placing her songs in dialogue with studies of expressive use of hypermetric disruptions, such as Cohn 1992. This paper examines hypermetric groupings in Bush’s most successful songs and categorizes the disruptions into three functions: extension, expansion, and truncation. This paper also explores how these disruptions contribute to both delineating and blurring formal boundaries as well as painting the given song’s narrative. </p>
    <p>To determine a song’s meter, this paper relies primarily on rhythmic ostinato, harmonic rhythm, and, following De Clercq 2016, absolute time. To determine hypermetric groups, this paper examines harmonic and melodic repetition, accompaniment patterns, texture and timbre changes, and harmonic and melodic phrasing. While, in many popular songs, these elements combine to show clear hypermetric patterns, Bush’s songs frequently set these elements at odds with each other. Therefore, this list is in prioritized order.</p>
