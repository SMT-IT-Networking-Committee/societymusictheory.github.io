    <p>Latin America’s most successful early electroacoustic studio was hosted at the <em>Centro Latinoamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales </em>(CLAEM), part of the Torcuato Di Tella Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A combination of resourceful innovation and productive collaboration during its eight years of existence earned CLAEM’s <em>Laboratorio de música electrónica</em> (1964–1971) an important place in the regional and transnational world of contemporary music. Composers and music critics in Buenos Aires found a natural affinity between experimentation and the creation of electroacoustic compositions. The connection was such, that the label música experimental (experimental music) was used interchangeably with música electrónica (electronic music). This allowed electroacoustic music to function discursively within Cold War imaginaries of music composition as research, not only referring to the development of techniques or apparatus but also in reference to the compositional process of these works. The use of the word <em>laboratorio</em> in the name of CLAEM’s studio was not coincidental; many aspects of electroacoustic creation were discussed through allusions originated in the scientific world, which further corroborates the idea of electroacoustic music as experimentation and closely related to the sciences. In this presentation, I argue that the grounding of the connection research - electroacoustic composition was a pedagogical methodology that explained the creative act in three stages: generation, elaboration, and assembly (or montage) of materials. Such understanding of the creative process in the electroacoustic studio extended to the different pieces of equipment which were classified in correspondence to one of those stages, giving a profound sense of industry and technology to electroacoustic experimentation. As a lateral consequence, new insight emerges regarding the conditions of a Latin American electronic studio within the economies and politics of the Cold War.</p>
