abstract: |
  <p>Like most artists, composer Elisabeth Lutyens and her second husband, the
  conductor, BBC and ISCM official, and impresario Edward Clark, were adamant
  about the independence of their respective work in music. They would have
  denied that they were collaborators, both in order to protect Lutyens’s claim
  to a self-invented British serialism, and Clark’s work as a conductor. While
  this autobiographical narrative strategy has held sway, it is fragile. </p>
  <p>Clark’s impact peaked with his pioneering BBC programming from 1927 to 1936,
  but Lutyens emerges post-World War II as one of the country’s first and most
  influential dodecaphonist composers and a prolific writer of music for film,
  television, and radio. This paper traces the couple’s professional
  intersections after the beginning of their personal and professional
  partnership in 1939. Lutyens began to call Clark her “yardstick”; he was also
  her conductor of choice of her large volume of incidental music for BBC Radio
  features, and after his death she turned herself into a proto-“widow
  biographer” seeking to protect his damaged reputation. Yet these efforts
  coincide with an unusual chronology in this couple’s collaborations: Clark’s
  star faded as Lutyens’s rose. This makes them a curious example of the “Héloïse
  complex,” which this paper introduces as a map for navigating this (and other)
  couples’ autobiographical strategies. Deployed in studies of collaborations
  between spouses in philosophy and literature, the Héloïse complex describes a
  scenario in which a younger female philosopher (or here composer) “idolizes a
  male colleague or teacher . . . whose banner they carry” but by whom they are
  eventually betrayed or left to find their own voice (<i>Oxford Companion to
  Philosophy</i>, 2005). Looking at Lutyens and Clark’s case through the lens of
  this theory enables a broader perspective on collaboration in British
  twentieth-century music making and beyond, but this couple can also serve to
  complicate the theory itself, which, being an instrument of 1970s French
  feminism, can otherwise seem restrictive. </p>
