  <p>During and since its initial 1935 run on Broadway, George Gershwin’s
  <i>Porgy and Bess</i> has been plagued by issues of genre. Is the work a
  musical or an opera? Joseph Swain summarizes this debate, stating that
  “generally, the drama critics objected to the recitative per se and the music
  critics to ‘Summertime,’ ‘I Got Plenty o’ Nuttin’,’ and other tunes which
  seemed ‘too popular’ for opera.” Gershwin himself pushed back against these
  critics in a <i>New York Times</i> piece, where he stated “Nearly all of
  Verdi’s operas contain what are known as ‘song hits.’” Despite the work’s mix
  of both popular and art-music elements, however, academic commentary on the
  opera has tended to favor the operatic, leaving the popular understudied and
  underrepresented.</p>
  <p>Based on Wayne Shirley’s new critical edition of Gershwin’s opera, this
  project approaches the “song hits” of <i>Porgy and Bess </i>through the lens
  of popular music. It reveals the frequency with which Gershwin employed AABA
  formal frameworks as well as harmonic and lyric paradigms found in jazz and
  blues. Viewing <i>Porgy and Bess </i>through this lens not only reveals the
  compositional techniques at work, but also uncovers popular influences, such
  as Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and Cab Calloway in addition to the more
  traditional Western influences of Alban Berg and Joseph Schillinger.
  Furthermore, recognizing these elements creates a space for considering the
  role of popular music in <i>Porgy and Bess </i>and opera at large.</p>
  <p>Emphasizing the importance of popular music in Gershwin’s life, the preface
  to Howard Pollack’s monumental biography recognizes “Gershwin as fundamentally
  a man of the theater.” Moreover, Lindberg and Forte assert that American
  popular music was already moving towards modernism, problematizing the notion
  that Gershwin’s influences can be broken down into a simple “popular” and
  “high art” binary. The purpose of this project therefore, is not to discount
  the influence of European art music on Gershwin, but rather to provide a more
  nuanced view of the opera by acknowledging the influence of the two worlds
  that Gershwin inhabited. Otherwise, we are only looking at half of the picture
  of one of America’s most celebrated composers. </p>
