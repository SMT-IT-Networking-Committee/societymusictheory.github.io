    <p>Adolph Bernhard Marx (1799–1866) did not mince words about the “goal of
    the whole <i>Formenlehre</i>”: “in it and with it, and through it,” he
    wrote, “we become free.” Contrary to received wisdom, what Marx called the
    “last steps to freedom” are not taken in sonata form. Rather, they happen
    in “fantasy,” which, he wrote, “can follow no predetermined path or have a
    predetermined form, because it is indeed just the giving up of such a
    determined form.” Marx’s fantasy thus conforms to Seth Brodsky’s
    psychoanalytic reading of musical fantasy as a constitutive gap, a “code
    of no code, an executive order suspending order, a masterful unmastery.”
    Fantasy is the form with no form.</p>
    <p>And yet, Marx cites specific, determinate examples of fantasy. Pieces
    by Mozart and Beethoven become opportunities to leverage a discourse in
    which, as Brodsky observes, “‘freedom’ becomes [the] urtext, a mortified
    signifier it is now tasked with revivifying and filling out.” In short,
    Marx turns the musical form of fantasy into a fantasy about musical form,
    a fantasy in Freud’s sense: a “fulfillment of a wish, a correction of an
    unsatisfying reality” that represses “distressing ideas…[that] threaten
    happiness or self-esteem.” These distressing ideas, I argue, originated in
    Marx’s Jewish heritage and were experienced through the politics of
    German-Jewish assimilation. His fantasy, manifested in a working-through
    of musical forms, thus reveals the political stakes of <i>Formenlehre</i>
    at the moment of its historical articulation.</p>
