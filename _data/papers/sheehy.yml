abstract: |
    <p>The <i>Follies of 1907</i> initiated Florenz Ziegfeld’s lasting
    Broadway legacy, a revue known for its opulent costumes and scenery, its
    provocative musical numbers, and, perhaps most of all, for its chorus
    girls.  The Follies strove to portray an “All-American” female sexuality,
    an image suggested through songs that emphasize the “exotic” as an
    opposition to Ziegfeld’s ideal “American” woman. Featuring an all-white
    cast, the <i>Follies of 1907</i> highlighted comedic musical numbers
    performed in blackface, which exoticized—thereby sexualizing and
    demeaning—the protagonists they portrayed.</p>

    <p>This paper analyzes three unrecorded “exotic” songs from the <i>Follies
    of 1907</i>—“My Pocahontas,” “Miss Ginger from Jamaica,” and “Come Down
    Salomy Jane,” which respectively portray a Native American woman, a black
    Caribbean woman, and a black woman from the American south. I scrutinize
    the lewd lyrics, racialized performance practices, and stereotyped
    “exotic” musical styles of these songs—three elements that reveal the
    prejudicial portrayal of marginalized peoples in early Broadway
    history.</p>

    <p>I explore the first number as a representation of the “Americanization”
    of the exotic female. My examination of the song’s lyrics reveals a stark
    chauvinism; I support this claim with musical analysis of the score and
    the dichotomy between the stereotypically exotic-sounding verses and the
    sweeping melodiousness of the refrain. My analysis of the second number
    explores the “fantasy” of the exotic female. I dissect the distasteful,
    overtly sexualized lyrics within the context of their performance by a
    white singer in blackface. I also consider the over-simplification of the
    song’s melodic and harmonic structures, features that endorse the
    protagonist’s reduction into a mere sexual commodity. Finally, my
    exploration of the third number reveals the “comedy” of the exotic female
    and the use of racial stereotypes—exploited both in the song’s lyrics and
    minstrelsy-inspired musical elements—to create humor at the expense of the
    female and the Other.</p>

    <p>Through a detailed examination of the text and musical elements of
    these three songs featured the <i>Follies of 1907</i>, I uncover several
    implications of the comedic sexualization of non-white women on stage and
    the staggering popularity that such performances gained within the white
    American public at the time.</p>
