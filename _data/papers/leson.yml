abstract: |
  <p>When Helen Thigpen and Earl Jackson, singers in Robert Breen and Blevins
  Davis’s mid-1950s production of <i>Porgy and Bess</i>, married in a Moscow
  church on 17 January 1956, the whole world seemed to be watching. Both
  American and Soviet press covered the Baptist service, and more than 2,500
  Muscovites crammed into or waited outside of the church where the celebrity
  couple was joined in holy matrimony. <i>Life </i>magazine’s full-page feature
  highlighted the socio-economic differences between the glamorous stars of
  <i>Porgy and Bess</i> and Moscow’s bundled babushkas, underscoring not only
  the rising status of African Americans in the US, but abuse of the faithful in
  the Soviet Union. Religious belief had become a weapon of Cold War propaganda.

  <p>Scholars have explored the use of Breen-Davis’s <i>Porgy and Bess </i>and
  its stellar ensemble cast to counter Soviet criticism of US race relations
  during the Cold War. But an equally prominent theme in contemporary coverage
  of the production was spirituality, a largely unexplored dimension of the
  opera. Onstage as well as off, <i>Porgy and Bess </i>symbolized American
  piety, echoing President Truman’s assertion that democracy’s most powerful
  weapon against the godless Soviet enemy was neither a gun nor a bomb, but
  faith.</p>
  <p>This paper focuses primarily on the American reception of the 1955–56
  Soviet tour, as the production projected an image of a nation that embodied
  both racial tolerance and religious plurality while criticizing the Soviet
  Union’s state atheism and anti-religious attitudes. Drawing on materials from
  the Robert Breen collection housed in the Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee
  Theatre Research Institute at The Ohio State University, my research considers
  Breen-Davis’s <i>Porgy and Bess</i> as a religious export to the USSR,
  enriching our understanding of US cultural diplomacy and Cold War-era exchange
  with broader implications for American-Soviet history, religious studies, and
  opera analysis. </p>
