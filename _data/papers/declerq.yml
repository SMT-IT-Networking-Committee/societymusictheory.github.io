    <p>When teaching my first-semester music theory class, I have used the Michael Jackson song “Black or White” to transition between the topic of traditional blues forms and more pop- oriented blues structures. There are a number of reasons why I find “Black or White” to be a good musical example, a central one being the bass line by Terry Jackson (no relation to</p>
    <p>Michael), which is frolicsome and groovy but also harmonically clear and forward in the mix. Yet “Black or White” is also a very problematic example, given the multiple allegations of child sexual abuse against Michael Jackson. It would not be difficult to find a substitute example for my lesson plans. But if I cancel Michael Jackson, I also cancel Terry Jackson and his signature bass line. Is that fair? Sadly, Terry Jackson cannot voice his opinion, since his career was cut tragically short in March 1991 when he died at the age of 28 while on tour for Reba McEntire, months before “Black or White” saw commercial release (in November 1991).</p>
    <p>In my brief discussion, I consider the fallout from avoiding the music of monstrous musicians on the legacies of their musical collaborators. What are the side effects of cancel culture, particularly on the work of the often faceless and nameless studio musicians, songwriters, engineers, producers, and other support personnel? This question seems especially relevant to college music teachers, given that most students, if they enter the music industry, will be working in these behind-the-scenes roles. As part of a solution, I propose de-emphasizing celebrity culture in the classroom and instead focusing more on the larger picture of people involved in a recording. Ultimately, I argue against avoiding these problematic examples in favor of providing a more comprehensive context for all music we use in the classroom.</p>
