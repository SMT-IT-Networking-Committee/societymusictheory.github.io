abstract: |
    <p>Accreditation is often used as a boogey-man to scare faculty into completing assessment tasks for middle-management administrators.
    This paper presents a rubric-based methodology for assessing the impact of music theory on the proficiency attained in the general education
    outcomes. Given the small sample size of students who complete a music theory class to the overall student population,
    the results are not meaningful or duplicable.</p>
