    <p>Hans Keller developed his method of “functional analysis” (FA), which
    he described as “the <i>musical</i> analysis of music.” Heavily influenced by
    his studies in Freudian psychology, Keller believed that his analyses revealed
    “the latent unity behind manifest contrasts,” without using any labels or
    descriptive prose. In an effort to make explicit to his listeners what he
    believed to have been the composer’s own unified perception of the work,
    Keller’s analyses set between-movement interludes that extracted, juxtaposed,
    and modified prominent themes, and included intervals of silence, during which
    listeners were to reflect on what they had just heard. Keller produced a total
    of fourteen FAs (Figure 3), focusing primarily on the music of Haydn, Mozart,
    and Beethoven. These functional analyses have often been remarked
    upon—frequently appearing in the same breath as Rudolph Reti’s motivic
    studies, or even Schenkerian analysis—but their musical details have never
    been systematically studied. This paper explores Keller’s first functional
    analysis, of Mozart’s D Minor String Quartet (K. 421), revealing Keller’s
    analytical interest in the relationships between the motives and themes of a
    given movement, and with motivic connections and thematic transformations
    <i>across</i> movements. Through Keller’s re-arrangements of motives and
    themes, the listener is meant to <i>hear</i> one motive gradually transforming
    into the other. Keller’s FAs are thus revealed as a style of analysis whose
    form—a musical performance—mirrors its content: a mediation between the
    listener’s experience and the non-linear temporality of compositional
    labor.</p>
