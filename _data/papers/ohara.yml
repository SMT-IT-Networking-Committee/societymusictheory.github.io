Techniques, and Custom Instruments in Solo Pop Covers"

    <p>They begin with a note, a chord, the tap of a button, or the triggering
    of a loop: through progressively layered textures, samples, and extended
    performance techniques, solo cover songs on YouTube often construct
    themselves piece by piece before the viewer’s eyes and ears. Combining
    virtuosity and novelty in a package ready-made for viral online
    popularity, this recent and rapidly growing internet phenomenon draws
    together traditions old and new, from the “one-man band” of the 19th
    century, to the experimental live looping of 1980s performance art, to
    contemporary electronic music. This presentation examines three recent
    popular YouTube videos in order to study the ways in which amateur
    musicians craft such arrangements through a combination of creativity and
    music-analytical understanding.</p>
    <p>Building on a number of recent studies that examine the affordances and
    restrictions of writing and performing music on various instruments, I
    explore how these YouTube performers use theoretical and instrumental
    expertise to convey complex textures through a minimal collection of
    musical materials. In each case, the instruments themselves are arranged,
    modified, or even created in order to make these performances possible.
    The videos often incorporate looped or layered elements, arranged to take
    advantage of a song’s harmonic or rhythmic structures; and they frequently
    feature customized, self-created, or otherwise unconventional
    instrumentation. Through their sparse, economic construction, these
    intricate arrangements are each the end product of a careful analysis of
    each song, and they have much to teach us about the harmonic, melodic, and
    rhythmic structures of popular music.</p>
