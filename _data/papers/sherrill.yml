    <p>This paper generalizes a familiar fact about the seven diatonic modes:
    they can be ranked unambiguously in terms of pitch height relative to a
    fixed tonic. For instance, every pitch of C locrian is lower than or equal
    to the corresponding scale degree of C phrygian; likewise, phrygian is no
    higher than aeolian, and so on. To use a metaphorical mapping common in
    jazz chord-scale pedagogy, locrian is therefore the “darkest” of the
    diatonic modes and lydian the “brightest.” This paper generalizes that
    phenomenon to the modes of arbitrary scales. Most scales do not admit a
    simple linear ordering in terms of brightness. Instead, most scales
    exhibit a partial order in which some modes are neither brighter nor
    darker than others. This partial order offers a way of characterizing a
    scale’s internal construction at a productive level of generality.</p>
    <p>After motivating the concept of brightness with analyses of passages
    from Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i> and two works by Saint-Saëns, the paper
    explores several concepts and useful results for modelling modal
    brightness. These include two different partial orders of brightness, a
    description of the geometry underlying scales’ varying structures, and a
    pair of constants that characterize different scales. (Perhaps
    surprisingly, the natural definition of evenness is not a useful
    characterization, as scales representing any structure can be made
    arbitrarily even.) The theory provides a framework that draws together
    geometric, algebraic, and combinatoric models of musical scales, offering
    a generalization of concepts like “well formedness” to all scales.</p>
