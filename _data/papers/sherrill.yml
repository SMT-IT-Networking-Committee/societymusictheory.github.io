abstract: |
    <p>Taking the arias and small ensembles of<i> Le nozze di Figaro</i> as
    examples, this paper investigates how Mozart uses recitative as a musical
    topic imported into periodic music. Although most memorably the trio “Cosa
    sento!” lapses into a long passage of <i>accompagnato </i>narration, many
    of the opera’s numbers involve fleeting intrusions of the recitative
    topic. Mozart’s use of recitative in these moments evinces a semiotic
    grammar in which topical signals reliably help to construct theatrical and
    expressive meaning.</p>

    <p>The basis of that expressive grammar lies in the way these topical
    borrowings pit two incommensurate formal systems against one another. As
    intrusions into periodic music, passages of recitative necessarily have a
    “contextual” formal function as, for instance, the beginning of a
    consequent phrase. But the recitative gestures themselves import an
    “intrinsic” formal function from the phrasal syntax of recitative. Because
    both systems serve their own theatrical ends, a number that navigates
    between them can chart novel types of meaning.</p>

    <p>For instance, in “Cinque... dieci...” Figaro misdeploys a recitative
    question formula in place of a cadence just at the moment that his stage
    business goes awry. Figaro’s melodic gesture, though it would articulate a
    satisfactory close within recitative, fails to fit the duet’s cadential
    rhetoric: as a topical intrusion, it does not participate in the chain of
    implications and realizations that drives formal function. It thus overlaps
    the end of Figaro’s action-music with a comical aside, creating (like all
    recitative intrusions) a Hattenesque “trope” of two temporalities.</p>
