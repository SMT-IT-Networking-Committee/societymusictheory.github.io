title: "Decolonizing Music Pedagogy: Two Settler Perspectives on the Undergraduate Music Curriculum"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>As both the AMS and the SMT grapple with a lack of diversity in students,
  instructors, and curriculum, Canadian (and many American) institutions are
  faced with a related challenge: the need to decolonize and Indigenize course
  content and pedagogies (Truth and Reconciliation Commission 2015, Tuck and
  Yang 2012). While decolonization does not equate with diversity per se, such
  efforts would lead to a broadening of epistemologies and repertoire in the
  classroom, and, it is hoped, of student and instructor identities as well.</p>
  <p>This paper will report on the efforts of two contingent faculty, one
  historian and one theorist, to decolonize aspects of upper-year undergraduate
  seminars (Music in Canada and Contemporary Popular Music Analysis) taught in a
  small Canadian music department. The authors will begin by outlining the
  theoretical foundations that informed course design decisions (including
  Indigenous educational models as described in Battiste 2013, Pete 2016, and
  Bradley 2012, and settler-colonial literature including Mackey 2002, Lowman
  and Barker 2015, and Coulthard 2014). Next, the authors will discuss their
  application of these theories in detail, describing decolonized course units,
  class activities, and assignments both large and small, using samples of
  student work to demonstrate the impact of decolonization on student learning.
  The final section will critically reflect on the decolonization process in
  these courses, emphasizing both the strengths and weaknesses of the authors’
  approaches, and also considering reactions from colleagues to highlight some
  of the potential career risks and benefits for contingent faculty seeking to
  diversify their teaching practices and their disciplines.</p>
