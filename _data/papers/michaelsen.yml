    <p>While jazz improvisations are often based on melodies and repeating harmonic frameworks, many other materials make up the pre-improvisational structures on which an improvisation may be based. The late music psychologist Jeff Pressing coined the term “referent” to describe these materials: “an underlying formal scheme or guiding image specific to a given piece, used by the improviser to facilitate the generation and editing of improvised behavior on an intermediate time scale” (1984, 346). In previous work, I have construed the referent as a “domain” of musical interaction that “operates like an additional band member, influencing the utterances of the musicians throughout and occasionally being modified by the musicians’ alterations or additions” (Michaelsen 2019, [26]). While this additional, invisible band member often takes the form of a set of musical structures, it sometimes takes the form of a person. In this paper, I explore the ways in which Miles Davis often refers to himself—in the form of his own prior utterances—while performing. In doing so, Davis creates complex chains of influence from one performance to the next. I will focus on one particular and notable chain in Davis’s recorded output: his existing recordings of the Tin-Pan-Alley standard “My Funny Valentine.” In reflection of his idiosyncratic improvisational aesthetic, Davis expressly refers to his own customary way of playing a tune over any other version. His playing establishes a self-referent that is inextricable from his musical identity; Davis doesn’t play “My Funny Valentine,” he plays himself playing it.</p>
