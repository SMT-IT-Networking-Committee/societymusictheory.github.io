    <p>A provocative title such as “Hemiolas in Non-Isochronous Meters” likely
    arouses skepticism. Indeed, non-isochronous meters are incompatible with
    Richard Cohn’s conception of hemiolas: “any successive or simultaneous
    conflict between a bisection and trisection of a single time-span.” To
    follow Cohn’s designation, grouping dissonance across the time-span of a
    5/4 measure would need to be divided into two (2 1/2 quarter-notes) and
    three (1 2/3 quarter-notes), whereas in musical practice, 5/4 meters
    typically divide to 2+3 or 3+2 quarter-notes. Cohn recognizes the
    limitations of his methodology regarding non-isochronous pulses, which are
    addressed by Zachary Cairns. Cairns posits “shared-cardinality grouping
    dissonances” that occur in non-isochronous meters (i.e., 5/4 grouped as
    2+3 vs. 5/4 grouped as 3+2 shown with Lerdahl/Jackendoff-style dots).
    Although Cairns’s methodology effectively illustrates occurrences of
    grouping dissonance involving non-isochronous pulses, it does not
    illuminate relative level of dissonance as Cohn does. Cohn addresses level
    of dissonance by expounding simple, double, and complex hemiolas, the
    latter defined as 2:3 conflict occurring at three or more metrical levels.
    This poster brings together Cairns’s discussions of shared-cardinality
    grouping dissonance and Cohn’s discussions of hemiolas by modifying Cohn’s
    metric states and metric space visuals to allow for non-isochronous
    pulses. These modifications illuminate metrical conflict in a variety of
    repertoires, including Holst’s “Mars” from <i>The Planets</i>, Gabriel
    Pierné’s Piano Quintet, no. 41, and Heitor Villa-Lobos’s <i>Próle do
    Bébé</i>, no. 2.</p>
