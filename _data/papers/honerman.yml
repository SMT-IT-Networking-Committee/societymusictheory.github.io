    <p>I do not think it is a question of <em>if</em> we should include these problematic artists in our lessons; if there is a pertinent musical element in the example, then there is surely a valid reason for using it in class. Rather, I argue that it is both a question of <em>how</em> we can incorporate these examples and also <em>why</em> it is important to include the uncomfortable parts of their histories alongside the music.</p>
    <p><em>How</em>: Robin Attas discusses three models for integrating social justice topics alongside musical examples. The same models can be applied here with some adaptations. I argue that if a lesson plan calls for “plug and play” examples, then perhaps music by these artists should not be included; there are plenty of examples by unproblematic artists we can use to enrich our lessons. If the lesson allows room for discussion through a “concept model” or to create a larger unit via the “social justice model”, then these examples would be able to serve as a point of entry into discussions on power, danger, and prejudice.</p>
    <p><em>Why</em>: Thanks to the constant stream of information flowing through all depths of the internet, students are likely savvy to the happenings in popular culture. Over the past five years, conversations about power, danger, and prejudice have occurred on a grand scale through the #MeToo movement and more recently through the Black Lives Matter movement. Music is not free from either of these conversations and it is imperative that we find ways to facilitate discussions on where music falls within these movements as well as throughout history. I believe it is our duty as educators to provide students with a space not only to learn musical concepts but also to engage in meaningful conversations about the music and its creators.</p>
