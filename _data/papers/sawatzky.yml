    <p>Using three Slavic folk tunes, I demonstrate an analytical approach for irregular phrase-rhythmic structures that involves anti-metrical motivic parallelisms and aperiodicities. The three generative analyses illustrate how melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic groupings interact to create phrase-rhythm, regardless of whether the structures involved are periodic enough to establish hypermeter, or idiomatic enough to invite comparison to normative phrase lengths. The music theory literature has addressed issues of rhythmic/metric irregularity, including well-known accounts of irregular rhythm in Stravinsky (for whom Slavic folk tunes were a source material). Analyzing rhythmic irregularity in Stravinsky’s music, theorists have described the unique time-sense engendered by aperiodic structures using concepts such as Van den Toorn’s “strong-weak reversal” or Horlacher’s “metric reinterpretation.” Both concepts involve analyzing phrase-rhythmic irregularity with reference to how a passage conforms to some <em>a priori</em> regular metric structure; i.e. irregular tunes are described in terms of what they distort rather than in terms of what they create. I describe irregularity in positive terms by conceiving of meter and phrase-type as generative rather than conformational schemas (Bonds, 1991). The generative view I endorse does not take alternate possibilities to be in conflict (e.g. Krebs’ “metrical dissonance”), nor as an ambiguity to be clarified by the performer (e.g. London’s “metric malleability”). Instead, I propose that co-present grouping structures mutually inform one another and establish phrase-rhythmic multivalences, imbuing these short and repetitive game-songs with their characteristic playfulness. In this way, their phrase-rhythmic whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
