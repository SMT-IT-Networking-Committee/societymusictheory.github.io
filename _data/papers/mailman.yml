abstract: |
    <p>Both Gérard Grisey and his posthumous philosophical apologist Hugues
    Dufourt emphasize Grisey’s innovative approach to temporality.
    Surprisingly, a processive model for analyzing Grisey’s forms has not
    emerged. Theorists have shied away from modeling formal processes in
    Grisey’s music perhaps because the appropriate modeling conflicts with
    Grisey’s and Dufourt’s ideological pronouncements as grounded in the
    anti-quantitative polemics of French process philosopher Henri Bergson.
    Yet, resisting or overcoming Bergson’s, Grisey’s, and Dufourt’s
    limitations, to instead offer a mathematical modeling of Grisey’s music, we
    achieve a more ecological understanding of its distinctive processive
    temporality and holistic character.</p>
    <p>Grisey’s <i>Vortex Temporum</i> presents a motif from Ravel’s <i>Daphnis
    et Chloé</i>, developed through naturalistic interaction between difference
    and repetition, a conceptual pairing celebrated by Bergsonian philosopher
    Gilles Deleuze. The motif changes are modeled (“curve fitted”) with basic
    mathematical equations also known for modeling such natural phenomena as
    circadian rhythms, respiration, climate cycles, sound, and hydrodynamics,
    including the spiral motion of vortices. Specifically: (1) The motif’s
    shape is modeled as “harmonically” related sine wave oscillators, a smooth,
    subtly complex, naturalistic wave, in a two-dimensional plane: a twirling
    motion; (2) The motif’s timings are modeled as a sum of sinewave
    oscillation, linear trend, and random noise, relating to the fluidly
    semi-predictable teleology of these repetitions; (3) The motif’s
    transpositions are modeled as an exponentially amplifying oscillator; this
    amplifying oscillator form is shared with Ligeti’s Violin Concerto (Mailman
    2016), composed only four years earlier. Both works exhibit a wavelike
    trend of increasing volatility, which can also be visualized as a spiral or
    vortex.</p>
