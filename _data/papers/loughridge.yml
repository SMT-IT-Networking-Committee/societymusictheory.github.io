  <p>For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, music belonged to humans alone. “Birds whistle;
  man alone sings,” he wrote. “As soon as vocal signs strike your ear, they
  announce to you a being like yourself. They are, so to speak, the organ of the
  soul” (<i>Essai sur l’origine des langues</i>, 1781). Rousseau’s fellow
  encyclopedist Denis Diderot, by contrast, found the “accents of the voice” to
  be common to many animals; it was instead the “language of fingers and
  gestures” that Diderot considered specific to the human species (<i>Histoire
  des deux Indes</i>, 1770). But whereas Rousseau conceived humans, endowed with
  a spiritual power of free agency, as different in kind from all else,
  Diderot—an avowed materialist—thought of humans as different only in degree of
  organization. Diderot expressed this materialist outlook through the image of
  a philosopher as a harpsichord with sensibility and memory—a sentient
  instrument in which vibrating strings mediated perception and thought (<i>Le
  Rêve de d’Alembert</i>, 1769).</p>
  <p>The influence of Rousseau’s ideas on subsequent generations has been richly
  attested (Fulcher, Simon, Waeber). But in light of the “nonhuman turn”
  (Grusin), it is now Diderot’s ideas that resonate more strongly with
  contemporary theories of materiality, agency, and human/nonhuman relations.
  Indeed, like Diderot, theorists such as Jane Bennett and Ian Bogost have
  challenged orthodoxies about human exceptionalism, and used anthropomorphism
  to help cultivate a sense of common materiality and wider distribution of
  agency.</p>
  <p>This paper examines how Rousseau and Diderot used music to draw boundaries
  or continuities between humans and nonhumans, so as to suggest how musical
  practice and thought today have both hindered and contributed to the project
  of a nonhuman turn. As this look back at the eighteenth century demonstrates,
  the soul and singing voice facilitated thinking “the human” in absolute
  difference from the “nonhuman”; fingers and vibrating strings supported
  thinking the human and nonhuman in continuity and interaction. Thus where
  today’s “new materialists” have offered mainly visual and discursive
  strategies for perceiving the liveliness of all matter, Diderot and Rousseau
  show how—and how not—to listen musically for common materiality and
  distributed agency.</p>
