abstract: |
  <p>In the late 1930s, the Polish-born Hollywood actor Joseph Green produced
  four popular Yiddish films that depicted the full range of Jewish life in
  Poland, from shtetl to city, from sacred to secular, and from traditional to
  modern. Using Jewish rituals and music, Green conjured a specifically Yiddish
  world that Yiddish-speaking audiences everywhere recognized from their daily
  lives. While Yiddish film scholars such as Eric Goldman and Zehavit Stein
  conclude that these rituals ultimately affirm the Jewish identity of the film
  audience, their arguments typically rely on visual and dramatic evidence,
  ignoring the crucial role that sound and music play in Yiddish films from the
  late 1930s. Indeed, Green’s films do not fully embrace the flourishing culture
  supposedly affirmed through his depiction of rituals; instead, these films
  manage to subvert the same traditions that they portray, a feat most frequently
  accomplished through music.</p>
  <p>In this paper, I analyze a number of ritual moments in Green’s films through
  the lens of Ruth HaCohen and Sander Gilman’s work on the Jewish noise
  complaint, an understanding of Jewish vocality as inferior to Western
  (Christian) music, which the scholars trace from the Gospels of Mark and
  Matthew through the twentieth century. I argue that it is precisely the use of
  sound and music during ritual moments in Green’s films that suggests an
  awareness not only about the act of performing Jewish identity, but also
  specifically about how performing Jewish identity sounds. The intersecting
  musical, dramatic, and geographic narratives in these films privilege the
  progression from noisy Jewish folk music to polished Western harmony; as a
  result, the fates of the characters most closely tied to Jewish musical
  traditions lie invariably somewhere out in the Western world. Ultimately
  Green’s films demonstrate that, even in a Yiddish world that existed solely for
  its audience, the sounds of Jewish identity are not immune from the need to
  conform to the standards of Western (Christian) music. </p>
