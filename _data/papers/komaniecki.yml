    <p>When analyzing rap music, vocal pitch is likely not the first parameter
    one considers. Indeed, one of the defining aspects of the rap genre is its
    tendency to eschew the precisely-pitched vocals heard in nearly all other
    popular music. However, there are countless examples of rap tracks in
    which MCs are consciously pitching their vocals using a variety of
    techniques, emphasizing pitch in a way that paradoxically seems at odds
    with one of the very defining characteristics of rap music.</p>
    <p>In this presentation, I contend that pitch plays an important role in
    the structure and delivery of rap flows. I demonstrate the ways in which
    rappers manipulate pitch to create a structural parameter that can operate
    independently from or in tandem with rhythm and rhyme. Furthermore, I
    argue that pitched vocals take a wider array of forms in rap music than in
    other genres of popular music, ranging from carefully-pitched singing of
    modern rap flows to the imprecise and exaggerated declamatory features of
    speech that distinguished rap from other genres during its formative
    years. I assert that all rap flows can be classified as using pitch in one
    of five different ways, with each technique carrying its own unique set of
    analytical implications.</p>
