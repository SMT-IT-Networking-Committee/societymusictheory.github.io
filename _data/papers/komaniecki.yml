title: Analyzing Collaborative Flow in Rap Music
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>The “guest artist” is a ubiquitous feature of contemporary rap music.
    In fact, each of the top ten best-selling rap albums of 2015 featured
    multiple appearances from guest rappers, despite each being released under
    the name of a solo artist. In recent years, rap music has been subjected
    to a steadily-increasing number of analytical inquiries, spearheaded by
    scholars such as Krims, Adams, Williams, and Ohriner. In this
    presentation, I expand upon Adams’s “metrical techniques of flow”
    (essentially, all aspects of a rapper’s delivery that can be readily
    notated or measured) in order to demonstrate the quantifiable impact that
    a lead rapper can have on his or her guest artists.</p>

    <p>Transcriptions and analyses of rap tracks featuring guest artists
    elucidate the ways in which a lead rapper’s delivery shapes that of their
    guest. Various aspects of flow—such as rhythmic cells, rhyme scheme, and
    end-rhyme technique—are imposed upon guest rappers. In rare cases, a guest
    artist will not only appropriate aspects of the lead rapper’s flow, but
    contribute their own developments as well.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, I demonstrate ways in which the influence of a
    track’s main rapper can be heard on his or her featured artists—including
    intra-track cohesion between rhyme schemes, rhythmic cells, and use of
    multi-syllabic rhymes. Through this analysis, we can not only uncover
    quantifiable aspects of individual rappers’ characteristic styles, but
    also develop a deeper understanding of musical depictions of collaboration
    and identity in rap music.</p>
