    <p>This paper considers tonal narrative, and its relationship to what Ewell (2020) describes as music’s “white racial frame,” in Florence Price’s Piano Sonata in E Minor (1932). While Brown (1997) describes the sonata as being “in the Romantic tradition,” Price’s harmonic language is often subtly idiosyncratic to the Romantic style. This paper highlights one of these idiosyncrasies, which I have termed <em>non-harmonic persistence</em>: cases wherein inflections of locally non-harmonic pitches—particularly܁ć—undermine conventional tonal hierarchies by treating its relation to Ć as hierarchically undefined (c.f. Harrison 1994; Doll 2017).</p>
    <p>Traditionally, tonal narrative strategies often invoke the concept of “heroic overcoming” (Straus 2011), which manifests through normalizing traditional tonal structures while treating elements outside those structures—such as these idiosyncratic, anti-hierarchic, uses of ć —as problems to be subdued (Almén 2008). Such narratives centralize eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European values, a “white worldview [encompassing] persisting. . .racial prejudices, ideologies, interpretations and narratives” (Feagin [2009] 2013). Rather than interpreting Price’s harmonic idiosyncrasies within this framework, I propose instead that the resistance to structural integration demonstrated by ć reflects a non-Eurocentric narrative consistent with Price’s personal experiences: an outsider searching for an equal place within a hierarchy designed to exclude all but certain privileged elements. </p>
    <p>Ultimately, dismantling music’s white racial frame involves considering different narratives; adopting dialogic models of tonal narrative (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006) decentralizes traditional Eurocentric ideologies, and engages the cultural contexts in which a non-white composer lived as a framework for reflection on how idiosyncratic styles interact with conventional tonal structures.</p>
