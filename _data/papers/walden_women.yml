abstract: |
  <p>The varied career of Johanna Kinkel (b. 1810, Bonn; d. 1858, London)
  spanned Europe and disparate fields, but was laser focused on a single
  principle: “emancipation.” As novelist, activist, pianist, composer, and
  theorist, Kinkel uncovered common strands linking political oppression to the
  formal constraints of harmonic theory; her treatises suggested a
  reinterpretation of the history of theory as radically reimaginative in a
  musical context as the writings of her associate Karl Marx.  She argued that
  the discrete pitches of the tempered scale locked musicians into a
  hierarchical system fundamentally opposed to the continuous sonic fluctuations
  of the natural environment epitomized in the sounds of water and wind.  She
  called on musicians to liberate the smallest “Klang-Atome” to take on an equal
  role in supporting musical structures.  The “mother’s milk” that would sustain
  composers in their quest towards the harmonies of the spheres was
  microtonalism, <i>not</i> a diatonicism historically associated with
  masculinity, order, and strength.</p>
  <p>I weave together Kinkel’s theoretical arguments with insights from her
  personal and professional history, political articles for the <i>Neue Bonner
  Zeitung </i>(1846–48), her story “Musical Orthodoxy” (1844–48), and the
  reception of her work to uncover what her unabashedly feminist theory of music
  can teach us today.  </p>
