    <p>Finessing Janet Schmalfeldt’s (2011) dialectical formulation of
    “becoming” (captured by ⇒), Nathan Martin and Steven Vande Moortele (2014)
    propose a more specific distinction between two heterogeneous cases of
    form-functional transformation. The first describes a condition of
    form-functional oscillation (symbolized as ⇔); the second alludes to the
    possibility of form-functional regression (represented by ⇐), by which
    they intend the syntactic reversion of form-functional profile (e.g.
    subordinate theme⇐codetta). Such a syntax-based understanding, however,
    obscures a different dialectical situation and form-functional scenario
    inherent in the notion of regression: the entire formal unit displays a
    form-functional conflict that regresses to its initial profile at a higher
    formal-hierarchical level—a case that is significant in two-dimensional
    sonata form (Vande Moortele 2009).</p>
    <p>This paper recalibrates current accounts of form-functional becoming and
    oscillation in explicitly dialectical terms and postulates regression as a
    form-functional scenario drawing upon Heidegger’s ontology (1927), a relation
    demonstrated via an analysis of Strauss’s <i>Eine Alpensinfonie</i> (1915). I
    argue that while becoming and oscillation display respectively an Adornian
    negative dialectic (1966) and a Hegelian dialectic (1817), regression
    otherwise exhibits a local form-functional becoming or oscillation that is
    retrospectively reinterpreted as its original profile at an overarching level
    in two-dimensional sonata form, attesting to Heidegger’s existential analytic
    of <i>Dasein</i>. Such a situation is exemplified through “Eintritt in den
    Wald,” where the advent of a PAC forces regression and exposes the
    epistemological precedence of the subject. This formulation consequently leads
    to a taxonomy of form-functional transformation, which lays the foundation for
    a post-Romantic functional-transformational formal theory.</p>
