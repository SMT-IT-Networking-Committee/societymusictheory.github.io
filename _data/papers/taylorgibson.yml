abstract: |
  <p>The Greek heroine was a popular subject in twentieth-century art and music;
  among the most famous depictions are found in Jean Cocteau’s re-stagings of
  <i>Oedipus Rex</i> and <i>Antigone</i> and Martha Graham’s mythic dances of the
  1940s (e.g. Hindemith’s <i>Hérodiade</i> (1944), Menotti’s <i>Errand into the
  Maze</i> (1947), Schumann’s <i>Night Journey</i> (1947)). While “Neoclassical”
  in subject matter, the Cocteau and Graham approaches are radically
  different—one inserts modern political ruminations into Sophocles to
  demonstrate the value of calm deliberation and another joins the psychoanalytic
  theories of Freud and Jung with ancient story lines to evoke sympathy for
  aberrant female behavior. These distant branches of the Neoclassical tree are
  united in an understudied work within the Graham repertory: Carlos Chávez’s
  <i>Dark Meadow</i>. </p>
  <p>Commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge in 1942 as a pair to Aaron
  Copland’s <i>Appalachian Spring</i> (1944), <i>Dark Meadow</i> was originally
  intended to be a meditation on the myth of Medea. As detailed in this paper,
  however, collaborative difficulties plagued Chávez’s work, resulting in a
  delayed 1946 premiere. At least some of the conflict revolved around Graham’s
  expression of “joy” in listening to Chávez’s <i>Sinfonía Antígona</i>—a
  reaction the composer logically interpreted as a suggestion to extend the
  Baroque figuration and emotional reserve found in that work to the new project.
  Such an approach disregarded Graham’s taste for psychoanalytic drama punctuated
  by theatric pauses. As a result, she found herself rejecting the intended Medea
  theme and composing a “dance counterpoint.” As a result, critics called the
  work “obscure” and “abstract.” </p>
  <p>Close study of <i>Dark Meadow</i> and the influences behind its creation
  suggest that the collaborators’ ethnic and gender identities combined with
  unacknowledged bias to frustrate their working process. The implications of
  these disconnects extend beyond one work; they allow us to rethink Hess’s
  “Ur-Classicism” in a messier post-war context using Judith Butler’s ideas about
  the policing of female sexuality, Hannah Kostrin’s study of Mexican dance
  politics, Leonora Saavedra’s post-colonial reading of Chávez, and my own
  examination of the relevant primary source material. </p>
