abstract: |
  <p>The glee reached the height of its popularity during the 1780s and 90s in
  London, primarily due to its marketing to middle-class amateur musicians,
  especially women. A few decades prior, however, this genre was generally
  associated with professional composers and aristocratic associations. Elite
  all-male vocal clubs such as the Noblemen and Gentlemen’s Catch Club, which
  counted among its members prestigious composers such as Thomas Arne, Benjamin
  Cooke, and Samuel Webbe as well as wealthy gentlemen including the Earl of
  Sandwich and the Prince of Wales (later George IV), had been responsible for
  the genre’s revival as a worthy successor to the partsongs of Tallis, Morley,
  and Purcell. As vocal clubs sought the cultural elevation of the glee, they
  also took advantage of London’s burgeoning music market to broaden the genre’s
  potential consumer base.</p>
  <p>Viewing the glee as a genre that undergoes a transformation from highbrow to
  middlebrow status during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
  illuminates significant changes in its performance practice, reception, and
  representations of Englishness and masculinity. The twin poles of aristocratic
  legitimacy and consumerism embedded within glee culture resulted in blurred
  distinctions between professional/amateur and private/public. Drawing on the
  work of Joan Rubin and Kathleen Wilson, I argue that middlebrow theory, though
  rooted in twentieth-century cultural practices, can clarify the interactions
  between class, capitalism, and culture in Georgian music. Developments in glee
  performance practices prioritized accessibility for a wide audience, including
  standardized cleffing in which all vocal parts except the bass were notated in
  treble clef, and the addition of piano accompaniment parts to what was
  initially an a cappella practice. Well-known composers of glees such as John
  Wall Callcott published reharmonizations of earlier glees, simplified for
  amateur singers. These techniques brought greater cultural visibility to the
  glee among contemporary performers and audiences, but nineteenth-century
  critics argued that the genre’s perceived amateurization caused a decline in
  artistic quality. The glee’s substantial renovation anticipates the dynamics of
  class and cultural hierarchy underpinning twentieth-century middlebrow
  music.</p>
