abstract: |
  <p>Heinrich Schenker and August Halm maintained a lively correspondence. They
  debated sonata form, improvisation, and genius in music; argued over the
  aesthetic value of compositions by Brahms and Bruckner; and expressed profound
  disagreement regarding European politics after the Great War. This paper
  explores how Schenker’s correspondence with Halm relates to his published
  writings from the mid-1920s, including essays in<i> Das Meisterwerk in der
  Musik, </i>vols. I and II (1925–26).</p>
  <p>After establishing connections between the Schenker-Halm correspondence and
  Schenker’s contemporaneous publications, I suggest the juxtaposition of “On
  Organicism in Sonata Form” and “The Organic Nature of Fugue” in <i>Meisterwerk
  II</i> is meant as a response to Halm’s <i>Von zwei Kulturen der Musik
  </i>(1913). In this pair of essays Schenker subsumes Halm’s two musical
  cultures, fugue and sonata, within a monoculture of organicism (Hooper 2017).
  This impulse toward monism, a hallmark of later work, is inspired by
  Schenker’s monotheistic religious beliefs, which he also reveals in a letter
  to Halm, writing, “All religious feeling . . . urges toward the briefest
  formulation of the world, and a similar religious tendency allows me to hear a
  piece of music as ‘figuration’ of a kernel” (Bent, Bretherton, and Drabkin
  2014, 283). Yet Halm is not convinced, replying, “the foreground, or surface,
  has been neglected at the expense of the background and foundation,
  corporality at the expense of spirituality” (289; see Rothfarb 2005). Perhaps
  healthy skepticism expressed by a respected musician prompted Schenker to
  refine his theories all the more.</p>
