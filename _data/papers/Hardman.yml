    <p>This paper explores a text-music phenomenon, that I call <em>vocal backbeat,</em> which is used as a text painting device in much recent mainstream country music. Vocal backbeat occurs when phonetic accents and/or rhyming words appear on beats 2 and 4 of a 4/4 meter. In these vocal backbeats, beats 2 and 4 are also performatively stronger through phenomenal accents, including durational, dynamic, and/or pitch accents. </p>
    <p>Vocal backbeat is often used as a text painting device in recent mainstream country music in order to create a sense of tension. In sections with vocal backbeat, there is a divorce between the phenomenal accents in the vocals and the conventional metric accents in the guitars and keyboards. Drawing on recent work on metric dissonance, text-music relationships, and positional listening (Attas 2015, Biamonte 2014, Covach 2020, Samarotto 1999, and Malawey 2020, among others), I suggest that, within the singer’s part, the backbeat feels like the strongest of the four beats, subverting our expectations of 4/4 meter. The tension between the parts usually accompanies a conflict in the song’s narrative. Once the conflict resolves in the lyrics, the patterns of accent in the vocals, guitars and keyboards reconcile as well. This paper will include analyses of songs by Carrie Underwood, Kane Brown, Eric Church, Jason Aldean, and Emerson Drive.</p>
