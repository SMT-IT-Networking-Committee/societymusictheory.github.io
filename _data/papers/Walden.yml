    <p>This talk examines how the epistemological and ontological formations of modern colonialism shaped Western academic conceptions of pitch and pitch space.  I start by tracing how comparative musicologists (Ellis 1885), musical psychologists (Stumpf/Hornbostel 1911), and music theorists (Fétis 1860–1865, Riemann 1914) relied upon epistemologies of “pitch fundamentalism” that automatically identified tones by their fundamental frequencies alone, and transferred the responsibility for recognizing those fundamentals to mechanical instruments.  Building on insights from political theory and anthropology that reveal how the conceptualization of geographical space as homogenous, empty, and absolute was leveraged for colonial governance (Mitchell 2000 et al.), I argue that the <em>spatialization</em> of pitch through diagrammatic techniques such as the <em>Tonnetz</em> (Euler 1739, Oettingen 1866, Tanaka 1890, Khare 1921) afforded acts of quantification, quantization, and commensuration that drew on the statistical instruments of empire, and justified re-drawing cultural, ethnic, and racial borders.  The dynamics of pitch fundamentalism and spatialization, I suggest, have locked the past century and a half of pitch studies into the continual reiteration of two temporal frameworks: unilinear developmentalism and cultural relativism (Scherzinger 2017). The former leads to the homogenous and infinitely extensive plane of the just-intonation Tonnetz; the latter leads to “non-Western Tonnetze” (e.g. Khare 1921, Tenzer 2000) and the equal-tempered torus that has captivated Neo-Riemannian and transformational scholarship for the past three decades. The lessons of radical geography and Indigenous studies (Chen 2010, Robinson 2019), however, suggest that the work of decolonialism will require us to develop new ways for conceptualizing pitch.</p>
