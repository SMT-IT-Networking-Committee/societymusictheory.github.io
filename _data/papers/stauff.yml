abstract: |
  <p>In previously unrecognized ways, early modern Lutheran music raises themes
  associated with the ongoing religious conflict in central Europe. The most
  obvious examples were performed at religiously polarizing events, like
  Reformation festivals, or they include overtly confessional language, like the
  hymn <i>Erhalt uns her</i>. But Lutheran composers could also bring up
  religious conflict in another way: by evoking religious exile. Over the past
  decades, historians have begun to gauge the social, political, and economic
  repercussions brought on by several waves of Protestant refugees, most notably
  those fleeing the Counter-Reformation in Habsburg lands. These refugees, I
  argue, also left their imprint on the music and musical institutions of
  central Germany into the eighteenth century. After all, prominent Lutheran
  composers like Andreas Hammerschmidt and Stephan Otto were themselves refugees
  and worked for networks of exiled patrons.</p>
  <p>Regardless of personal experience as migrants, composers allude to exile in
  several ways. First, from Isaac to Bach, composers set texts with the word
  “Elend.” In early modern German, “Elend” not only signified misery and
  suffering, as usually translated, but also could mean exile. The word
  frequently appears in Lutheran music, and in some instances (like Bach’s
  cantatas 39 and 75) the older meaning adds confessional significance. Second,
  composers set texts whose original biblical context could be linked to exile.
  Some of these passages figure prominently in Lutheran devotional literature
  directed at refugees. Apart from obvious examples like Psalm 137, exile comes
  up in Schütz’s “Auf dem Gebirge” (from <i>Geistliche Chor-Musik</i>), a
  setting of words from Matthew 2, which the evangelist took from Jeremiah 31.
  Both chapters connect to exile. Third, in print, composers introduced
  iconography evoking the topic. The frontispiece to Hammerschmidt’s
  <i>Dialogi</i> (1645), for instance, shows Manasseh, the exiled king of Judah,
  who repented and returned home. The engraving thereby encourages readers to
  link Hammerschmidt’s music to exile and hope for return. Lutherans may have
  valued these texts and images because of confessional migration. Just as they
  cultivated devotional literature for refugees, so they harnessed sacred music
  to comfort migrants, encourage the goodwill of locals, or honor patrons for
  their charity.</p>
