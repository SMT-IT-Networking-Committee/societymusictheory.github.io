  <p>The story of Jacques Champion de Chambonnières’ refusal to play <i>basso
  continuo</i> under Lully’s direction has come to symbolize the fraught musical
  politics of seventeenth-century France: the schism between the disavowed
  musicians of Chambonnières’ generation and the new milieu based in Versailles;
  the tense interactions between city and court; and the oppositions between
  keyboard and operatic cultures. Studies of French harpsichord culture have
  focused primarily on Parisian patrons and salons as the supposed inverse of
  Versailles-based music and spectacle, but relatively few have concentrated on
  the influence of the urban environment on the development of French
  harpsichords. Nonetheless the harpsichord was primarily an instrument of the
  city—and the city itself left traces on its repertoire.</p>
  <p>Professional harpsichord makers and harpsichordists of the seventeenth and
  eighteenth centuries lived in close proximity, mostly in the history-laden
  Quartier Saint-Merry in Paris. Located just east of Châtelet, this densely
  populated medieval neighborhood was home to painters, decorators, tapestry
  weavers, and woodworkers, many of whom were involved in harpsichord
  production. Essential to understanding the bonds between artisans,
  instruments, and musicians, both professional and amateur, is the idea of a
  <i>communauté</i>—meaning a guild, a society, a neighborhood, a religious
  community, and even a legal partnership.</p>
  <p>Harpsichord production depended on a vast network of contacts established
  through family, guilds, and geographical proximity. The close ties between
  building dynasties, musical families, and foreign and French artisans
  elucidates the fundamental urban identity of the harpsichord in Paris in the
  eighteenth century. These relationships can be better understood by
  considering the complicated politics of the Denis family, a major dynasty of
  harpsichord makers, and the 1745 <i>ravalement</i> and redecoration of a 1632
  Ioannes Ruckers harpsichord, now at the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire in
  Neuchâtel, Switzerland.</p>
  <p>This paper examines some of the ways in which harpsichord-making, so
  integrated into the economic and social <i>vie de quartier</i>, directly
  shaped the way Parisian harpsichordists—as composers, teachers, and
  performers—approached the instrument and cultivated a musical style that could
  be as complex as the relationships that united these <i>communautés</i>.</p>
