title: Hindemith’s Harmonic Fluctuation and Obscured Tonality in Satie’s Nocturnes

abstract: |
    <p>To accommodate the elaborations of harmony and tonality that
    characterized many twentieth-century musical styles, Paul Hindemith
    (1895-1963) stated that it is not the scalar context of chord roots that
    initiate tonality, but rather the juxtaposition of the chords’ constituent
    intervals (Hindemith 1942). As part of his compositional practice, he
    devised a system of measuring dissonance and tonal force in harmonies,
    classifying them by intervallic content into six groups of graduating
    dissonance while discounting the scalar context of the chords’ roots. He
    coined the term <i>harmonic fluctuation</i> for varying levels of
    dissonance between adjacent harmonies. Recent analyses employing harmonic
    fluctuation (Harrison 2016) show that it can be an important component, if
    not the main component in the analysis of many post-tonal styles, being
    adaptable to many musical contexts.</p>

    <p>Intervals also played a key role in Erik Satie’s composition of his
    <i>Nocturnes</i> (1919)<i> </i>for solo piano. Satie departed from his
    practice of parodying earlier styles and shifted to a more serious
    compositional style in the <i>Nocturnes</i> by largely abandoning
    functional harmony and systematically using intervals as the basis for his
    harmonic language, and this is evident in the works’ sketches. Taking into
    account the favoring of intervals in both Hindemith’s and Satie’s
    construction methods, this study will trace the evolution of Satie’s use
    of chromaticism and obscured tonality in his <i>Nocturnes</i> by utilizing
    harmonic fluctuation.</p>
