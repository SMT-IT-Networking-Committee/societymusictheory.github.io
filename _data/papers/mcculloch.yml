abstract: |
    <p>On October 12, 1950, Dmitri Shostakovich began a chorale sketch of his
    Prelude in A minor, the second prelude from the 24 Preludes and Fugues. The
    work was later reviewed in March 1951 by the Symphonic and Chamber Music
    subcommittee of the Composers’ Union and was temporarily barred from
    publication. Even the work’s harshest critics, however, could not detect a
    trace of contradiction or controversy within this prelude. Shostakovich’s
    sketch of the prelude, however, reveals a number of voice-leading,
    reduction, and prolongation conundrums, suggesting that the harmony is more
    ambiguous than a cursory glance would suggest.</p>
    <p>Shostakovich the analyst challenges several criteria of reduction,
    necessitating a few revisions in orthodox reduction practice. To begin
    with, the sketch employs an inconsistent number of voices. I contend that
    those instances in which Shostakovich reduced the texture from five to
    three voices are indicative of registral expansion and contraction within a
    phrase. Unlike orthodox reduction practice where register is of secondary
    importance, registral expansion and contraction are fundamental devices the
    composer used in this sketch. Furthermore, I reevaluate some ineffective
    criteria for determining chord tones motivated by the dissonant figuration
    in the score. While some dissonances are straight forward, such as the
    dual-natured passing tone/neighbor tone in the first bar, many others are
    more ambiguous (Dolzhansky 1963). I provide two instances in which
    Shostakovich’s reduction deviates from my own to suggest that chord tones
    can be established based on voice-leading parsimony and patterning of
    voicings in the context of the phrase.</p>
