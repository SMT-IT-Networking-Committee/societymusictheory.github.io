  <p>Although the academic study of digital music production has embraced a
  variety of approaches—including histories of technological change,
  ethnographies of the music industry, and biographies of record
  producers—scholarship has yet to deal with shifting trends in music software
  and digital instrument design. In the past thirty years, software for record
  production has often been modeled as a virtual simulation of the “analog”
  studio, with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) simulating mixing boards and
  tape editing tools, and virtual instruments modeled after acoustic
  instruments. Yet, with the rise of “smart” media and the increasing
  mobilization of digital music making, ideas regarding the function of the
  studio—and the performance practices contained within it—continue to change.
  Most noticeably, tools for music production have become increasingly
  influenced by—and integrated within—tools across digital media, from film
  editing to video game design. Integrating my experience as a sound designer
  and music producer with theoretical frameworks regarding sonic ontology from
  sound studies, science and technology studies, and the “musicology of record
  production” (Frith and Zagorski-Thomas, 2013), this paper illustrates the
  evolving ecology of music software design in the context of new methods for
  the contextualization and conceptualization of sound and media technologies.

  <p>First, I detail the emergence of what media theorist Henry Jenkins terms
  “convergence” media, focusing specifically on the integration of multimedia
  practices into the evolution of music production software. Then, through a
  demonstration of the popular digital audio workstation (DAW) Ableton
  <i>Live</i>, as well as an analysis of production techniques from electronic
  dance music producer Rustie’s seminal album, <i>Glass Swords</i> (2011), I
  argue for an approach to the study of digital music production that deals with
  the broad ecology of current media practices: from the haptic, multimodal
  engagement of games and touch-screen technologies, to the non-linear visual
  editing practices of film production. Unlike the previous generation’s
  industry standard software, Avid’s <i>Pro Tools</i>, <i>Live</i> abandons
  traditional studio practices, eschewing long-held metaphors for musical
  inscription such as the vinyl record and magnetic tape, and instead presents
  the producer with a modular interface designed for a more performative micro
  editing and real-time recombination of sonic materials.</p>
