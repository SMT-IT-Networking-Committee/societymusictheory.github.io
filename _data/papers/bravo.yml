abstract: |
  <p>In a diary entry from 1918, the composer Erwin Schulhoff, having returned
  from military service in the Austrian Army to face the grim political and
  social realities that were a legacy of the war, identified himself as the
  Wandering Jew when he wrote, “I now begin the eternally desolate life of
  Ahasuerus.” The theme of a deathly tired hero condemned to roam the earth
  until Judgment Day must have resonated deeply with the young soldier Schulhoff
  who returned to an uncertain future in Prague after four years on the front
  lines where he had been wounded twice and suffered from nerve damage. The
  conception of immortality as eternal punishment, central to the legend of
  Ahasuerus, not only suggests the despair characterizing Schulhoff’s outlook
  after World War I, but it also provides the thematic backdrop of his 1929
  opera<i> Flammen: eine musikalische Tragikomödie in zwei Akten zu zehn
  Bildern</i>. Nowhere in his <i>oeuvre</i> is the hopelessness and collective
  trauma of the post-World War I context more powerfully articulated than in
  this work. </p>
  <p>The opera features a jazz-dancing, twentieth-century Don Juan in his erotic
  encounter with La Morte, which unfolds in ten loosely related “pictures”
  constructed on the aesthetic principles of cinematic montage. In a radical
  departure from the original ending of the Don Juan legend, where the
  protagonist is sentenced to eternal damnation and death, Schulhoff’s opera
  “concludes” when his twentieth-century Don Juan is sentenced to eternal life
  as the work’s opening “Notturno” returns at the conclusion, musically
  circumscribing him within its closed formal telos and his fate. Drawing on
  Schulhoff’s diaries and critical writings, my paper examines the large-scale
  formal and determined structure of the opera as a basis for raising
  fundamental questions about the work of art in the context of modernity as
  well to explore the contested place of Jewish-German intellectuals and artists
  in the post-World War I culture of Prague to which Schulhoff belonged. </p>
