abstract: |
    <p>Johannes Lippius is best known for his path-breaking articulation of
    the concept of the triad.  The reception of this innovation chiefly relies
    upon his treatise <i>Synopsis novae musicae</i>, despite the fact that
    Lippius had already published many of this book’s notable points in
    earlier texts, which he called “disputations on music.”  Yet the
    genre-specific peculiarities of the <i>disputatio</i>, which was a
    university-based event featuring a lecturer and a respondent who attempted
    to rebut the lecturer's ideas, have been overlooked in previous studies of
    Lippius's music-theoretical content.  By situating his writings within the
    university system of the day and the formalized genres in which he wrote,
    this paper reveals an important instance of how music theory has been
    shaped by the demands of audience and genre.</p>

    <p>Through comparison of how Lippius presented material first in the form
    of disputations and then reworked it for publication in his treatise, this
    paper reveals finds that some textual features are clearly attributable to
    generic demands, such as the disputations’ frequent appeals to authorities
    and the treatise’s adoption of an organizational framework which was
    heavily indebted to the pedagogical theories of Johann Sturm.  It also
    casts light on unexpected aspects of those genres, like Lippius’s
    expectation that readers of his introductory musical treatise could
    comprehend both Latin and Greek.  Further discrepancies between the texts
    offer tantalizing glimpses of how the oral disputation may have encouraged
    Lippius to clarify his ideas, particularly in his recasting of the analogy
    between the triad and the trinity.</p>
