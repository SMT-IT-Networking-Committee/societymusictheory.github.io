abstract: | 
    <p>A growing collection of scholarship by Noriko Manabe, Robert Komaniecki, myself, and others analyzes pitch organization in the rapping voice using methods from both music theory and intonational phonology. One principle of the latter is that syllables carrying linguistic “focus”—that is, new, non-derivable information—tend to be higher in pitch. Another principle of intonational phonology, termed “declination,” holds that spoken utterances (not unlike sung melodies) tend to decline in pitch. One prominent poetic schema in rap lyrics, the anaphora—that is, several utterances that begin with the same words—pits these two principles against each other. In an anaphora, the novel text carries linguistic focus and competes with tendencies towards declination.</p>
    <p>I determine through a corpus study of performed anaphoras that focus usually “wins” over declination in hip-hop vocal delivery. Having documented the tendencies of “unmarked” focal accents in anaphoric delivery, I analyze three examples of anaphoric delivery with “anti-focal” accents, utterances that descend in pitch despite linguistic focus towards the end, in performances by Mos Def, Kendrick Lamar, and the poet Najee Omar. In my readings, anti-focal accentuation is a marked performance practice that bolsters assertions of individuality and autonomy. Ultimately, I have three aims in sharing this work: continuing to explore aspects of pitch organization in the rapping voice, drawing hip-hop vocal delivery into musical considerations of schema theory, and presenting analytical methods that can accommodate a variety of recited, rapped, and sung Black vocal practices.</p>
