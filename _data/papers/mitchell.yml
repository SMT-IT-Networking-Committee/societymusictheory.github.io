    <p>“Se cerca, se dice,” the climactic aria from Metastasio’s <em>L’Olimpiade</em> (1733), was a centerpiece of galant culture. For nearly sixty years, this text inspired over seventy compositions by dozens of the century’s most celebrated composers. Moreover, the aria’s many settings share a striking number of features, as though each sketched a common subject from a unique perspective. These conventions affected compositional decisions on multiple levels of structure including global features like an E-flat major tonal color and a distinctive multi-tempo form as well as a roster of aria-specific schemas on the foreground. “Se cerca” was thus the catalyst for a rich musical tradition structured by its own dialogic network and generic constraints. In contrast to the style-wide, intergeneric conventions addressed by modern-day <em>Formenlehre</em> and schema theory, the “Se cerca” tradition provides an unprecedented look at the largely overlooked situation-specific pressures that animate the galant style.</p>
    <p>This paper examines the kind of knowledge required to compose a “Se cerca, se dice,” drawing on a corpus study of fifty core settings of the text. Building on recent research into the cognition of musical form (Byros 2015), I model the aria’s many replicated features as a “script” (Schank &amp; Abelson 1977)—essentially a cognitive schema capturing “how a ‘Se cerca’ goes.” A focused analysis of the opening stanza highlights shared features such as a “Sol-Fa-Mi” opening plan, specialized punctuation schemas, and orchestral interjection prolonging the cadential progression. The broad shape of the second stanza unfolds as a brief transitional space followed by an antiphonal second theme built around the Fenaroli schema and concluding with a modally collapsed cadential zone. Finally, the fast-tempo third stanza emphasizes vocal pedal points on G5 accompanied by energetic schemas such as the Pulcinella Cadence, as well as text recall from the preceding recitative, among other effects. The “Se cerca” tradition thus offers a window into the manifold intertexts that shape compositional acts in the eighteenth-century, encouraging future research that supplements our existing repertoire of style-wide formal types (sonata, period, sentence, etc.) with the characteristic scripts of specific genres.</p>
