abstract: |
    <p>In this paper, I explore a pre-cadential schema in galant style that I
    call the Volta. The Volta features four events grouped into two stages: stage
    one charges up the dominant via #4-5, while stage two releases to the tonic
    via 4-3.Â  After introducing the Volta and its common variants, I define its
    characteristic pre-cadential formal function and explore its semantic range
    within Metastasian da capo aria. The schema enjoyed greatest currency during
    the 1730s, but remained an active member of the musical discourse through the
    century's end. I illustrate the Volta's role in eighteenth-century style with
    representative excerpts from Vinci, Pergolesi, Hasse, Galuppi, Haydn, and
    Mozart.</p>
