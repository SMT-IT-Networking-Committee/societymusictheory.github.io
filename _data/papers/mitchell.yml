abstract: |
    <p>Bill Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues" is a signature item in the bluegrass
    canon. Indeed, Monroe himself claims to have discovered the essence of
    bluegrass rhythm in this old Jimmie Rodgers tune. And yet, the song stands
    in sharp contrast to the metrical and hypermetrical norms that shaped
    bluegrass music as it developed in the 1950s and ’60s, eschewing regular
    four-bar hypermeter in favor of a highly irregular phrase structure with
    seemingly indeterminate downbeats. This paper offers an analysis of
    Monroe’s “Muleskinner Blues” conducted with an eye toward its fluid
    approach to meter. I show how the song’s metrical structure, embodied in
    the group actions of the Blue Grass Boys, responds flexibly to Bill
    Monroe’s extended vocal expressions. In so doing, my analysis highlights
    the musical events that forecast impending harmonic changes, providing key
    insight into the “cueing systems” (Gupta 2017) that hold together such
    improvisatory musical spaces. The paper thus supplements existing studies
    on style-wide systems of licks and progression schemes (Adler 1974; Stoia
    2013) required for successful bluegrass picking, arguing that a Blue Grass
    Boy would additionally require song-specific schemas to facilitate quick
    musical responses in a constrained yet flexible musical environment.</p>
