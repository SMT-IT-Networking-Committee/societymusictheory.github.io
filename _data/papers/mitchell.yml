abstract: |
  <p>In the preface to his 1756 revision of <i>Statira</i>, Carlo Goldoni lays
  bare the aesthetic aims of his comedic reform. “My plain and sincere hope is
  for compassion in comedic prose or verse and, by rising to the seriousness of
  the heroic, I see myself taking the first steps.” The pastoral mode provided
  poets and composers alike a powerful point of contact between “heroic” and
  “comedic” registers. One striking example is “Che piacer, che bel diletto,”
  the opening aria from Goldoni’s most successful libretto, <i>La buona
  figliuola</i>, as set by Niccolò Piccinni in 1760. As the curtain rises,
  Cecchina—the opera’s heroine—glides onto the stage to a lilting minuet,
  reveling in the sensuous beauty of flowers alight in the morning dew. Although
  analysts have universally acknowledged the pastoral simplicity of Cecchina’s
  music, they have reached diverging conclusions as to the musical register such
  a feature encodes: whether <i>parti buffe</i> (Head, 2014), <i>parti serie</i>
  (Hunter, 1985), or <i>mezzo di carattere</i> (Castelvecchi, 2013). </p>
  <p>I argue that such confusion results from inadequate attention to the
  affective conventions of <i>opera seria</i> as a shaping force for <i>opera
  buffa’s</i> serious characters. To bring greater focus to this issue, I
  address the following question: to what extent is “Che piacer” musically
  plausible as an aria in <i>opera seria</i>? I first construct a dialogic
  network consisting of contemporaneous Metastasian arias that share “Che
  piacer’s” dramatic function, poetic imagery, or metrical/topical profile. I
  then treat two arias form this network to extended analysis; “Intendo amico
  rio,” the introductory aria from Piccinni’s <i>Il re pastore</i> (1760), and
  “Quell’amor che poco accende,” a minuet aria on a floral subject from Johann
  Christian Bach’s <i>Catone in Utica</i> (1761). The common affective sphere
  inhabited by these arias sets into relief their distinctive musical actions;
  such as the virtuosic vocal mannerisms in Piccinni’s “Intendo amico rio” or
  Bach’s elevated lexicon of galant phrase schemas (Gjerdingen, 2007). I
  conclude by defining Cecchina’s musical register as a “domestication” of the
  <i>seria</i> aesthetic, repurposing and distilling the sensuous pastoral mode
  into a language of polished yet unaffected sensibility.</p>
