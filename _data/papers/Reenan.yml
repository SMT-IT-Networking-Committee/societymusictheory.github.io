    <p>This presentation deconstructs contemporary notions of musical form by reexamining two commonly held paradigms: that form is necessarily hierarchical, and that formal procedures abide by historically inscribed standards of normativity. Endemic to North American theories of musical form is the notion that western art music is organized hierarchically. In the context of music theoretical thought, hierarchies are regulative. For example, in Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) <em>Elements of Sonata Theory</em>, the authority of socially reified musical structures underpins an analytical project focused on transgressions. <em>Sonata Theory</em>’s adherence to a uniformity of practice calls to mind Butler’s (1990) “frameworks of intelligibility,” as certain forms are deemed more or less “available” in a given generic context. Such a conception of musical form promotes normativity rather than, as in Straus’s (2018) adaptation of disability studies to music, drawing on deviations “as a valuable source of new kinds of musical combinations and musical eﬀects” (3). As a form of musicological “surveillance,” to borrow a concept from Browne (2015), the maintenance of a catalog of classical norms only serves to reinforce the boundaries between the white, male “masterworks” and the Other. I reimagine hierarchy and standard along the lines of embodiment and phenomenology. Following Ngo (2016), I consider the active mode a listener-analyst can adopt in (re-)defining sedimented expectations. Reversing the usual paradigm of a passive transfer of ritualized responses, Ngo suggests that the reified norms and expectations of a receiving body are subject to change by actively challenging those very structures.</p>
