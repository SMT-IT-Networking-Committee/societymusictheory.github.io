title: The Teaching and Practice of Improvised Counterpoint in the Renaissance
handout: ''
abstract: |
    <p>Oral counterpoint, currently known as <i>cantare super librum</i>, was
    widely taught and practiced within the choirs and chapels of many European
    churches throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. But how did the singers
    learn to sing in counterpoint, and what did their improvisations look
    like, when compared with the written-out compositions we have preserved
    from the same period? To answer these questions, I will interpret a number
    of treatises that explain the teaching methods and didactic progression,
    as well as the techniques employed by the musicians to realize their
    counterpoints “in real time.” I will focus on the works of Coclico,
    Lusitano, and Zarlino, and I will also use some historical evidence,
    particularly the statement given by Correa de Arauxo in his fascinating
    letter of 1637.</p>
