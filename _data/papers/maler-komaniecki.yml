    <p>The art of “song signing” involves the use of rhythmicized signs from a signed language, such as American Sign Language (ASL), in a musical context. Song signing encompasses a variety of subgenres, including ASL hip-hop or “dip-hop,” a term coined by Deaf rapper Wawa in 2005 (Best 2015–16, 73). A typical dip-hop performance involves a Deaf or hard-of-hearing artist simultaneously performing vocalized and signed rapping over a looped background beat. Although dip-hop began as a grassroots movement in the early 1990s (Best 2015–16, 71), it has received little analytical attention in the scholarly literature on hip-hop. In this paper, the authors combine techniques adapted from analyzing rhythm in non-signed rap music with techniques adapted from analyzing non-rapped signed songs (Maler 2013, 2015) to analyze the rhythmic flow of tracks by dip-hop artists Sean Forbes, Wawa, and Signmark.</p>
    <p>Condit-Schultz (2016) states that “rap is made musical, as opposed to poetic, by its rhythm.” Much of the current analytical literature on rap music reflects this sentiment by describing rhythmic paradigms in non-signed hip-hop (Adams 2009; Condit-Schultz 2016; Ohriner 2016; Komaniecki 2017). Dip-hop presents a unique format, however, as artists rhythmically convey lyrics in two distinct languages simultaneously.</p>
    <p>In this paper, the authors demonstrate that dip-hop artists have developed genre-specific rhythmic paradigms and tropes to convey the periodicity and rhyme that are fundamental to rap music. Specifically, we address the alignment (or lack thereof) of rhythm and meter in signed and vocal rap and the conveyance of a repeated “beat” through rhythmic signing.</p>
