abstract: |
  <p>Reviewing the 1877 premiere of Jules Massenet’s first essay in grand opera,
  <i>Le Roi de Lahore</i>, Henri de Lapommeraye of <i>La France</i> questioned
  whether the spectacle offered was one “<i>trop beau, peut-être . . . trop beau
  dans l’intérêt du compositeur</i>.” The imperative—both contractual and
  customary—for luxury of spectacle upon Paris’ premier stage makes the critic’s
  statement a curious one. Taking de Lapommeraye’s bon mot as a starting point,
  in this paper I map the growing concern among Parisian critics about the
  prevalence of visual effect over compositional affect in the new operas of
  Paris’ jeunes maîtres.</p>
  <p>I trace the development of these critical anxieties by comparing the shared
  spectacular aesthetic of Massenet’s grand operas and Paris’ <i>Expositions
  Universelles</i> between 1877 and 1891. While music’s indispensability to the
  dazzling phantasmagoria of fin-de-siècle Paris is by now well documented, the
  confluence of spectacle between Parisian world fairs and the city’s cultural
  institutions is not. I shall demonstrate that by sharing not only the
  exhibitionary aesthetic of the <i>Expositions</i> but also their audiences,
  Massenet’s grand operas were increasingly critiqued through the lens of the
  fairs themselves: with wonder, amusement, and ultimately fatigue.</p>
  <p>I argue that the ensuing malaise of exhibition fatigue precipitated by the
  <i>Expositions</i> throughout the decade spilled over into attitudes towards
  France’s pedigree musical genre itself. The paradox whereby the official pomp
  and ceremony invested in the national heritage led to its increasingly
  satirized popular treatment proved deleterious not only to the genre and its
  mausoleum, the Palais Garnier, but also to its most glittering exhibits: the
  grand operas of Jules Massenet. I aim ultimately to demonstrate that the
  Opéra’s commodification of internationalist displays of antiquity became
  simulacra for the national crisis of operatic genre.</p>
