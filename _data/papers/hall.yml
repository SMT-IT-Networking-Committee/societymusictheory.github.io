abstract: |
    <p>In this essay, I describe some of the challenges of being “first-gen” before the concept existed, as well as navigating academia as a single parent. My preparation for graduate school in music theory was also unusual, in that I had an undergraduate degree in psychology and was taking undergraduate courses in music theory while in graduate school. I emphasize the importance of mentors in this somewhat precarious environment.</p>
