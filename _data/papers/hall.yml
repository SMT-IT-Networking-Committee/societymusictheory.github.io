  <p>The Auschwitz-Birkenau Archive holds a number of manuscripts of popular
  songs arranged for one of the men’s orchestras. These songs, written with
  great care in black ink on Beethoven Papier Nr. 31, bear highly ironic, but
  also tragically relevant titles: “Letters That Never Arrived,” “Hours That One
  Can Never Forget,” “Sing a Song When You’re Sad.” I examine manuscript parts
  for one of these songs, “Die Schoenste Zeit des Lebens” (The Most Beautiful
  Time of Life) to learn more about the identity of the copyists, and how these
  songs might have functioned in the surreal environment of a concentration
  camp. Originally a 1941 popular song composed by the German film composer
  Franz Grothe with a text by Willi Dehmel, it has been arranged for the
  instrumentation of one of the men’s orchestras: four first violins, five
  second violins, a viola, two clarinets, a trombone, and a tuba. A source in
  the Franz Groethe Archive in Berlin further reveals that the
  Auschwitz-Birkenau parts are derived from a foxtrot adaptation of the song,
  arranged by Friederich Meyer.</p>
  <p>In <i>Music of Another World</i>, Szymon Laks, one of the conductors of the
  men’s orchestra in Birkenau, describes how he resorted to using <i>odeon</i>,
  a music notation “which makes it possible for any group to perform any work
  regardless of the presence or absence of one or even a few musicians.” The
  constantly changing membership of the men’s orchestras, due to illness,
  selections, suicides, murder, releases and transfers to other camps, make it
  challenging to identify the members of the orchestra during any period of its
  existence. The manuscripts of the popular songs, however, are frequently
  signed with prisoner numbers, which can be linked to names and dates of
  imprisonment. Two of the three copyists for “Die Schoenste Zeit des Lebens”
  sign parts with their prisoner number: 5665 (Antoni Gargul, released on
  October 14, 1943) and 5131 (Maksymilian Piłat, transferred to Buchenwald in
  1943.) In the second half of my paper, I look for similar clues in other
  manuscripts at Auschwitz-Birkenau, to establish a chronology, and identify
  other prisoners who created these song arrangements.</p>
