    <p>When listeners experience Igor Stravinsky’s neoclassical works, they
    often report hearing familiar tonal archetypes alongside modernist,
    “Stravinskyian” materials. Henri Prunières, for instance, describes the
    première of <i>Pulcinella</i> (1920) as “Pergolesi’s music, flavored by
    Stravinsky’s tartar sauce,” while a reviewer of the London première of the
    Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments writes, “M. Stravinsky has
    affirmed his undying allegiance to Johann Sebastian Bach […] Yet what a
    travesty of Bach it is” (<i>Our London Music Critic</i> 1929). While the
    implications of these reviews are multifaceted, they share an underlying
    focus on Stravinsky’s alterations of earlier styles, whether as light
    condiment (“tartar sauce”) or more deeply costumed (“travesty”).</p>
    <p>This illuminates an analytical possibility. In this paper, I argue that
    using Robert Gjerdingen’s archetypes for galant schemata (“stock musical
    phrases employed in conventional sequences,” Gjerdingen 2007, 6), can reveal
    how Stravinsky’s neoclassicism might have been conceptualized by historical
    listeners. I also draw on James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy’s notion of
    deformation as dialogic process (Hepokoski and Darcy 2011), applied to
    schemata in order to explore how such phrases can remain recognizable and
    expectation-laden when some essential features of the pattern endure, but
    others are changed or absent. These analytical deformations—whether tartar
    sauce, travesty, or something in between—expand the ways that the concept of
    deformation can be used in analysis and provide a window into how neoclassical
    music (whether by Stravinsky, Ravel, or others) is commonly experienced.</p>
