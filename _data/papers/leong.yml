abstract: |
    <p>I ask three questions about embodiment in musical practice, from the perspectives of an analyst, a performer, and a choreographer. How does visual bias influence musical interpretation? How do a performer’s physical actions form part of a piece of music? How does musical structure invite one to dance? My vignettes—arising from practical perspectives on multi-modal experiences of music—offer queries rather than conclusions.</p>
