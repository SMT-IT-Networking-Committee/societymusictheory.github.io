    <p>Richard Cohn identifies chromatic, major-third root movement as a
    special class of triadic progression. The contrary motion of half steps,
    described by neo-Riemannian labels as PL or LP, produces a perceptual paradox
    that simultaneously destroys any sense of background diatonic collection and
    forces irreconcilable interpretations of consonance and dissonance. Studies by
    Cohn, Richard Taruskin, and Matthew Bribitzer-Stull identify art- and
    film-music examples ranging from <i>Orfeo</i> to <i>Star Wars</i> that connect
    this type of progression with descriptions of uncanny or supernatural
    phenomena. This paper expands the social implications of the technique by
    exploring the association in contemporary pop music. Surveying over 50 songs
    from 1958-2016, the paper identifies six types of uncanny scenarios associated
    with PL and LP progressions: visions, transcending mental barriers,
    supernatural phenomena, psychological conditions, nonsense poetry, and
    descriptions of dystopia. While some songs fit neatly into one category or the
    other, several examples engage more than one category. In many examples the
    harmonic transformations occur at conspicuous moments where a word-for-word
    connection to the lyrics makes the voice-leading paradox particularly
    effective. With each category, this paper inspects one example in detail and
    lists others in a table. The paper also provides hermeneutic readings where
    the association between lyrics and harmony is less obvious. While not every
    PL/LP transformation evokes an uncanny experience, when the transformations
    are used conspicuously between adjacent or framing harmonies, the pervasive
    associations with the uncanny, across sub-genre and generational lines, are
    hard to ignore.</p>
