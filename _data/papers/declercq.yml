abstract: |
  <p>Prior authors have identified cases of stratification or independence in
  rock music between the melody and the chordal accompanimental layer (or
  “harmony”), a scenario sometimes dubbed the “melodic-harmonic divorce” (e.g.,
  Moore 1995, Stephenson 2002, Temperley 2007). In this paper, I show that a
  similar type of stratification or independence often exists between the
  chordal accompanimental layer and the bass, which I refer to as the
  “harmonic-bass divorce.” I classify cases of harmonic-bass divorce according
  to the three categories of melodic-harmonic divorce introduced by Nobile
  (2015): “hierarchy,” where one layer embellishes while another does not;
  “loop,” where one layer repeats a pattern while another layer moves against
  it; and “syntax,” where two layers exhibit different types of motion to a
  structural goal. As the examples I discuss will show, the idea of the
  harmonic-bass divorce intersects with a number of concepts that are not new to
  music theory, such as pedal points and hybrid chords. When taken as a whole,
  however, these examples point to an overarching approach to musical
  organization among rock musicians—specifically, an independence of the three
  primary functional layers of pitch (melody, harmony, and bass)—that is only
  partially accounted for by the notion of the melodic-harmonic divorce or
  traditional analytical methods. The concept of the harmonic-bass divorce,
  therefore, serves as an interpretive device to round out the broader picture
  of pitch organization in rock and is an especially helpful conceptual tool to
  explain chord extension organization, which might otherwise seem fairly
  capricious.</p>
