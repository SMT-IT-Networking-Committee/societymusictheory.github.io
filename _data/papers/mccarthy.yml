abstract: |
  <p>Professional-class progressives have struggled to explain why black, male
  writers and performers of the 1960s employed appalling homophobic, racist
  tropes concerning black male sexuality. The <i>New York Times </i>toed a
  familiar party line in its obituary for the blaxploitation movie star Rudy
  Ray Moore (1927–2008) when it suggested that Moore embodied stereotypes so
  as to “transcend” them. But as Ishmael Reed notes in his scathing
  contribution to a recent volume entitled <i>The Trouble with Post-Blackness
  </i>(Columbia University Press, 2015), many of Moore’s contemporaries have
  been consigned to the dustbin of history. </p>
  <p>Musicologists have an opportunity to intervene here because it was often
  claimed, as for example in Reed’s novels of the late ’60s and early ’70s, that
  black texts operated in musical ways imperceptible to bourgeois interpretative
  frames. Seen in this way, reading these texts for ideal types seems out of
  place. Ugly tropes were imported not as freestanding types, but as elements of
  a musical texture determined by a thick situation. As such, they could not be
  freely reassembled to serve the interests of a subjected people. Instead, the
  texture itself became subject to transitory modulations effected from within.
  </p>
  <p>For example, the comedy LP record <i>That Funky Tramp in a Nite Club
  </i>(1967), features a heroic black man, the Funky Tramp, who goes on
  adventures accompanied by an ostinato adapted from a current hit song. The
  accompaniment lends substance to unseen actions and structures the Tramp’s
  interactions with audience members. Within this mediated space, the Tramp’s
  most triumphant deeds appear as his basest, his basest as his most triumphant,
  a contradictory effect that could be described as the album’s comic principle.
  This principle has since been lost upon middle-class critics of the album,
  some of whom have explicitly asked why it features music in the first place. A
  musical ear for <i>Funky Tramp </i>can be used to imaginatively reconstruct
  the “structure of feeling” that allowed Moore, himself a black, gay man, to
  interpret texts produced within his milieu in a manner that has never been
  represented by any of the professional academic’s proliferating
  disciplines.</p>
