title: "“When Rocks Crumble and Humanity Does Not Cry Out”: Rudolf Wagner-Régeny’s 1959 <i>Prometheus</i> Opera in a Divided Germany"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>In 1959 the most renowned composer of opera in the German Democratic
  Republic, Rudolf Wagner-Régeny, premiered his <i>Prometheus</i> in the West
  German city of Kassel. From its inception, the work was something of a
  political football: its composition had been partially funded by a grant from
  West Germany, but the East German government saw in its premiere an
  opportunity to promote socialist culture beyond the Soviet bloc. Wagner-Régeny
  had other ideas. </p>
  <p>The composer penned the libretto himself, hewing closely to Aeschylus’s
  <i>Prometheus Bound</i> because he was drawn to the poet’s extended
  ruminations on the distinction between authority and the use of force. Through
  a powerful and sensitive text and his own eclectically modernist and—at
  times—ascetic musical idiom, Wagner-Régeny created an opera that defied
  socialist realist prescriptions set out by the East German musical
  establishment. Yet the artistic achievement of <i>Prometheus</i> can only be
  fully understood within the context of the East German government’s
  unwillingness to come to terms with the trauma of the Second World War, as
  well as its political establishment’s efforts to exert authority over the
  lives of its citizens by cultivating a climate of paranoia.</p>
  <p>Through an examination of archival documents including recordings, program
  notes, personal correspondence, and East and West German reviews of the opera,
  I will explore the ways in which Wagner-Régeny transformed his source material
  into both a potent critique of the cycles of despotism playing out on German
  soil over the twentieth century, and the profoundly personal statement of an
  artist seeking redemption for complicity in that despotism. </p>
  <p>In so doing I seek to enrich and complicate a vibrant conversation begun by
  scholars such as Joy Calico and Elaine Kelly regarding the unique set of
  issues surrounding the composition of opera during the first decade of the GDR
  and opera’s special role in establishing the cultural legitimacy of the
  nascent East German state. I also aim to expand our knowledge of compositional
  practices during the first decade of the GDR by recovering and analyzing the
  work of a composer who has been unjustly neglected in Anglophone
  scholarship.</p>
