abstract: |
  <p>The decline of Italian opera in the early twentieth century is a familiar
  narrative, one that cites the advent of cinema and the deaths of Giuseppe
  Verdi and Giacomo Puccini as contributing factors to the “death” of the genre.
  These factors, paired with the rise of fascism in 1922, create a convincing,
  though inaccurate, narrative for early-twentieth-century Italian opera within
  the Italian fascist regime. Rather than dying out or fading into obscurity,
  opera composition and performance thrived during the twenty years of fascism,
  supported by Mussolini and his regime, with Pietro Mascagni (1863–1945)
  executing the role of operatic icon. Given the lively musicological discourse
  on music and Nazi Germany (Potter 2016, Levi 2014, Hirsch 2010, Kater 1997, et
  al), it is unclear why music in fascist Italy is limited to a handful of
  studies (Nicolodi 1984, Sachs 1987, Illiano 2004). To the contrary of recent
  narratives, Mascagni was immersed in composition and performance for decades
  after his runaway success with <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> (1890), which
  positioned him as Italy’s next operatic leader. After returning to Italy from
  a Viennese tour in 1925, Mascagni pledged his loyalties to Mussolini and
  became an active fixture in the <i>Partito Nazionale Fascista</i>. </p>
  <p>In this paper I demonstrate how Mascagni functioned as fascist Italy’s
  operatic patriarch: the public father-figure in a male-dominated musical
  climate. I argue Mascagni, regardless of his success, challenges the ideal of
  masculine normativity exhibited by Mussolini’s virile, anti-bourgeoisie
  <i>uomo nuovo</i>. By examining historical film reels gathered from the
  Istituto Luce Cinecittà historical film archive, I establish how both
  Mascagni’s image and music were used by the fascist regime to promote his role
  as Italian operatic icon. Mascagni gladly complied with the appropriation of
  his image, whether conducting public performances for the masses or promoting
  his final opera, <i>Nerone</i> (1935). These film reels oscillate between
  public and private settings and construct a nuanced presentation of Mascagni
  in his patriarchal role, underscoring the importance of musical culture in
  fascist Italy and the complexities of masculine representation in fascist
  ideology.</p>
