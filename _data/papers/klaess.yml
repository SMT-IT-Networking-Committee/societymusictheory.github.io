abstract: |
  <p>In the mid-1970s, radio industry periodicals heralded the arrival of
  independent research consultancies to the broadcast media landscape. Broadcast
  consultants offered a variety of services, but the crux of their work entailed
  adjusting a station’s sound to maximize ratings and advertising revenue.
  Alternatively welcomed as “sound doctors” and decried as charlatans, broadcast
  consultants became a stable fixture in the radio industry as it entered the
  era of deregulation. As the radio industry embraced scientific rationalism in
  management and programming, consultants sold themselves as crucial
  intermediaries, brokering a compromise between new, sophisticated audience
  research techniques and previous, intuitive strategies for appraising the
  efficacy of musical sound. </p>
  <p>This paper narrates the rise and work of broadcast consultants in order to
  better understand the intersections of music, sound, and commerce in the
  neoliberal economies of the late twentieth century. Drawing on discourse in
  trade periodicals, archival sources, and oral historical interviews, I argue
  that the confluence of specialist expertise embodied by consultants regarding
  music, its presentation, and reception represented a means of rationalizing—of
  controlling and predicting effects in a way that aspired toward scientific
  precision—radio sound. Adding psychological profiles, lifestyle, and
  consumption patterns to traditional demographic categories such as age,
  gender, race, and ethnicity, this rationalization bore directly on the
  construction of subjectivity in the last quarter of the twentieth century. In
  the hands of modern broadcast consultants, music and radio sound became useful
  indices of subjectivity, tethering different facets of listeners’ identities
  to their activity in consumer markets, and impacting popular understandings
  identity outside the world of advertising. As Timothy D. Taylor has observed,
  in 1980s music and sound were deployed to the end of spurring specific
  behavior in the marketplace, but here I contend that these efforts exceeded
  direct advertising. Rather, music became a means of mapping audience
  subjectivity to a broader neoliberal ideological program that saw market
  activity as the generator and goal of identity. I close by positioning this
  account as a genealogy to recent research examining the connections between
  music and subjectivity in our current age of “Big Data.” </p>
