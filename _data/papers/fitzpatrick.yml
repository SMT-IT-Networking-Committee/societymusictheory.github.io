    <p><em>Agon</em> (1957) is a ballet with music by Igor Stravinsky and choreography by George Balanchine. Since <em>Agon</em> is as an interdisciplinary, domain-crossing work, one concern is how to address the aural domain of the music and the visual domain of the dance. We also want to address these domains in a way that forms meaningful connections. This paper suggests one such link between music and dance is the concept of <em>movement</em>. While we can describe movement in any number of ways, I use <em>Laban Movement Analysis</em> (LMA)<em>.</em> For the purposes of linking music and dance, LMA is particularly powerful because its branch of effort addresses not the <em>bodily</em> or <em>spatial</em> patterns of movement, but rather the <em>qualitative</em> ones.</p>
    <p>As a case study, this paper focuses on a single dance from <em>Agon</em>, the Saraband Step. The first section considers the notion of music as movement. The second section introduces LMA, focuses on the four motion factors attributed to effort (weight, time, space, and flow), and explains how we can hear these elements. Finally, the third section invites us to see and hear how these motion factors interact in a dance. Ultimately, this approach can create a rich listening and viewing experience.</p>
