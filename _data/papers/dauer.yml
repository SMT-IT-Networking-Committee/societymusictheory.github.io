abstract: |
    <p>In the tumultuous long sixties, composer Pauline Oliveros believed that
    sound creation and listening could heal human consciousness by improving
    “receptivity.” Oliveros’s belief that her <i>Sonic Meditations</i> could treat
    the ailments of the American psyche rested on the cognitive neuroscience and
    parapsychology of alpha activity (8–12 Hz neural oscillations). To test the
    efficacy of her compositions and other meditation practices, she organized the
    ten-week Meditation Project in 1973 at the University of California, San
    Diego.</p>
    <p>In this paper I explain Oliveros’s “receptivity” goals and the supporting
    use of biofeedback in the Meditation Project. First, I examine how the
    motivations for Oliveros’s aesthetic practices fit into a countercultural
    diagnosis of white Western ills stemming from technocracy. Next, I look at
    biofeedback and alpha activity as a prescription for these ills because of
    their association with meditative states and the ability to inculcate
    “feminine softness.” I then analyze the roles of alpha activity in Oliveros’s
    1973 Meditation Project: as inspiration for compositions, as biofeedback, and
    as a metric of success in Oliveros’s analysis of participants’ brain data. I
    show how even as Oliveros sought to bridge cultural binaries of East and West,
    the roles of alpha activity reveal concomitant racial essentializations and
    hierarchies in the Meditation Project.</p>
    <p>I argue that Oliveros’s interest in alpha activity began earlier and was
    more central than we previously thought. In the process, I uncover how
    inculcating a “receptive mode of consciousness” was bound up in American Cold
    War Orientalism and white identity anxieties.</p>
