  <p>In the fast-growing area of musicological work on transgender sonic
  practices and forms, it is vital to question the contours of transgender as a
  category and as an analytic. To ask, “What does trans <i>sound </i>like?” is
  to reach through ontological, performative, and aesthetic concerns to think
  through trans as an increasingly reified, yet ever-shifting, category in the
  public imagination. This question provokes new inquiries into embodied sound
  and gendered musicality vis-à-vis the ideologies of voice and authenticity
  that circumscribe whom and how we hear. At the historical intersection of the
  so-called Transgender Tipping Point and the Black Lives Matter movement,
  increasingly mainstream calls for US minorities to “find their voices” compel
  us to understand the gendered and racialized structures of those calls,
  particularly the simultaneously hyperaudible and silenced voices of black
  trans subjects. In this paper, I listen to NYC-based multimedia artist and
  rapper Mykki Blanco’s trans vocal performances as they work through and
  against the very discourses that seek to circumscribe black trans emergence.

  <p>Building upon the growing theoretical concept of transvocality, I consider
  how Blanco’s performances of queer and racialized abjection and excess envoice
  the covergences and collisions between transness and blackness under
  neoliberalism. Blanco’s raspy, digitally altered, and ever-shifting rap flow
  evokes three abject figurations: terrorist drag (à la José Esteban Muñoz),
  trans desire, and posthuman trans embodiment. I argue that Blanco’s use of
  vocal technologies intervene in neoliberal ideologies of both black and trans
  authenticity by unsettling the presumed alignments between voice,
  subjectivity, and body. Although having debuted as a femme
  transgender-identified rapper in 2012, Blanco’s recent shift away from trans
  identity helps me to further refine the concept of transvocality and the
  limits of conceptualizing trans performance in relation to both cisgender and
  trans positionalities. Through an understanding of rap vocality as a site for
  the production and maintenance of racialized gender, I hear Blanco’s voice as
  an example of how trans voices can and do work to reconfigure the terms of the
  sonic production of identity and embodiment. </p>
