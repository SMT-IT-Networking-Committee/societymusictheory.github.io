abstract: |
    <p>Using data from ensemble drumming performances recorded by Andrew
    McGraw in Santiago de Cuba, I show how fluid metric complexes emerge from
    the superposition of distinct interweaving patterns. Factors shaping this
    fluidity include not only the characteristic non-simultaneities of African
    diasporic music but also the metric disposition (binary- or
    ternary-leaning) of the individual layers as well as their degree of
    adherence to strict cyclical repetition. In addition to these temporal
    dimensions, we will consider the amplitude contours of the cycled
    patterns, thereby expanding our view of meter as something richer and more
    nuanced than a discrete stacking of on-and-off dots. We will examine
    performances that differ in instrumentation, number of players, and core
    timeline in order to highlight commonalities while keeping check on the
    risks of overgeneralization. The presentation will also touch on pragmatic
    questions of methodology concerning data representation and manipulation
    in the study of rhythm.</p>
