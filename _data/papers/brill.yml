abstract: |
  <p>In the early 1960s, Pier Paolo Pasolini, already one of the leading
  intellectuals of post-war Italy, embarked on a remarkable career as a film
  director that included <i>Accattone</i> (1961) and <i>Il Vangelo secondo
  Matteo</i> (The Gospel According to St. Matthew, 1964). Like other Pasolini
  works, these two films portray gritty underclass worlds, one set in
  contemporary post-war Italy, the other in Biblical times. Since the subject of
  these two film is a marginalized society, the temptation is to view them as
  pointed political and cultural commentaries. Like Fellini’s <i>La Strada</i>,
  Pasolini’s films outwardly adopt a Neo-Realist affectation. But in fact they
  quickly reveal an impressionistic ethos, one which places their characters and
  stories in a timeless world. The characters of both <i>Accattone</i> and
  <i>Vangelo</i> seem isolated from the world at large, and are thus infused with
  a sense of epic myth. Violence and poverty are primal elements, far removed
  from the economic and social “progress” that embodied post-war Italy. </p>
  <p>In both films, Pasolini uses works by J.S. Bach to sublimate and transcend
  the marginalized characters and societal attitudes beyond their gritty outward
  nature. In particular, Pasolini’s use of Bach’s <i>St. Matthew Passion</i>
  invites an interpretation that often contradicts the profane visual and
  narrative elements of the film. Pasolini’s musical aestheticization of violence
  is one of the many influential characteristics of his oeuvre, one which many
  subsequent film auteurs would embrace, including Stanley Kubrick and Martin
  Scorsese. The latter’s <i>Casino</i> (1995) directly pays homage to Pasolini by
  using Bach’s <i>Passion</i> in similar aesthetic and mimetic fashion. But
  Pasolini’s use of music goes beyond aesthetic enhancement. Bach’s
  <i>Passion</i>, as a religious object, transforms his characters
  (straightforwardly in the case of Christ, but counter-intuitively in the case
  of Vittorio/Accattone) into mythological, spiritual figures that become both
  sacrificed and sacrosanct. This paper will explore Pasolini’s use of Bach’s
  music as an aesthetic and transformative device in his films.</p>
