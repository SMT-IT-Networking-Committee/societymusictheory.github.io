title: "Clearing the Bench: Absolute Music and The Player Piano"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>The player piano promises a new kind of absolute music to its listener,
  free from a performer’s personal influence or error, but the achievement of
  absolute music remains elusive even in its mechanical execution. Moreover,
  mechanical music reshapes the definition of absolute music by allowing
  composers to explore music without the pianist-as-mediator influencing the
  musical product. In this paper I will show how the player piano revises
  standard definitions of absolute music—music about music, defined by Ashby
  (2010), Bonds (2014), Dahlhaus (1995), Goehr (1992), and others—by suggesting
  a performance without the present, laboring body and fallible emotive
  interpretation of a human pianist. Rather than seeking clarity, the paper
  sheds light on one problem within the discourse on absolute music: its
  shifting status after the advent of mechanical reproduction. I support my
  discussion with analyses of original works for player piano, each representing
  a different stage of the player piano’s rise, peak, and fall: (1) Stravinsky’s
  <i>Étude pour Pianola </i>(1917), (2) Casella’s <i>Trois Pièces pour Pianola
  </i>(1921) and Hindemith’s <i>Toccata für Mechanisches Klavier</i> (1926), and
  (3) Nancarrow’s <i>Study no. 2 </i>(from between 1948 and 1960). My analyses
  of these pieces show how early twentieth-century composers take advantage of
  (or ignore) the possibilities the piano keyboard affords when not limited by
  the pianist’s ten fingers. Composers exploited the player piano as medium
  because the mechanical performer does not interpret a work—it plays from the
  data on the roll. In so doing, the player piano suggests a mechanically
  perfect musical absolute. </p>
