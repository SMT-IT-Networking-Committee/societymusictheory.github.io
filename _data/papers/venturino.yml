title: "The Style Incantatoire in André Jolivet’s Solo Flute Works"

abstract: |
  <p>André Jolivet (1905–74) contributed significantly to musical modernism,
  proving particularly influential for Messiaen, Boulez, and their
  contemporaries. My tripartite argument provides a music-theoretical analysis
  of his <i>style incantatoire</i>—a combination of arabesque, pivot-notes, and
  limited and unlimited macroharmony; illustrates the method via analysis of his
  solo flute works; and situates his music within the zeitgeist of
  <i>fin-de-siècle </i>Paris. </p>
  <p>Developing arabesque archetypes from Bhogal 2013, I examine Jolivet’s
  marriage of “emboldened” arabesque, a figure foreshadowed in Debussy’s
  post-1912 works, with Varèsian spatialization. While normative arabesque
  maintains a soft dynamic, spiral-like contour, restricted range, and tendency
  toward descent, Jolivet’s arabesque features a loud dynamic, angular contour,
  expansive range, and tendency toward ascent. Secondly, I investigate his
  multilevel pivot-note technique: single pitch repetition and dual note
  opposition dominate small-scale material, and juxtaposed pitches link
  movements or large-scale pitch collections. Lastly, I explain his organization
  of neutral chromatic pitch space via limited and unlimited macroharmony
  (Harrison 2016). Jolivet juxtaposes contrasting pitch collections while
  completing the chromatic aggregate; his combination of local limited
  macroharmony and large-scale unlimited macroharmony provides a
  multidimensional structure, which—despite its surface pitch stasis—controls
  harmonic progression across a movement or entire piece. </p>
  <p>The lack of research on Jolivet’s compositional method allows for the
  dismissal of his works as reflections of primitivism; as a result, his music’s
  symbiotic neutral and poietic significance continues unrecognized. His
  <i>style incantatoire</i>, however, eclipses both stereotypical imitation and
  modernist fracture, instead foreshadowing the “new, modern classicism” of
  Boulez, Carter, and their contemporaries (Whittall 2003, 203). </p>
