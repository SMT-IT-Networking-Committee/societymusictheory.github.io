    <p>It is shown that the Myhill Property of diatonic set theory has a less
    strict version: the Weak Myhill Property (WMP), contrasted with the
    standard definition denoted as the Strong Myhill Property (SMP). This weak
    version applies to a more comprehensive, mathematical group of tonal
    structures, including the three tonal scale systems named by Hungarian
    theorist Lajos BÃ¡rdos as <i>Heptatonia Prima</i> (H1), <i>Heptatonia
    Secunda</i> (H2), and <i>Heptatonia Tertia</i> (H3). All three scale
    systems have a distinct Circle of Modes (each consisting of 84 scales with
    7 distinct modes in all 12 keys). Only the Circle of Modes from our
    traditional diatonic scales (H1) can be constructed by a single chromatic
    alteration to each scale in the circle. This is a consequence of SMP. The
    Circle of Modes for H2 and H3, on the other hand, can only be constructed
    by a net chromatic alteration; a consequence of WMP. Even though it is
    impossible to transpose any scale within H2 or H3 by altering a single
    pitch chromatically, as their key structures are more complex than H1, it
    is possible to transpose these scales systematically through all four
    heptatonic scales (H0, H1, H2, and H3) if taken together. By raising only
    one pitch at a time by a half-step, these scales form a new mathematical
    group, the Heptatonic Circle, resulting directly from WMP. From these
    constructions, we conclude that WMP warrants further investigation by
    music theorists and deserves a rigorous treatment in mathematical music
    theory.</p>
