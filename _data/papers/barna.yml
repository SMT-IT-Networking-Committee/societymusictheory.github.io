  <p>Recently, digital journalists have published many articles that attempt to
  analyze musical works for a general audience. Many of these blog posts and
  essays claim to utilize music-theoretic concepts as the means to elucidate and
  convey material. The rise of short-form digital journalism allows stories by
  staff writers and freelancers to be written and published rapidly. These
  pieces, often called “quick hits” or “hot takes,” may be well-meaning, but
  their underlying goal is to generate engagement for their publications in the
  form of clicks and comments from as many readers as possible. This pressure
  leads to click-bait headlines and catchy turns of phrase that barely do
  justice to the act of analysis.</p>
  <p>The issues pertaining to mainstream journalism and music theory are
  multifaceted: (1) The authors of the material are non-experts in the field of
  music theory, and their work does not demonstrate engagement with scholarship;
  (2) Qualified scholars in the field have not yet effectively communicated with
  mainstream audiences; (3) The problematic process of data visualization: what
  are effective strategies for communicating with the public when they cannot
  read notated music? These topics are addressed by offering concrete solutions
  to theorists who are interested in taking on the task of public music theory
  within short-form digital journalism. These suggestions are based on
  interviews with editors and journalists from prospective publishers that
  reveal the goals of such articles and information about the readerships.
  Further, I will share my experience—for better or worse—pitching to editors at
  mainstream publications.</p>
