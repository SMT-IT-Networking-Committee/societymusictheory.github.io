  <p>It is notoriously difficult to trace the manufacturing pathways of sound
  technologies from speakers to electronic instruments. The cultural cachet of
  <i>made in</i> labels on audio equipment occludes the gendered and racialized
  reality of subcontracting in the electronics industry, which overwhelmingly
  employs women of color on its factory floors. This is a paper about the
  economic and human conditions that make electronic music possible. Drawing on
  corporate and public records, popular music and technology publications,
  legislation, and activist archives, I survey the labor histories of several
  American manufacturers of audio equipment (Peavey, RCA, Polk, and others), and
  place them in dialogue with users’ valuation of equipment made in different
  places. </p>
  <p>In the late twentieth century, the electronics assembly industry employed
  increasingly vulnerable populations of women. The companies in my focus went
  from employing women in the United States, to rural migrant women in Mexico,
  to rural migrant women in Southeast Asia. Although Donna Haraway has long
  reminded us that “some must labor invisibly for others [to be freed] through
  technology use,” feminist scholarship on music and sound still largely
  revolves around “exceptional” women musicians. Published histories about the
  music industry likewise scarcely mention women’s labor, and where they do,
  they typically gloss it with the same gendered and racialized stereotypes
  advertised by offshore plants: women’s supposed patience, respect for
  authority, ability to focus on the small scale, hands suited for delicate
  work, etc. Happily, a growing body of work in media studies exemplified by
  Lisa Nakamura’s research on Navajo women circuit-builders and the recent
  <i>Routledge Companion to Labor and Media Studies</i> recognizes digital
  culture as reliant on systems of labor centrally indebted to (and exploitative
  of) women. Building on this work, I recast the histories of manufacturing and
  consuming American audio equipment with women’s labor at the center, and
  question its gendered relationship to audiophile cultures.</p>
