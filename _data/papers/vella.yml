  <p>Few operatic works have been as firmly associated with the locations of
  their premieres as Verdi’s <i>Aida</i>, first performed in Cairo in December
  1871. Yet in its time, this fixed link in fact competed with a host of other
  connections, both geographical and chronological: with the Paris Opéra,
  invoked as “true” destination of Verdi’s opera; the Franco-Prussian War,
  misjudged as the historical context for its premiere; or with a constellation
  of mistaken dates and places celebrated as cornerstones in its early
  performance history. Far from merely reflecting the opera’s complex genesis or
  its interactions with a variety of nationalist views and imperial geographies,
  taken together, such misplacings invite an examination of <i>Aida</i>’s
  temporal politics around 1871–72 in the light of technological developments
  and media landscapes that complicated the opera’s local rooting. </p>
  <p>The communication and transport networks that operated in Paris during the
  war of 1870–71 were famously key to the Cairo production. Yet in Verdi’s
  opinion (shared with his publisher Ricordi), Milan was from the start
  <i>Aida</i>’s intended launch pad. Hence the opera’s closely consecutive—and
  contractually interdependent—“two world premieres,” the second at La Scala
  only six weeks after that at Cairo. Milanese critics trumpeted this first
  major operatic event in United Italy as having an unprecedented cosmopolitan
  status. Meanwhile, questions of timing (via telegrams and delayed postal
  correspondences) played critically into how <i>Aida</i> came to occupy a
  “blurred” geo-temporal space.</p>
  <p>Focusing on the Cairo-Paris-Milan triangle, in this paper I examine the
  techno-media apparatus and the attending discourses of immediacy that
  contributed to positioning Verdi’s opera within this liminal cultural realm. I
  argue that, for one thing, such a perspective inflects traditional scholarly
  concerns, rooted in discussions of Orientalism and in postcolonial theory,
  with <i>Aida</i>’s representation strategies. Furthermore, I suggest that
  relocating Verdi’s opera within its early multi-local and technological
  context raises interesting questions concerning its participation, not least
  through its entanglements with emerging concepts of simultaneity, in broader
  spatiotemporal experiences.</p>
