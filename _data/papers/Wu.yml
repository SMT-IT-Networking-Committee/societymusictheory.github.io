    <p>This proposal contributes to the field of post-tonal rhythm studies by demonstrating the rhythmic structure in a chamber work by the Chinese composer Guoping Jia (b. 1963)—<em>The Wind Sound in the Sky</em> (for cello, percussion, and a Chinese wind instrument sheng; 2002). I show how Jia organizes his rhythmic structure based on strings of integers—which indicate durations—derived from the poem <em>September</em> (1986) written by the Chinese poet Haizi.</p>
    <p><em>The Wind Sound</em> contains seven short movements. My presentation focuses on Mvt. I, which contains two parts. The duration of a rhythmic segment in each instrument is generated by one of the two numerical parameters derived from Haizi’s poem: 1) the number of strokes to write each Chinese character, forming string 1 &lt;14, 11, 10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 14, 10, 7&gt;; and 2) the number of characters in each line, forming string 2 &lt;14, 11, 10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 14, 10, 7&gt;.</p>
    <p>Counting one eighth as a beat, the durations of the rhythmic segments in the sheng are represented by string 1. String 2 characterizes the segments in the cello (sixteenth = 1 beat) and percussion (eighth = 1 beat). While segments in the outer voices perfectly align with the two-part formal division, those in the middle smoothly flow through the division, blurring the formal boundary. During my presentation, I will lead the audiences to listen to the music, experiencing the two-part form narrated by the three intricate layers of different durations of the rhythmic segments. </p>
