      bio: |
        <p>Yi-Cheng Daniel Wu completed his Ph.D. (2012) in Music Theory at the University at Buffalo. His research interests focus on the topics of musical form, harmony, voice leading, and pitch contour in 20th- and 21st-century music. He taught at Wesleyan University (Middletown CT, USA), where he served as the Visiting Assistant Professor of Music. He is currently the Associate Professor of Music Theory at Soochow University School of Music (Suzhou, China). His articles appear in Indiana Theory Review, Music Analysis, Musicology Australia, Music Theory Spectrum, Intersections: Canadian Journal of Music, Studia Musicologia, Explorations in Music: Journal of Sichuan Conservatory of Music, Perspectives of New Music (Forthcoming), and The Society for Music Theory Videocast Journal (forthcoming). Aside from music theory, he is also interested in piano performance. In the Spring of 2009, he received first prize in the 2008-2009 UBSO Concerto Competition, in which he performed the first movement from Saint-Saëns’s Second Piano Concerto.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>This proposal contributes to the field of post-tonal rhythm studies by demonstrating the rhythmic structure in a chamber work by the Chinese composer Guoping Jia (b. 1963)—<em>The Wind Sound in the Sky</em> (for cello, percussion, and a Chinese wind instrument sheng; 2002). I show how Jia organizes his rhythmic structure based on strings of integers—which indicate durations—derived from the poem <em>September</em> (1986) written by the Chinese poet Haizi.</p>
    <p><em>The Wind Sound</em> contains seven short movements. My presentation focuses on Mvt. I, which contains two parts. The duration of a rhythmic segment in each instrument is generated by one of the two numerical parameters derived from Haizi’s poem: 1) the number of strokes to write each Chinese character, forming string 1 &lt;14, 11, 10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 14, 10, 7&gt;; and 2) the number of characters in each line, forming string 2 &lt;14, 11, 10, 11, 10, 10, 14, 14, 10, 7&gt;.</p>
    <p>Counting one eighth as a beat, the durations of the rhythmic segments in the sheng are represented by string 1. String 2 characterizes the segments in the cello (sixteenth = 1 beat) and percussion (eighth = 1 beat). While segments in the outer voices perfectly align with the two-part formal division, those in the middle smoothly flow through the division, blurring the formal boundary. During my presentation, I will lead the audiences to listen to the music, experiencing the two-part form narrated by the three intricate layers of different durations of the rhythmic segments. </p>
