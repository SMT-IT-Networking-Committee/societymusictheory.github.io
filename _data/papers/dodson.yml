        <p>Alan Dodson is Assistant Professor of Music Theory at Mount Allison University. Previously he taught at the University of British Columbia, where he was a founding member of the UBC Rhythm Research Cluster. His research interests include the analysis of recorded music, theories of rhythm and temporality, and the studio teaching of Heinrich Schenker. His articles on rhythm and timing in recorded music have appeared in <em>Music Analysis</em>, the <em>Journal of Music Theory</em>, and <em>Music Theory Online</em>, among other journals. He recently completed a chapter on visual representations of expressive timing for the <em>Cambridge Companion to Rhythm</em> and is now working on an annotated translation of Schenker’s lesson books from the 1920s for <em>Schenker Documents Online</em>. He serves on the advisory panel for <em>Oxford Music Online</em> and on the editorial boards of <em>Music Theory Spectrum, Intégral</em>, and<em> Intersections: Canadian Journal of Music</em>.</p>

abstract: |
    <p><em>Nodal points (Knotenpunkte)</em> are mentioned in three of Schenker’s analytical writings from 1921 to 1923, all on works by Beethoven: the monograph on op. 101 and the articles in <em>Der Tonwille</em> on op. 2/1 and the Fifth Symphony. In these texts, nodal points play an important but rather mysterious role. The concept is purported to clarify certain refractory prolongational boundaries and, in one case, equated with “the higher requirement of tonality,” but it is used in several different ways and never clearly defined. I explore this enigmatic and short-lived Schenkerian concept by examining passages from the three Beethoven analyses alongside theoretical accounts of nodal points from <em>Kontrapunkt</em> 2 (1922) and “Freier Satz” (1918–20), an early version of <em>Der freie Satz</em> preserved in the Oster Collection.</p>
    <p>In <em>Kontrapunkt</em>, Schenker mentions nodal points in conjunction with the dissonant passing tone and its relationship to the surrounding consonant intervals. He explains that passing motion gives rise to both end-beginning overlaps and the mental retention of the <em>Stufe</em>, thus to both additive and hierarchical means of generating content, both of which are reflected in the Beethoven graphs. Schenker discusses the hierarchical aspect further in “Freier Satz,” where he claims the melody’s “striding from space to space within a certain chord” guarantees the unity of both the melody and the <em>Stufe</em>―a metaphor he would revisit in “Elucidations” (1924) and later writings, now in relation to the global tonic.</p>
