abstract: |
  <p>In 1819 in New York, the poet Lorenzo Da Ponte published a
  self-aggrandizing pamphlet, titled <i>An Extract from the Life of Lorenzo Da
  Ponte</i>, when a review of Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i> in the Edinburgh
  publication <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> neglected to identify him as the
  opera’s librettist. Da Ponte was righteously indignant and decided to respond
  in print, recording his role in the creation and success of <i>Don
  Giovanni</i> and <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i>. Interestingly, Da Ponte did not
  blame the magazine itself, or opera company advertising. Instead, he blamed
  the subpar translation of his Italian verse into non-singable English
  translations, which Da Ponte saw as a malicious act that had directly caused
  the depreciation of his operas’ libretti among English-speaking audiences.</p> 
  <p>Da Ponte, who had himself translated several operas from French into
  singable Italian versions, was well acquainted with what it meant to translate
  an opera from one language into another. Although he preferred to write
  original works rather than translations, Da Ponte valued the specialized
  skill-set needed to translate operas well. In the 1819 pamphlet, he complained
  that “at one time from ignorance, another from avarice, and not very seldom
  from malice, the words of a comic drama are so badly translated, and the
  translation gives such a low idea of the original, that the poet of the opera
  house and idiot were at a certain time synonymous among the learned of
  London,” asserting that if opera were translated more sensitively “an English
  audience would hear it with more pleasure.”</p>
  <p>Da Ponte’s promotion of his own original poetry, and the fact that many of
  his original opera libretti remain in the modern operatic repertoire have
  obscured his importance as a translator and thinker about translation. In this
  paper, I summarize Da Ponte’s ideas about translation, shedding light on how
  the economics of opera production, the fast circulation of texts throughout
  cosmopolitan Europe, and late-eighteenth-century ideas about authorship and
  ownership, adaptation, and originality all played a role in translation
  practices at the time.</p>
