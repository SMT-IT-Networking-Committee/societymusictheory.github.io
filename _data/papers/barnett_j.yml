title: "Octatonic Serialism in Ginastera’s Piano and Violin Concertos"

abstract: |
  <p>A celebrated if often analytically underrepresented composer, Argentine
  composer Alberto Ginastera garnered international acclaim in the late 1950s at
  a time that coincided with his transition to twelve-tone serialism. Two major
  works from this period, the Piano Concerto no. 1 (1961) and Violin Concerto
  (1963), showcase the esoteric nature of his twelve-tone language, which
  resonates motivically and structurally with the compositional design of his
  earlier, non-serial works. </p>
  <p>The objective of this paper is twofold: first, it illustrates
  characteristics of Ginastera’s compositional language that remained consistent
  as he shifted to twelve-tone composition; and second, it demonstrates how
  these characteristics were repurposed to form the basis of twelve-tone
  organizational strategies in the variation sets of the Piano and Violin
  Concertos. More specifically, this paper illustrates how (0167) and (0369)
  frequently form surface-level motives that are also composed-out over larger
  spans of music, where they emerge as part of the music’s structural
  middleground. Echoing Ginastera’s pre-serial works, these motives often appear
  as parts of sequential patterns that complete one of two octachordal
  collections, which correspond, respectively, to the abstract complements of
  (0369) and (0167): the familiar octatonic collection and what this paper calls
  the “8-note” collection, comprised of tritone-related chromatic tetrachords.
  In the context of the concertos, these octachordal collections interact with
  transpositions of themselves to complete the aggregate on different structural
  levels and in ways that articulate the variation form. </p>
