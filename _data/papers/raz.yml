abstract: |
  <p>In thirteen books published between 1828 and 1856, Scottish color theorist
  David Ramsay Hay (1798–1866) attempted to develop a philosophical account of
  visual beauty based on various aspects of music theory. His writings, which
  frequently invoke Pythagorean tenets, mapped assorted colors, shapes, and
  angles onto harmonic proportions while also exploring extended analogies to
  scale-degree qualia and harmonic function. In spite of the unabashedly
  speculative nature of his project, Hay’s claim that pleasing
  proportions—whether experienced by ear or by eye—reflected preordained laws of
  human and cosmic organization had a profound impact on nineteenth-century
  British notions of aesthetics.</p>
  <p>This paper seeks to understand how Hay’s purported Pythagoreanism stands in
  dialogue with the psychology of his time, which likewise sought to discover
  shared principles of visual and auditory perception. Examining his deployment
  of modern concepts including just intonation, the triad, and scale degree
  function, I demonstrate that his attempt to theorize the formal principles of
  visual beauty was profoundly influenced by the contemporary discipline of
  music theory as practiced in his own day. Hay’s aesthetic writings thus point
  to the crucial role of speculative music theory in the transition from early
  Romantic idealist notions of music as providing access to the infinite, toward
  a valorization of its more abstract, structural qualities as a model for
  aesthetic formalism à la Hanslick and Pater. They also suggest that music
  theory may have played a role in emerging understandings of how experimental
  psychology could explain cross-modal aesthetic experiences.</p>
