    <p>A major development of earlier proto-cognitivist approaches to music, the “Essay on Rythmical Measures” (1790) by the Scottish cleric and musician Walter Young (1744–1814) anticipates several key tenets underlying psychological and music-theoretical understandings of rhythm of our own day. His goal in the Essay is to reveal exactly how our “rhythmical constitution”—the mental capacities and operations of the kind that are today studied in the field of music cognition—determines the rhythmic properties of works of music and poetry and contributes to our appreciation of them. Although the bulk of the work deals with the perception of musical rhythm, it also provides an account of poetic rhythm, and tries to reconcile reports of ancient Greek music and poetry with the shared cognitive principles which, in Young’s view, hold across all times and places.</p>
    <p>The Essay<em>,</em> I argue, represents an early attempt to link universal principles of cognition to the form and reception of cultural productions. As is particularly evident in his conjectural history of ancient Greek musical rhythm, Young’s fervent commitment to the establishment of universal features of perception rendered him blind to his own biases and assumptions, which were firmly anchored in the music of his day. He thus represents a particular kind of response to the larger problem of universalism and relativism, one that continues to resonate with debates in psychology and music cognition today.</p>
