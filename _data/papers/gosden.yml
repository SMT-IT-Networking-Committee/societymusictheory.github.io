abstract: |
    <p>The concept of rotational form that James Hepokoski, Warren Darcy, and
    others have developed over the past 25 years is among the central
    principles of the “new Formenlehre.” One of the most important dimensions
    of rotational form is how the cyclical recurrence of an ordered series of
    thematic ideas may intersect with other approaches to formal organization.
    This includes the deployment of not just highly-conventionalized models
    such as sonata form, but also much simpler patterns that allow for a more
    contextual use of the rotational principle. In this paper, I discuss three
    of Rachmaninoff’s op. 33 <i>Études-tableaux</i> that are clear examples of
    such contextually-determined rotational structures: no. 5 (D minor), no. 8
    (G minor), and no. 9 (C-sharp minor).</p>
    <p>As many scholars have observed, Rachmaninoff’s later compositions
    (especially from 1910 onward) reflect an increasingly complex and
    individualized approach to musical form. Thus, while his earlier
    collections of piano works such as the <i>Moments musicaux</i>, op. 16, and
    the Preludes, op. 23, feature relatively straightforward and clear-cut
    formal designs, his later collections pose much greater challenges when it
    comes to identifying the formal logic underlying each work. As I plan to
    show for the three works under consideration, focusing on the rotational
    organization of motivic-thematic ideas offers a valuable starting point
    from which to understand how each one manifests a simple and familiar
    formal pattern: strophic form (AAA) in the case of 33/5, ternary form (ABA)
    in the case of 33/8, and bar form (AAB) in the case of 33/9.</p>
