title: "„Hit Songs are Spreading like the Plague“: The Berlin Sound Movie Operetta as Media-Critical <i>mise-en-abîme</i>"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>At the Berlin premiere of the sound movie operetta <i>Ich bei Tag und Du
  bei Nacht</i> (I By Night, You By Day, 1932), German film director Ludwig
  Berger confronted his audience with a parody of local Berlin “Kintopp”
  (cinema), a frivolous mélange of operetta clichés and screwball comedy. The
  featured hit songs confirm the mis-en-abîme typical of Weimar films: when
  manicurist Grete spends hours reminiscing about her “Sundays in the cinema”
  while listening to the latest Schlager on her gramophone the musical feature
  film satirized not only its mediatized nature, but also its target audience.
  Ironically, it still became the blockbuster of the season. </p>
  <p>The sound movie operetta’s ambiguous nature of both challenging and
  reaffirming mechanisms of commodifying and mediatizing music lie at the heart
  of the normative discourse emerging from it. Contemporary German film critics,
  such as Rudolf Arnheim and Siegfried Kracauer, pushed a media narrative that
  exclusively emphasized the “escapist nature” of the genre alongside its
  purported aesthetic inferiority. Superfluous musical knickknacks such as the
  Berlin sound movie operetta appear to be a case in point: their unique fusion
  of musical timeliness, new technology, corporate entrepreneurship, and brash
  marketing campaigns seemingly launched a purchasable art of distraction and
  escapism. </p>
  <p>Despite their widely assumed industrialized uniformity, I argue that the
  late manifestation of the genre should be understood as an exercise of musical
  and media-specific self-reflection: sound movie operettas not only
  self-ironically interrogated their aesthetic value and standing, but also
  satirically depicted media of audiovisual reproduction. By giving examples of
  self-conscious exercises of reflection, I show how music and contemporary
  media devices are on conspicuous display throughout the feature films, not
  only for marketing purposes, but to disclose the structural scope and
  manipulative powers of a nascent mass culture. I will closely examine the
  normative media discourse as fanned out in <i>Ich bei Tag und Du bei
  Nacht</i>, <i>Einbrecher</i> (Burglars, 1930) and <i>Das Lied einer Nacht</i>
  (The Song of One Night, 1932). </p>
