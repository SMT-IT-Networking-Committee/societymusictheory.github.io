    <p>Alexandrea Jonker is a doctoral candidate in Music Theory at McGill University. She received a MM from Michigan State University and a B.Mus from Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada. Alexandrea has presented research at the Society for Music Theory annual meeting, and several regional and graduate student conferences. Her two main research interests are the music of Vivian Fine and Johanna Beyer, as well as aural skills pedagogy. Her work has been published in the <em>Routledge Companion to Music Theory Pedagogy</em>, and her paper on “blind ear training” was recognized with the Student Paper Award from the RMSMT regional conference and the Dorothy Payne Student Paper Award from the MTSMA regional conference in 2021. Alexandrea is a two-time winner of the Innovative Learning and Teaching in Music award at McGill University and currently holds a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</p>

    <p>Straus (2011) characterizes “blind hearing” as the methods that blind musicians use to learn and listen to music and participate in music making. While nominally aural skills classes concentrate on a student’s ability to listen musically and “think in music,” in reality these classes rely heavily on visual components such as writing dictations, sight-singing, and working through interval drills. Quaglia (2015), Johnson (2016), Pacun (2009), and<br />
    Saslaw (2009) explore ways in which blind students can be taught in the core music major curriculum. These studies, however, focus on written theory classes and often necessitate the use of braille notation or segregated learning. In contrast, this paper takes Straus’s “blind hearing” as a starting point and argues that by teaching aural skills entirely without the mediation of visual components, instructors can not only accommodate any blind students in their classes but improve the aural abilities of all students. First, I present ten learning objectives based on blind learning preferences, such as reliance on rote and embodied modes of learning. Then, following the precepts of Universal Design for Learning, the second section of the paper proposes a set of “blind” activities students can do in order to achieve these learning objectives, including melody sing-back, singing triads and intervals, and improvisation, among others. By shifting our learning objectives and activities from ones based on notation to those completed aurally, we can accommodate and improve the learning of all students in our classrooms. </p>
