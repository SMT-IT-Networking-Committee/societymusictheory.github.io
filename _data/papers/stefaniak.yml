abstract: |
  <p>Studies of Clara Schumann’s performances have stressed how she applied her
  playing style to other composers’ texts (de Vries 1996, Reich 2001, Klassen
  2009, Stefaniak 2016). But when Schumann performed other composers’ works, she
  often asserted her own compositional voice, too. She employed
  nineteenth-century practices that have attracted little scholarly attention,
  including altering works’ textures and writing cadenzas for “Classical”
  concertos. I consider three concertos Schumann programmed after mid-century.
  Schumann, I argue, customized them to stage hallmarks of her style and
  aesthetic that contributed to her image as an interpreter who abnegated her
  individual subjectivity and revealed works’ inherent essences.</p>
  <p>Schumann’s customizations highlighted her trademark pianistic restraint. In
  her score of Brahms’s Concerto no. 1 (a heretofore unexplored source), Schumann
  handwrote changes to textures. She gave Brahms’s solo new sonic and gestural
  restraint, gradual pacing, and nuanced inflection—qualities that Schumann
  cultivated in her playing overall and that critics regarded as evidence of her
  interpretive aesthetic. Comparing Schumann’s cadenzas for Beethoven’s third and
  fourth concertos with those by other renowned Beethoven interpreters shows that
  she rejected a widespread tradition of introducing massive textures and extreme
  contrasts. Instead, she foregrounded transparent textures and seamless,
  understated transitions. </p>
  <p>In her cadenzas for Concerto no. 4, moreover, Schumann mirrored Beethoven’s
  structural gambits more conspicuously than her contemporaries did in theirs,
  showcasing her supposed ability to reveal Beethoven’s minute but defining
  details. Schumann tempered her first-movement cadenza’s improvisatory rhetoric
  by shadowing Beethoven’s thematic rotations. In her third-movement cadenza, she
  intervened more radically, incorporating themes from other movements. But
  Schumann closed by transplanting a striking climax from the first movement.
  Beethoven unconventionally crowned first-movement cadential trills with a
  lyrical solo theme; Schumann’s summary of the entire concerto fed into this
  soft-spoken culmination.</p>
  <p>Analyzing these customizations contributes to scholarship about how
  nineteenth-century performers exercised creative agency (including Hamilton
  2008, Poriss 2009). Schumann illuminates a largely unexplored, seemingly
  self-contradictory practice: within venerated canonic works (or works by
  canonic hopefuls), performers compositionally crafted scripts that at once
  conveyed their individual performing personae and asserted their legitimacy
  within concert regimes founded upon an ideology of reverent interpretation.</p>
