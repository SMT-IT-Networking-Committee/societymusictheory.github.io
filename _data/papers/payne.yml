  <p>In 1961, President Kennedy announced his Alliance for Progress, a
  multifaceted approach to improving cooperation throughout the Americas.
  Indeed, fostering hemispheric solidarity as a bulwark against communism had
  been at forefront of US goals since 1948. This revival of cordial
  inter-American relations included cultural efforts, as music had proved an
  important anti-Communist tool during previous decades. Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy
  served as the Honorary Chair for second Inter-American Music Festival (IAMF),
  held in Washington, D.C. in 1961. These festivals sought to “bring hearts and
  minds into closer accord,” and the programming favored difficult, avant-garde
  compositions; compositions that catered to international intellectualism
  rather than displays of overt nationalism. The President and Mrs. Kennedy
  offered their support to the third festival, which aimed to eclipse the
  previous ones. Arthur Schlesinger touted the festivals as a symbol of a
  culture-conscious administration that supported artistic achievement on a
  hemispheric scale. Likewise, the State Department’s Chief of Protocol, Angier
  Biddle Duke, called the festivals a “vital element” to the success of the
  Alliance for Progress. By 1962, the festival’s executive committee had
  commissioned twenty-four new works, mostly from Latin American composers. Yet
  the State Department ultimately canceled the 1963 festival. Its indefinite
  postponement sparked a minor uproar, notably in the US House of
  Representatives, which introduced a joint resolution to strengthen hemispheric
  cultural exchange. The resolution cited the National Cultural Council of
  Cuba’s various projects, calling them a Soviet-funded cultural offensive to
  influence Latin America’s elite. I argue that the festival’s cancellation
  revealed anxieties about US’s own cultural offensives, especially with regards
  to Inter-American amity. The festivals as a whole additionally reveal the US’s
  contradictory attitude toward Latin American relations. Situating these
  festivals within a Cold War context illuminates how rhetoric concerning
  “mutual understanding” through musical celebration co-existed with covert
  plans of military intervention. </p>
