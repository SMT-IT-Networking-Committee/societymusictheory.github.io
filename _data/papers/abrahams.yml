title: "But We’re not in Zombie Mode: Meter and Selected Attention in Greek Orthodox Movement and Music"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>“I don’t place myself in zombie mode,” said Greek Orthodox priest Father
  “Theodoros,” discussing how he simultaneously pays attention and <i>does not
  </i>pay attention to the music around him when conducting a service
  (Interview, February 2017). He was trying to explain the specific mental,
  spiritual, and fully embodied state he enters when leading the Liturgy. In
  this paper, I explore the metrical interactions between musical structure and
  body movements arising when Greek Orthodox clergy are conducting a service in
  this mode (which is <i>not </i>“zombie mode”). </p>
  <p>Greek Orthodox worship includes chanted, unaccompanied music that may be
  understood as <i>semi-metered</i>: music that allows for varying levels of
  attention and entrainment to meter on the part of the listener and/or
  performer. When such semi-metered chanting is considered alongside the
  prescribed ritual movements of the priest, an asynchronous relationship is
  unveiled between body and voice. As existing studies on trance and ecstatic
  rituals present metricity and synchronization as powerful ways of directing
  attention towards spiritual experience (e.g., Becker 2004; Csordas 1997;
  Goodman 1988), one might expect Greek Orthodox worship to be dis-entraining.
  However, these moments of asynchrony and complex metricity prove to be
  comprehensible using procedural memory and selective attention, as my
  interviews with Chicago-area priests demonstrate. In combining ethnography and
  embodied music analysis, I am afforded a deeper understanding of embodied
  musical moments that are non-ecstatic, asynchronous, and semi-metered. </p>
