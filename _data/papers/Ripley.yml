    <p>In the wake of the SMT 2019 plenary session “Reframing Music Theory,” diversity has garnered increasing attention in the field as music theorists consider issues of composer and theorist identity and interrogate biases implicit in traditional methods of analysis. Advocates for greater diversity in theory pedagogy recognize the potential benefits for future generations of musicians while acknowledging the challenge of finding appropriate pieces to share with students (Palfy and Gilson 2018, Stroud 2018). In this presentation, I outline a pedagogical approach that emphasizes pieces by diverse composers and promotes deep learning (Alegant 2014, Lang 2016) through recurring engagement with a complete piece, or “touchstone,” to which students apply each concept they learn during a course. For example, Theory II students explore second-inversion triads, motives, cadences, small forms, non-chord tones, diatonic seventh chords, and secondary-function chords in Cécile Chaminade’s “Idylle” (Op. 126, No. 1). I discuss criteria for effective touchstone pieces, suggest nine possible touchstones for Theory I–III, and share analytical highlights of the repertoire I recommend. As reflected by the pieces I suggest—including four by women composers and three by composers of color—touchstones provide opportunities to highlight work by composers from historically underrepresented groups (Hisama 2018, Malawey 2020). Using a touchstone piece by an underrepresented composer reduces the risk of tokenism by elevating the piece to a prominent position within the course. Students who analyze touchstone pieces deepen their understanding of music analysis by examining course concepts in the authentic context of complete works of music.</p>
