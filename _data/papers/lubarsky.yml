abstract: |
  <p>1957 was an important year for the early music ensemble New York Pro Musica
  (NYPM) and its director Noah Greenberg. That year saw the premiere performance
  of the liturgical drama <i>The Play of Daniel</i> at the Cloisters Museum in
  New York City, which became a signature production that the group revived
  annually, broadcast on television, and took on international tours. Although
  scholars including Kirsten Yri and John Haines have discussed the group’s
  performances of <i>The Play of Daniel</i>, another major event occurred in
  1957 that has received little attention. That year the group signed a major
  record contract to appear on Decca’s Gold Label Series, gaining access to the
  latest sound recording technologies in studio. From then on, NYPM recorded in
  stereo. </p>
  <p>Drawing on recordings, marketing collateral, and printed critical reviews,
  this paper argues that NYPM’s shift to stereo recording offered more than just
  a higher-quality method of music distribution. It altered how the ensemble
  framed the Medieval and Renaissance music it performed as well as its approach
  to performance practice. Responding to growing demand for timbral listening
  that the (supposedly) better sound quality of the new technology created, NYPM
  highlighted the unique timbres of historical instruments, emphasizing their
  use as a historical fact, creating increasingly “kaleidoscopic”
  orchestrations—a term commonly associated with stereophonic sound in the 1950s
  and 1960s—and even re-recording one Renaissance vocal work to include
  instruments. By the middle of the 1960s, critics noticed Greenberg’s
  conspicuous orchestrations and called them excessive and historically
  improbable.</p>
  <p>Looking at NYPM’s output through a history of technology offers new insight
  about well known trends of the twentieth-century early music movement,
  specifically, what Daniel Leech-Wilkinson calls the “instrument-and-voices
  hypothesis” and the Neoclassical call for restraint that Richard Taruskin
  argues was central to “authenticity.” While such intellectual and style
  histories tend to posit aesthetic tastes as social values freely chosen by
  historical actors, this paper illuminates the material contingencies that
  sound recording technology placed on musicians and their music. Not just a
  historical hypothesis or style choice, NYPM’s orchestral abundance flourished
  in a stereophonic environment that fostered renewed interests in timbral
  listening. </p>
