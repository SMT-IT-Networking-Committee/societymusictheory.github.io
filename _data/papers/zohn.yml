abstract: |
  <p>In his 1718 autobiography and subsequent writings, Georg Philipp Telemann
  fashioned himself as a Modern by eschewing what he saw as the contrapuntal
  pedantry and melodic emptiness of the Ancients, as represented by older
  musicians such as his former colleague at the Sorau court, Wolfgang Caspar
  Printz (1641–1717). Yet as Keith Chapin has argued (<i>Music & Letters</i>,
  2011), Telemann in fact took a <i>galant</i> middle path by combining a Modern
  compositional idiom with an Ancient habitus that stressed exercising good
  judgment, selecting appropriate compositional models, and maintaining autonomy
  from tradition. </p>
  <p>In this paper I argue that Telemann’s relationship with the past was yet
  more complicated, as witnessed by vocal works in which he treats the Ancient
  musical style (a mid-seventeenth-century idiom rather than the older and more
  common <i>stile antico</i>) as a topic. This antiquated musical language,
  rapidly fading from living memory, functions as a simulacrum—a distorted,
  exaggerated version of the real thing that is intended to make it sound all the
  more genuine to the listener. Thus the opening movement of <i>Sehet an die
  Exempel der Alten</i>, TVWV 1:1259 (1721), set to a dictum drawn from the
  Wisdom of Sirach, deploys the Ancient style to make a textual-musical pun about
  Old Testament figures. More ingenious is Telemann’s use of Ancient music in the
  dialogue cantata <i>Erhöre mich, wenn ich rufe</i>, TVWV 1:459 (1717), where
  archaic and modern styles are set in opposition to each other in order to
  underscore a theological message. Here the fearful, disconsolate Christian
  sings in a seventeenth-century idiom to the accompaniment of an outmoded
  instrumentarium of cornetto and trombones. Jesus, on the other hand, is a
  Modern who consoles the Christian by singing in an eighteenth-century idiom,
  with up-to-date oboes taking the place of the brass choir. The clashing and
  eventual reconciliation between musical past and present reminds the
  congregation that faith must be maintained continuously, lest one be lost (like
  the Christian) spiritually and temporally. This bold musical experiment also
  serves as a metaphor for Telemann’s self-image as an enlightened Modern
  committed to the Ancient practice of model-based emulation.</p>
