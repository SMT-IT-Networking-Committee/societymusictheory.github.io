Post-Tonal Music"

    <p>The extent to which meter is perceived in rhythmically irregular
    post-tonal music has been a matter of speculation and investigation for
    several decades and is still not entirely agreed upon. Some early
    acknowledgements of the problem (Lester 1986; Lewin 1987), as well as more
    fully developed theories (Lerdhal and Jackendoff 1983; Roeder 1994; Hasty
    1997), privilege perceived periodicity over the notated meter. At the same
    time, strict periodicity has been called into question by theories
    incorporating non-isochronous meters (London 2012), motive-driven
    aperiodic meter (Horlacher 1995), and other irregular metric structures
    (Kramer 1988; Leong 2011).</p>
    <p>I approach the issue from the perspective of local regularity: if
    meter, isochronous or otherwise, is perceived in rhythmically irregular
    post-tonal music, it must arise from an attempt to entrain to regularity
    at the moment-to-moment level. Mirkaâ€™s (2009) parallel multiple-analysis
    processor is especially suited to account for such real-time, predictive
    metric processing. I extend her model to account for (1) standard
    non-isochronous meters, (2) fluctuating sensations of meter in more deeply
    irregular music, (3) meter in multiple perceptual streams, and (4) music
    that systematically subverts metric processing. I situate the discussion
    in passages by Babbitt, Barber, Carter, Feldman, Henze, and Webern, in
    which perceived meter is tied to structural and expressive aspects of
    pitch, form, and text. I also discuss the relationship between my
    theoretical generalizations and work on temporal thresholds (London 2012),
    metrical reinterpretation (Temperley 2008), metrical dissonance (Krebs
    1999), selective attention (Jackendoff 1987), and modular perception
    (Temperley 1995).</p>
