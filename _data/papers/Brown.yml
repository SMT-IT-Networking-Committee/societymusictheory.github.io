    <p>In his work on Lutosławski, Charles Bodman Rae has explored a crucial trait: namely, the composer often focuses on a pair of interval classes, treating them as building blocks of structure. Dubbed “interval pairing” by Bodman Rae, this technique most commonly occurs in the melodic dimension of Lutosławski’s music, but sometimes influences his approach to harmony as well. This presentation aims to carry forward Bodman Rae’s work by harnessing the <em>Tonnetz</em> to investigate interval pairing in Lutosławski’s music. The presentation examines numerous excerpts from Lutosławski’s music of the 1950s through the 1980s, including a detailed look at his <em>Grave</em> for Cello and Piano (1981). </p>
    <p>Of particular interest, Lutosławski’s music typically switches among two or more different pairings of interval classes. This begs the question: does Lutosławski treat his various interval pairings in a similar way? In other words, can we discern any general principle governing his approach to interval pairing? As I will demonstrate, such a principle does in fact underlie most of Lutosławski’s passages involving interval pairing. Specifically, these passages tend to operate within a 2xN region of a <em>Tonnetz</em>—or to put it another way, they tend to inhabit two parallel “tracks” of a <em>Tonnetz</em>. Though Lutosławski’s various choices of interval pairings often result in passages that outwardly sound very different from each other, this principle serves as a common thread uniting them. By exploring this principle in a number of his works, this presentation sheds new light on a fundamental aspect of Lutosławski’s music across the decades.</p>
