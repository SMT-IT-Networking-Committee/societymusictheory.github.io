    <p>Rhythm tap, which developed alongside bebop in the twentieth century, is a style of dancing that is concerned more with the sounds produced by the dancer than with the visual presentation of dance movements. Practitioners, who often consider themselves musicians of jazz percussion (Hill 2010), combine rehearsed patterns with patterns improvised in response to the improvisations of live musicians. Despite this art form’s singular focus on the sonic product and its position within jazz tradition, rhythm tap has received little attention among music scholars until recently. </p>
    <p>In this paper, I offer a close reading of a performance at the 2013 Stockholm Tap Festival by Dormeshia. A woman in a male-dominated art form, Dormeshia’s intersectional identity explains in part why she is recognized as both one of the greatest tap artists of her generation and among the most underappreciated. My analysis explains the high level of musicianship demonstrated in her performance, a level that separates her from many in her field. Like Robbins and Wells (2019), I apply concepts of jazz improvisation from Paul Berliner and from Ingrid Monson. However, I draw especially on the metaphor of conversation in jazz, and I illustrate my analyses using annotated video clips and choreomusical transcriptions. The analysis examines trades between Dormeshia and the bassist, who imitate and challenge each other to greater virtuosity, rhythmic complexity, and inventiveness. In dialogue with the bassist, Dormeshia expresses her identity as a jazz musician, an insider in this way of music making and being in a musical community. </p>
