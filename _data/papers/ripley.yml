    <p>When first encountering post-tonal music, students discover repertoire
    that differs aesthetically from music they have previously studied and
    requires new analytical tools. To help students approach this repertoire
    with open minds, I frame my undergraduate post-tonal theory course as a
    virtual study-abroad experience with “postcard” assignments that
    synthesize analysis and reflection through prose writing. Each postcard
    includes a 300- to 500-word essay (message) and a single page of annotated
    musical examples (picture).</p>
    <p>In their postcards, students analyze complete compositions through the
    lenses of specific themes. For example, students discuss pentatonic
    collections and pitch centricity (Debussy, “La fille aux cheveux de lin”),
    explain how imitation and z-cells provide unity and contrast (Bartók,
    “Chromatic Invention 1”), explore relationships among pitch-class sets
    (Webern, Op. 7, No. 3), and select their own repertoire to illustrate the
    course concepts they find most important. The underlying theoretical
    framework for these assignments comes from Self-Determination Theory,
    which includes intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as well as humans’ basic
    psychological need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p>
    <p>Students respond positively to the postcard assignments, developing
    creative titles as captions and sometimes formatting their assignments to
    look like real postcards. By addressing their postcards to different
    recipients (peer, novice, expert, and future self), students learn to
    communicate effectively in diverse rhetorical contexts. Additional
    pedagogical benefits include greater independence in music analysis and
    increased confidence in writing about music. With insightful analytical
    comments and language tailored to their intended recipients, the postcards
    become souvenirs of learning from students’ exploration of post-tonal
    music.</p>
