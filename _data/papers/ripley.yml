abstract: |
  <p>Mock trials can help music theory students analyze compositions whose
  thematic, formal, or tonal ambiguities invite multiple interpretations. I
  outline the structure of a music theory mock trial, present three sample
  cases, and discuss student responses and pedagogical benefits of using mock
  trials in the music theory classroom.</p>
  <p>Music theory mock trials consist of four phases: investigation, evidence,
  verdict, and discussion. During the investigation phase, students work
  together in small groups to analyze a composition and gather musical evidence
  for the trial. In the evidence phase, students adopt the roles of witness,
  lawyer, court reporter, bailiff, and juror. Students demonstrate high levels
  of engagement as they present evidence supporting their conflicting analyses
  and question each other. Student jurors then deliberate and render a verdict
  in favor of one of the analyses presented during the evidence phase. A
  concluding discussion explores what students have learned and how the mock
  trial may have influenced their analyses.</p>
  <p>Music theory mock trials work well with a wide variety of analytical topics
  and repertoires, as demonstrated by three sample cases. In these cases,
  students investigate motivic material in Bach’s Invention in B-flat Major (BWV
  785), confront cadential ambiguity in Schumann’s “Aus meinen Thränen
  spriessen” (<i>Dichterliebe</i>, no. 2), and join the scholarly debate
  surrounding Wagner’s enigmatic <i>Tristan</i> chord. By analyzing compositions
  via music theory mock trials, students learn to identify and articulate
  musical features to support their analyses, consider diverse music-analytical
  perspectives, and deepen critical-thinking skills while engaging their peers
  in a spirited, but respectful, dialogue.</p>
