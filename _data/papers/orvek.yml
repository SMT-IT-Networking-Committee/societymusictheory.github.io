        <p>David Orvek is a Ph.D. student at Indiana University’s Jacobs School of Music where he also works as an associate instructor for the undergraduate music theory sequence. He holds degrees in music theory from Southern Adventist University and The Ohio State University. His research to date has focused on transformational approaches to voice leading, particularly as it applies to music of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. His presentation today is based on his 2019 master’s thesis entitled, “Generalized Transformational Voice-Leading Systems.” In addition to his interest in transformational theory, David has also done work with computer- assisted music analysis and corpus studies and is an active classical guitarist.</p>

    <p>In this poster, I propose a generalized transformational system for studying voice leading within a single set class. Such a system not only provides ready-made transformational machinery for a variety of repertoires and analytical contexts, but also reveals similarities in the voice-leading possibilities within different set classes. While there exist transformations designed to act on large families of set classes (Straus 2011; Fiore and Satyendra 2005, among others), no studies to date have considered the relationship of these transformations to voice-leading efficiency or integrated them into a larger, generalizable transformational system. As I show in this poster, Richard Cohn’s (1998) “sum-class” system—originally designed for consonant triads—provides a framework for just such a system.</p>
    <p>I begin by reviewing the basics of Cohn’s sum-class system through an analysis of a passage from Schubert’s G-minor violin sonata and then show how this system can be modified to accommodate other set classes. I then use this generalized sum-class system to observe the ways in which voice leading in passages from Schoenberg’s <em>Pierrot lunaire</em> and <em>Das Buch der hängenden Gärten</em> is similar to that seen in the Schubert excerpt. Finally, I conclude with a brief survey of my expanded sum-class system as manifest in other pitch structures. This not only suggests that the possibilities of within-set-class voice leading are quite similar for sets of the same cardinality, but also reveals that sum-class systems for some set classes are strongly related to familiar conceptual structures like the circle of fifths.</p>
