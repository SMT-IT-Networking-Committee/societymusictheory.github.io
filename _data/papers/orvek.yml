    <p>Dame Elizabeth Maconchy (1907–1994) is a hugely neglected figure in twentieth-century British music. A student of Vaughan Williams, Maconchy was lauded in Britain throughout her long and productive career as a unique voice in British music. And yet, her music has received very little scholarly attention even amongst scholars of British music, and she is virtually unknown in North America. My goal in this paper is to introduce other scholars to Maconchy’s music and to begin an analytical investigation of her style. Toward this end, this paper provides an analysis of Maconchy’s String Quartet No. 11, a work which Blunnie (2010) calls “the pinnacle of Maconchy’s late style.” </p>
    <p>Perhaps the most commonly noted characteristic of Maconchy’s music is its economy, integration, and cohesiveness. Maconchy herself notes this about her music and describes her eleventh quartet as “perhaps the most completely integrated of my quartets” (Maconchy 1989). Taking Maconchy’s comments as a point of departure, my analysis explores the ways in which Maconchy achieves this “completely integrated” structure through her use of inter-movement quotation and developing variation of a small set of motives. Though the eleventh quartet is perhaps the most extreme example of this kind of construction, Maconchy’s concern for unity in this quartet and the techniques by which she achieves it are emblematic of much of her output. It is thus my hope that this paper will engender better understanding not only of this particular quartet but also her unique and compelling musical language as a whole.</p>
