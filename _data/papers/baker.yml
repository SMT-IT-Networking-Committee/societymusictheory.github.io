    <p>A common use of tonicization involves altering the overall tonic harmony to momentarily sound like the applied dominant of IV. However, when this occurs directly at the outset of a composition, it immediately casts doubt upon the opening tonic’s role as the decisive signifier of tonality. A similar expressive effect occurs when the V7/IV accompanies the melodic <em>Urlinie</em> closure, motivating a post-cadential prolongation technique common to works featuring this device. In each case, the apparent tonicization of IV is only of passing interest when compared to the destabilizing chromatic alteration of the overall tonic harmony. Whereas numerous composers may have occasionally employed dominantized tonics in this manner, this technique occurs with a marked frequency in the songs of Felix Mendelssohn, a composer considerably less regarded for his songs than for his accomplishments in other, instrumental genres. This poster will examine four particularly important compositional uses in Mendelssohn’s songs: (1) beginning an entire song immediately on the dominantized tonic, (2) setting the first vocal entrance with the dominantized tonic following a piano introduction, (3) ending the vocal melody on the dominantized tonic prior to the final bar of a song, and (4) concluding an entire song on an altered tonic sonority, prepared with a dominantized tonic. Although one may simply regard many of these altered tonic harmonies as V7/IV and stop there, doing so ignores the extravagance of their structural and expressive effect, especially when used at the outset of a work.</p>
