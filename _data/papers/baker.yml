    <p>While The Bad Plus (TBP) is hardly the only jazz piano trio to perform covers of modern popular songs, their approach is more consistently heard as ironic by fans and critics alike. The band has rejected this facile interpretation, asserting that their covers are earnest attempts to “make rock, pop, and electronica songs vehicles for contemporary improvisation” (TBP 2007). Nevertheless, the trio maintains a reputation “for being irony-steeped hipsters who play irreverent pop covers, and who like nothing better than to thumb their noses at the jazz tradition” (Argue 2006).</p>
    <p>In this paper, I argue that these two dimensions of TBP’s covering practices are often interdependent. I build on Janet Bourne’s (2016) framework for analyzing musical irony in order to posit three musical transformations—<em>side-slipping</em>, <em>overextension</em>, and <em>parameter shift—</em>that recur across TBP’s cover catalog and court ironic hearings by flouting various combinations of the so-called Gricean maxims. Using these transformations to frame potential links between musical structure and expression, I explore how the transformations signify a novel approach to a source song as a compositional and improvisational referent—often yielding imaginative or divergent solo spaces—while also underpinning the vertiginous contrasts, knowing misinterpretations, and rhetorical panache for which the trio is famous. By examining how this balance manifests in several of the band’s performances, I suggest that TBP’s cover transformations regularly yield both compelling developmental processes and dynamic improvisational environments, even when—or perhaps, <em>especially</em> when—these transformations are catalyzed by ironic subversion.</p>
