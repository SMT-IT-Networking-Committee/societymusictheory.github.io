abstract: |
  <p>Since the dawn of the jazz tradition, jazz musicians have used popular
  songs as vehicles for improvisation, from the standards of the Great American
  Songbook to music by Radiohead and Michael Jackson. In recent decades, such
  cross-genre borrowing has become commonplace in popular music, producing
  covers ranging from the imaginative to the banal. How has the prominence of
  this cover phenomenon reconfigured the playing of popular music by jazz
  musicians? Has jazzâ€™s standard practice become just another case of genre
  crossing in a polyglot musical culture?</p>
  <p>This paper examines the intertextuality of jazz performances of recent
  popular music. In the context of several analyses, I argue that in the hands
  of capable jazz musicians, popular songs are neither new jazz standards nor
  simply tunes to be covered. Instead, jazz performances of popular music can
  evince a distinct intertextuality that balances fidelity to a specific
  recording with the improvisatory freedom that remains a hallmark of the jazz
  tradition.</p>
