    <p>Henri Dutilleux described his <i>croissance progressive</i>
    (progressive growth) technique as a process in which “thematic elements”
    undergo gradual development such that by the end of the work, they “reach
    their definitive form” (Potter, 1997). But this directional quality is
    questioned by some works whose main element from the beginning also
    appears at the end, suggesting, as Dutilleux stated, “a notion of time as
    circular” (Nichols, 1994). In this paper, I consider two works,
    <i>Ainsi</i> <i>la nuit </i>(1976), and <i>Mystère de l’instant</i>
    (1989), to show a broader conceptualization of the progressive growth
    technique in two ways. First, I expand upon existing analyses by Potter,
    Monpoel and Hesketh to reveal new evidence of Dutilleux’s technique in
    <i>Ainsi</i> … in relation to pitch material by way of tri-chord pair
    analysis rather than the typical unordered hexachord approach to the
    opening chord. Second, I argue connections between movements in both works
    with Boulezian conceptions of smooth and striated time, and, in this
    light, show temporally proportional analyses of Dutilleux’s work that
    reveal goal-oriented formal locations consistently signified by a
    disruption or negation of metered subdivision and coordination. To more
    fully realize these implications, I draw a connection to Deleuzian
    theories on <i>Chronos</i> versus <i>Aiôn</i>, the undivided extended
    present versus a durationless instant separating past and future. In
    conclusion, I argue that the progressive growth technique can be
    understood to operate beyond conventional pitch and rhythm relationships,
    carrying deeper connections on levels of musical time and form.</p>
