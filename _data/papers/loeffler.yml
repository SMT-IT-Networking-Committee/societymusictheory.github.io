abstract: |
  <p>Nineteenth-century English travel literature about the northern Swiss Alps
  established interlinked visual, cultural, and aural expectations for English
  travelers on the Grand Tour. The primary aural expectation of an idyllic
  herding called called the Ranz des Vaches could be sung and/or played on the
  alphorn, but, as the English considered it the final bastion of the power of
  ancient Greek music, it required a morally pure musician who also met the
  aesthetic requirements of the rural exotic that the English expected from the
  mountains themselves. Research on the Ranz des Vaches has not drawn
  extensively from nineteenth-century travel literature; my exploration turns to
  this body of work, including famous travel guides and the journals of
  individuals of various status, to investigate its various manifestations and
  functions.</p>
  <p>Using these sources, my paper suggests that the Ranz des Vaches developed
  in part as a commercialization of the scenery in the Bernese Oberland, a
  region previously defined by isolation and deep poverty. The influx of
  travelers on the Grand Tour represented a potential source of income for the
  rural musicians, who could capitalize on the travelers’ visual and
  philosophical expectations. Busking occurred at a series of specific scenic
  locations in the Bernese Oberland, beginning near Lake Brienz at the turn of
  the nineteenth century, and subsequently spreading into the valleys to the
  south of Interlaken. As busking increased, gender roles became more codified:
  only men or boys would play the Ranz des Vaches on the alphorn, and it was
  only sung by women and children, and thus potentially providing a source of
  income for women. Finally, the travel literature offers a valuable insight
  into the power dynamics between the English travelers and Swiss musicians.
  As long as the music-making was heard as complementary to the scenic
  experience, it was happily received; but as the number of musicians
  increased, they were, ironically, seen as morally degenerative and therefore
  inauthentic distractors from the scenery.</p>
