    <p>In <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> (2020), players socialize, build, and explore an infectiously cartoony island community against a backdrop of equally infectious music. This backdrop consists of continuously looping music that changes every hour, on the hour; producing a daily cycle of twenty-four compositions tagging each hour to a distinctive sonic identity. But though such cycles have long been a series hallmark, in <em>New Horizons</em>, for the first time, each miniature is constructed out of motivic materials from the game’s title track. With this change, <em>Animal Crossing’s</em> signature cyclic soundscape has been centered around a reference point, effectively transforming it into a set of variations on a theme ascribed to the fictional canine composer, K. K. Slider.</p>
    <p>At one level, the variation techniques in <em>New Horizons</em> are deeply familiar: each hourly composition selectively elaborates materials from the title track and brings them into new topical fields. But unlike the variation sets of classical music, these techniques operate within a non-teleological, ludic frame, in which variations are environments to be immersed in rather than aesthetic objects to enjoy attentively. Players are thereby encouraged simultaneously to regard the cycle as an index for the routines and schedules of the virtual world and to build mental links between temporally disparate play spaces that are tagged to similar musical motives. By bringing variation techniques into a temporally distended and non-teleological space of play, <em>New Horizons</em> thus unlocks new ways of understanding the functions of motivic reminiscence, analogical thought, and topical recognition in musical experience.</p>
