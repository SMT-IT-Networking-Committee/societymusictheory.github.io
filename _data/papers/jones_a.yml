abstract: |
  <p>This paper re-examines the early critical reception of Giuseppe Verdi’s
  <i>Rigoletto</i> in relation to contemporary accounts of noise—and
  silence—within Venice’s soundscape. Widespread claims by local critics that the
  opera was “less noisy” than Verdi’s previous works indicate less a change in
  the composer’s approaches to voices or instrumentation than a loosely
  coordinated strategy among Venetian writers and political leaders to meet the
  renewed occupation of the city with silence, boycotts, and other gestures of
  quiet resistance. </p>
  <p>In October 1849, less than two months after the Austrian Empire finally
  quelled Venice’s year-long revolution, the <i>Gazzetta di Venezia</i> published
  several articles tying a recent decrease in noise and suffering in the city to
  an increase in Austrian control. The Austrians were perplexed and annoyed that,
  despite orders otherwise, Venetians were avoiding the elaborate parades and
  masses marking the arrivals of Austrian officials, instead meeting these
  celebrations with silence and darkness. This political protest extended to the
  theaters: the sparsity of audiences nearly forced La Fenice to close in
  1850.</p>
  <p>The sonic siege purportedly ended when <i>Rigoletto</i>’s world premiere
  drew crowds back to La Fenice in March of 1851, although some attendance
  reports conflict. Looking to explain the work’s success, one critic crowed that
  “the reign of the bass drum . . . is as good as done,” his assessment signaling
  a broader embrace of restraint in critical responses to the opera’s sonic
  palette as well as its dramatic atmosphere. <i>Rigoletto</i> is an opera of
  darkness: the second scene of Act I and all of Act III feature night scenes
  where visibility is so reduced only sound acts as guide. When critics praised
  the orchestra’s ability to “speak to you, cry to you,” they placed values of
  expressive immediacy above the artificiality and technological wizardry that
  characterized the spectacles staged by the Austrian occupiers. Reading
  <i>Rigoletto</i>’s reception in connection with everyday Venetian experiences
  of sound and silence shows how a local political aesthetic could transform the
  understanding of what and how Italian opera could communicate, helping to
  transmit a political message far beyond the walls of the opera house.</p>
