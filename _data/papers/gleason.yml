    <p>Anne C. Shreffler has called for studies of European and American Cold War composition in comparative context. One way to do so is to examine their respective receptions of the Second Viennese School. Gianmario Borio has been carrying out a reception history of the Darmstadt School’s analyses of modernist compositions. Thus far, however, the reception of the Viennese modernists by the Princeton School, arguably as ramified and complex, has failed to capture a comparable place in the historical imagination. This talk seeks to redress this imbalance.</p>
    <p>David Lewin’s unpublished 1958 chamber orchestra composition, <em>Essay on a Subject by Webern</em>, utilizes the canonic theme from Webern’s String Quartet op. 28, mvt. 2 (1938). In the same year Lewin’s piece was composed, he, Godfrey Winham, and J. K. Randall graduated with MFA degrees under Milton Babbitt at Princeton University, and Karlheinz Stockhausen’s analysis of the Webern movement appeared in the English translation of <em>Die Reihe</em>. Soon thereafter Randall penned an unpublished critique of Stockhausen’s analysis. These responses to Webern’s movement show it served as a tense site of negotiation, one against which we may understand Cold War Webern reception analytically and compositionally.</p>
    <p>After outlining these receptions of Webern’s movement, I situate the post-War analyzing and composing at Darmstadt and Princeton as the principal competitors for the serial legacy, arguing that <em>total</em> serialism was less important for the Americans than it was for the Europeans, which is partially responsible for the subsequent historiographical imbalance, one which prioritizes a cumulative approach to historical change.</p>
