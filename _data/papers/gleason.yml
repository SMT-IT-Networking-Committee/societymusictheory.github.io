      bio: |
        <p>Scott Gleason teaches at Columbia and New York universities, having received the PhD in music theory from Columbia. He edits for <em>Grove Music Online</em>, <em>The Open Space Magazine</em>, <em>Perspectives of New Music</em>, and formerly for <em>Current Musicology</em>. His writings appear in those publications and in <em>Filigrane: Musique, Esthétique, Sciences, Société</em>; <em>Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa</em>; <em>Notes: The Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association</em>; <em>Philosophy and the Public Realm</em>; <em>Tacet: Experimental Music Review</em>; and <em>Theoria: Historical Aspects of Music Theory</em>. He has presented his research in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. His research treats the history of music theory and the intersection of music and philosophy, and he writes analyses of new music. His first book project historicizes the Princeton School of composer-theorists, and his second presents experimental and improvised analyses of new musics.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>The oral history of music phenomenology in the United States tells us that it emerged in the early 1980s with writings by Judith Lochhead, Thomas Clifton, and, crucially, David Lewin&rsquo;s oft-cited 1986 article. Seemingly lost are the late 1960s and 1970s precedents for Lochhead, Clifton, and Lewin&rsquo;s work at Princeton University and published in the pages of <em>Perspectives of New Music</em>. This talk will uncover the style of writing, attention to listening and description, and the possibilities made available to music phenomenologists by the Princeton composer-theorists.</p>
    <p>Recoverable from the Princeton School&rsquo;s phenomenological writings is the point that <em>through</em> description one comes to understand how the experiencing subject changes the objects of investigation; this is a feature of Benjamin Boretz&rsquo;s writings. Through analysis one creates <em>theory</em>, but theory as the mindset or set of ideas through which one hears a span of music, a notion articulated by Joseph Dubiel. The result is an investigation into musical experience, but also musical &ldquo;cognition&rdquo; and even musical time. Hearing &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; requires musical time to decelerate; hence in 1976 Boretz, for one, writes his piano piece, &ldquo;(&lsquo;&hellip;my chart shines where the blue milks upset&hellip;&rsquo;),&rdquo; in order that he may <em>undergo</em> the experiences he has composed, an idea noted by J. K. Randall. Phenomenological <em>method</em>, however, was downplayed as these musical thinkers moved away from musical discourse as a science.</p>
    <p>As music phenomenology becomes a growing area of scholarship, a major fount of its discourse in North America requires re-examination.</p>---
