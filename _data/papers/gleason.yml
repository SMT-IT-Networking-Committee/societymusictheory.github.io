    <p>The oral history of music phenomenology in the United States tells us that it emerged in the early 1980s with writings by Judith Lochhead, Thomas Clifton, and, crucially, David Lewin&rsquo;s oft-cited 1986 article. Seemingly lost are the late 1960s and 1970s precedents for Lochhead, Clifton, and Lewin&rsquo;s work at Princeton University and published in the pages of <em>Perspectives of New Music</em>. This talk will uncover the style of writing, attention to listening and description, and the possibilities made available to music phenomenologists by the Princeton composer-theorists.</p>
    <p>Recoverable from the Princeton School&rsquo;s phenomenological writings is the point that <em>through</em> description one comes to understand how the experiencing subject changes the objects of investigation; this is a feature of Benjamin Boretz&rsquo;s writings. Through analysis one creates <em>theory</em>, but theory as the mindset or set of ideas through which one hears a span of music, a notion articulated by Joseph Dubiel. The result is an investigation into musical experience, but also musical &ldquo;cognition&rdquo; and even musical time. Hearing &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; requires musical time to decelerate; hence in 1976 Boretz, for one, writes his piano piece, &ldquo;(&lsquo;&hellip;my chart shines where the blue milks upset&hellip;&rsquo;),&rdquo; in order that he may <em>undergo</em> the experiences he has composed, an idea noted by J. K. Randall. Phenomenological <em>method</em>, however, was downplayed as these musical thinkers moved away from musical discourse as a science.</p>
    <p>As music phenomenology becomes a growing area of scholarship, a major fount of its discourse in North America requires re-examination.</p>---
