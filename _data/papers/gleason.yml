      bio: |
        <p>Scott Gleason received the PhD in music theory from Columbia University. Having taught at Columbia, Fordham, and New York universities, currently he co-chairs the Society for Music Theory’s History of Theory Interest Group and serves as Council Representative to the American Musicological Society Greater New York Chapter. He edits for <em>Grove Music Online</em> (Oxford University Press), <em>The Open Space Magazine</em>, <em>Perspectives of New Music</em>, and formerly for <em>Current Musicology.</em> Gleason’s writings appear in those publications and in <em>Filigrane</em>, <em>Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa</em>, <em>Notes, Philosophy and the Public Realm</em>, <em>Tacet</em>, and <em>Theoria</em>. His research treats the history of music theory and the intersection of music and philosophy, and he writes analyses of new musics. His book project historicizes the Princeton School of composer-theorist-improvisers, and recently he took up the bass guitar again, performing and learning music ranging from free jazz to singer-songwriter music to Congolese soukous and Senegalese mbalax.</p>

abstract: | 
    <p>Anne C. Shreffler has called for studies of European and American Cold War composition in comparative context. One way to do so is to examine their respective receptions of the Second Viennese School. Gianmario Borio has been carrying out a reception history of the Darmstadt School’s analyses of modernist compositions. Thus far, however, the reception of the Viennese modernists by the Princeton School, arguably as ramified and complex, has failed to capture a comparable place in the historical imagination. This talk seeks to redress this imbalance.</p>
    <p>David Lewin’s unpublished 1958 chamber orchestra composition, <em>Essay on a Subject by Webern</em>, utilizes the canonic theme from Webern’s String Quartet op. 28, mvt. 2 (1938). In the same year Lewin’s piece was composed, he, Godfrey Winham, and J. K. Randall graduated with MFA degrees under Milton Babbitt at Princeton University, and Karlheinz Stockhausen’s analysis of the Webern movement appeared in the English translation of <em>Die Reihe</em>. Soon thereafter Randall penned an unpublished critique of Stockhausen’s analysis. These responses to Webern’s movement show it served as a tense site of negotiation, one against which we may understand Cold War Webern reception analytically and compositionally.</p>
    <p>After outlining these receptions of Webern’s movement, I situate the post-War analyzing and composing at Darmstadt and Princeton as the principal competitors for the serial legacy, arguing that <em>total</em> serialism was less important for the Americans than it was for the Europeans, which is partially responsible for the subsequent historiographical imbalance, one which prioritizes a cumulative approach to historical change.</p>
