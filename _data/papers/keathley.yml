  <p>If her appearance in <i>Frida</i> (2002) brought the Mixtec-American
  singer, composer, and anthropologist Lila Downs (b. 1969) to the attention of
  Anglo-American audiences, her song <i>El Demagogo</i> (The Demagogue, 2016)
  showed her political commitments to be commensurate with her transnational
  identity and musical hybridity. Premiering at the October 2016 “Rise Up As
  One” concert on the Tijuana-San Diego border, this song pointedly calls out
  Donald Trump as “a white devil who thinks he is king of the world [and] buys
  and sells hate as a business,” comparing him to past dictators, and repeating
  the words “NO A ESE MURO” (No to that border wall). </p>
  <p>The not-yet-voluminous scholarship on Downs remarks on her syncretic mix of
  Mexican, US, Latin, and global music genres and styles; her socially conscious
  songs that sympathize with indigenous people, women, and migrants; her visual
  and textual markers of indigeneity; and her varied and expressive uses of her
  voice. What appears under-appreciated is the artful way her music supports a
  fierce, feminist oppositional politics within and beyond Mexico. Her 2015 CD
  <i>Balas y Chocolate</i> (Bullets and Chocolate) weaves themes of the Day of
  the Dead ceremony across the varied songs to create a coherent, vigorous,
  extended musico-poetic statement opposing greed, corruption, violence, and
  environmental degradation: the songs “Humito de Copal” (Copal Smoke), “Balas y
  Chocolate,” and “La patria madrina” (Motherland), for example, air grievances
  about the assassinations of muckraking journalists, child migration, and the
  government-involved murder of forty-three student teachers, all in danceable
  rhythms and musically satisfying arrangements.</p>
  <p><i>Borderlands/La Frontera</i> (1987) by Chicana feminist theorist Gloria
  Anzaldúa (1942–2002) is frequently cited in scholarship on transnational music
  and identity, yet seldom in ways that recognize the significance of its
  subtitle: <i>The New Mestiza</i>. Anzaldúa posited the rise of a woman of
  mixed cultures, languages, and identities, with “a new <i>mestiza</i>
  consciousness, <i>una conciencia de mujer</i>, a consciousness of the
  Borderlands.” It is this figure who is conjured by the oppositional voice of
  Lila Downs.</p>
