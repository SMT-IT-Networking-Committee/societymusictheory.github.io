    <p>The striking opening of British twelve-tone composer Elisabeth Lutyens’s <em>The Valley of Hatsuse</em>, Op. 62 (1965) highlights several key elements of her compositional style: dramatic registral explorations, an abundance of “altered octaves,” and a remarkable textural clarity. These features contribute to the highly gestural character of this opening passage, imparting a distinctive vibrancy to the sonic space—a quality consistent across Lutyens’s oeuvre. In this paper, I draw on performer-oriented, gesture-based, and embodied perspectives (Leong 2019; Kozak 2020; Cox 2016; De Souza 2018) to propose “performative effort” as a lens for centering these crucial gestural facets of Lutyens’s music. Performative effort arises through the enaction of gestures within particular instrumental or vocal spaces, and it is shaped by the various positionalities of performers and listeners. Because performative effort can encompass a wide range of affects, I outline several specific “effort qualities” that arise through a number of musical and gestural characteristics. I illustrate four such qualities—extension, precarity, discontinuity, and release—via analytical readings drawn from <em>The Valley of Hatsuse</em>. By integrating these analyses with more traditional aspects of twelve-tone analysis, I place performative effort as central to understanding experiential, embodied, and compositional facets of Lutyens’s music, inviting consideration of the relationships between performer, listener, and composer in analysis.</p>
