abstract: |
    <p>Many theorists have investigated how composers express tonal archetypes using expansions (e.g., internal repetition or interpolation) and contractions (e.g., omission or elision). However, the matter is seldom approached from the perspective of text-setting. How do composers use these techniques to highlight ideas, imagery, or atmosphere in texted music?</p>
    <p>I explore this question by investigating text-music correspondences in Schumann’s op. 39 <em>Liederkreis</em>. A novel feature of my approach is that I argue for the existence of stock musico-poetic pairings, which I call <em>correspondence complexes</em>. By considering individual correspondences as inter-related under the aegis of various text-musical <em>topoi</em>, my approach addresses Agawu’s long-standing criticism that musico-poetic analyses are “one-off” and “ad hoc” (1999).</p>
    <p>I show how musico-poetic meaning may arise in Schumann’s songs when textual elements are coordinated with one of two categories of musical elements. In the first case, the correspondence involves extraneous material that is added in some way to the underlying tonal framework (i.e., something that <em>shouldn’t</em> to be there—but <em>is</em>); in the second, the correspondence involves tonal material that is implied or conceptually present, albeit unrealized or else literally absent in the score, (i.e., something that <em>should to</em> be there—but <em>isn’t</em>).</p>
