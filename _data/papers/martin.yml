abstract: |
  <p>In his notorious late screed “Rameau oder Beethoven” (1930), Schenker
  excoriated Rameau for having sown “the seeds of death” in music theory by
  “reducing all musical progressions to fundamental basses and the progressions
  proper to them.” The stark antitheses drawn in that text—“French mediocrity”
  vs. “German genius,” “creeping paralysis” vs. “spiritual life”—are nuanced
  somewhat if Schenker’s earlier remarks in <i>Counterpoint I </i>(1910) and
  <i>Harmony</i> (1906) are taken into account. Indeed, Schenker’s later
  anti-<i>ramiste</i> polemicizing blatantly contradicts his analytical practice
  in those early texts: For on various occasions, Schenker silently deploys
  fundamental-bass analyses that emphasize root motion by fifth and third,
  whether the fundamental bass is shown—Rameau-fashion—on a third stave below
  the musical surface, or written in <i>à la Sechter</i> with note names and
  Roman numerals—in short, the very music-analytical technologies first
  articulated by that self-same, much defamed Rameau. But the ironies flow in
  the other direction as well. Rameau’s own account of harmonic motion,
  developed most exhaustively in the <i>Dissertation sur les différentes
  méthodes d’accompagnement </i>(1732), takes the descending-fifth sequence
  understood as a series of interlocking evaded cadences—the <i>enchaînement des
  dominantes </i>of the <i>Nouveau systême </i>(1726)—as its basic conceptual
  model. Yet this model in fact proves inadequate to much of Rameau’s own
  compositional practice, a practice that can perhaps be most compellingly
  elucidated using the graphical techniques of Schenkerian voice-leading
  reduction.</p>
