    <p>This paper investigates the hermeneutical implications of passages
    where major V is followed, and prolonged, by minor II. The seeming breach
    of tonal syntax creates a perceived ebb in tonal flow and gives the
    impression that V has somehow turned inward. By analogy to origami, I call
    this family of V prolongations a <i>dominant sink fold</i>; the
    <i>Oberquintteiler</i> here is a II, or <i>sunken II chord</i>. Because of
    their special voice-leading properties and inward affect, IIs possess
    unique potential for creating text-music correspondences. I will examine
    the role of IIs in three works by Robert Schumann, where they are
    meaningfully coordinated with moments of introspection and heightened
    subjectivity.</p>

    <p>In “Der Nussbaum,” Mosen’s poetry concerns blossoms coquettishly
    gossiping about a young maiden’s impending marriage, but the focus shifts to
    the maiden’s inner world and sexual naiveté in stanza 4. Schumann’s G-major
    setting (op. 25/3) renders this stanza in A minor <i>qua</i> II at the
    middleground level. Similarly, in “Berg’ und Burgen” (Heine), the objective
    river scenery recedes before the subjective heartbreak of the poem’s
    protagonist. In Schumann’s op. 24/7, the climactic line <i>Birgt sein</i>
    <i>Innres Tod und Nacht</i> (conceals [the river’s] inner Death and Night)
    brings the music to a II: PAC that functions as II, elaborating a
    fourth-progression within the structural dominant.</p>

    <p>The appearance of II is especially provocative in
    <i>Charakterstücke</i>, where poetic content is adumbrated by title alone.
    In my final example, I will argue that a II lies at the expressive heart
    of <i>Träumerei</i> (op. 15/7).</p>
