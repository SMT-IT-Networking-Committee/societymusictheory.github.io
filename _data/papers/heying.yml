abstract: |
  <p>For decades, an inordinate number of women composers and inventors
  associated with electronic and computer music have been marginalized in or
  forced out of the studios and universities that supported such methods of
  music-making. To use sociologist Nirmal Puwar’s phrase, they were considered
  “space invaders,” outsiders, strangers in the very institutions that served as
  professional and creative havens for their male counterparts.</p>
  <p>Faced with daily discrimination, often in coded language or couched as
  aesthetic preferences, verbal and even sexual harassment, and importantly,
  faced with little or no job prospects, women of certain means were able to
  leave such academic or commercial institutions to start their own studios or
  businesses to pursue their creative practices. </p>
  <p>In this paper I examine four case studies: Daphne Oram (1925–2003), one of
  the founding managers of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop who left to establish a
  home studio to compose and create the Oramics System synthesizer; Wendy Carlos
  (b. 1939), while studying at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center
  created a home studio outfitted with a custom Moog synthesizer and modified
  recording system to create original compositions including film scores; Carla
  Scaletti (b. 1956), who left academia, specifically the University of
  Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, to start the Symbolic Sound Corporation in order
  to develop and market the Kyma System, the music programming language she
  created; and Tara Rodgers (b. 1978), who left academia to pursue a career as
  an electronic musician and independent scholar. </p>
  <p>The purpose of this paper is to examine and understand the mechanisms of
  power and discrimination that worked and continue to work to keep the
  institutions that support the creation and pedagogy of electronic music
  homosocial, male-dominated spaces. I investigate these case studies to
  demonstrate the particular challenges of working outside established
  institutions of their fields, and ultimately, how abandoning such institutions
  provided these women with spaces of aesthetic, technical, and social freedom
  that enabled them to thrive. I will rely on personal and published interviews,
  archival materials, and scholarship by feminist theorist Sara Ahmed,
  musicologists Louis Niebur, anthropologist Roshanak Kheshti, and sound
  scholars Tara Rodgers and Jonathan Sterne. </p>
