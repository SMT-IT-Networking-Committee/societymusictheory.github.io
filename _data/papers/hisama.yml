    <p>In comparison with AMS and SEM, SMT remains a starkly male-identified
    society. According to the SMT’s 2018 annual report on demographics of its
    membership, 33.4 percent of SMT members self-identified as women—a figure
    that has not changed significantly over the last five years—in comparison
    to 51.2 percent of AMS members and 52.2 percent of SEM members. The NORC
    Survey of Earned Doctorates indicates that in 2013-2016, 26.4 percent of
    US PhDs in music theory and composition were women, marking a notable
    increase from 18.9 percent for the previous five-year period but hardly
    giving us bragging rights. The continued paucity of women, trans, and
    non-binary gender music theorists should be a huge concern to the Society.
    Demographic diversity is not only an issue of equity, but also yields
    innovation in research that enriches the field. As psychologists Abigail
    Stewart and Virginia Valian assert, “different interests and experiences
    give rise to different perspectives and ideas.”</p>
    <p>Drawing on insights from women scholars and scholars of color in
    classics and philosophy, as well as reflections from and about female
    music theorists, this paper considers the importance of rethinking what
    gets to count as music theory; the necessity for some scholars of finding
    disciplinary homes outside music theory; and the possibility of doing
    music theoretical work that, in feminist writer Sara Ahmed’s words, “is in
    touch with the world.”</p>
