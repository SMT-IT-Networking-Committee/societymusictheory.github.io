  <p>Writing in the wake of 1968, critic Louis-Jean Calvet observed that during
  periods of revolutionary upheaval people seldom sing songs born of the moment.
  “One always sings the previous revolution” he declared, his remark echoing
  Marx’s claim (in the <i>Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i>) that in
  “epochs of revolutionary crisis [the living] anxiously conjure up the spirits
  of the past to their service.” The event that prompted Calvet’s reflections,
  the uprising of May-June 1968 in France, appeared to bear out his claim. If any
  music can be said to have provided the soundtrack to the street protests and
  strike actions of May ’68, it was not so much contemporary <i>chanson</i> or
  jazz, but songs drawn from the established canon of late nineteenth- and
  early-twentieth-century <i>chanson révolutionnaire</i>, most notably the
  “Internationale,” ritualistically intoned at the meetings, marches, and rallies
  that animated the movement.</p>
  <p>This paper considers music’s perceived belatedness with regard to May-June
  1968. More specifically, it considers the anxieties that this perception
  aroused in musicians, and the strategies that were developed to mitigate the
  troubling sense that the time of musical production was out of step with that
  of revolutionary action—what Peter Schmelz has described as the sentiment that
  music in general and art music in particular “tends to lag behind history.” Of
  note is the incorporation of field recordings made during the uprising of
  May-June ’68 into music produced after the fact. An examination of two works
  created in the months following May ’68—Guy Reibel’s and François Bayle’s mixed
  media composition <i>Rumeurs</i> and Colette Magny’s song “Nous sommes le
  pouvoir” (We are the power)—sheds light on how “sound documents” (to borrow
  Andrea Bohlman’s term) were deployed to confer sociopolitical authority upon
  music and musician alike. Construed as a way of collapsing the distance
  separating musical action from political action, recourse to documentary
  recordings in these pieces also sheds light on a different kind of politics at
  play around May ’68: the politics of music’s presumed separation from politics.
