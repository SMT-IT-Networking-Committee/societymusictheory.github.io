  <p>As “the most profoundly confusing” of all arts, music was dismissed by
  figurehead André Breton as irrelevant to the Surrealist movement. Yet many
  composers were keenly involved in such Parisian circles. Poulenc’s
  acquaintance with major figures led him to set much of their literary work,
  but his engagement with their methods extends deeper into the structures of
  the music itself. Through assessing Poulenc’s flirtation with the movement’s
  various methods and ideas, this paper will build a method of conceptualizing
  Surrealism in music. For both Apollinaire and Breton, Surrealism focuses on
  the juxtaposition of familiar clichéd expressions in bizarre contexts, that
  is, “the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously
  neglected associations” (Breton 1924). Thus my theoretical point of entry will
  be Hatten’s conception of musical markedness, used to explore various ways
  through which markedness <i>itself </i>can be central to such an aesthetic.
  The familiar yet flexible musical type of fifth relations will provide an
  avenue into these concepts.</p>
  <p>I focus on three major works. <i>Litanies à la Vierge Noire</i> exemplifies
  a basic juxtaposition of languages, the basis of collage. An overdose of
  cadential progressions from the <i>Sextet</i> parallels Apollinaire’s
  conception of semantically saturated calligrams. Finally, the <i>Concerto for
  Organ, Strings and Timpani</i> demonstrates more formal concerns: the source
  of an initially marked “rogue” chord is gradually rationalized over the work.
  In situating these examples within recent work on genre, I develop a continuum
  of musical markedness, bringing together the various strands which
  characterize the musical Surreal.</p>
