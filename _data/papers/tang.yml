abstract: |
  <p>In October 1875, the British impresario Dave Carson’s “Minstrels,”
  according to the <i>North China Daily News</i>, presented a several
  performances in the Shanghai Lyceum Theatre. Their program was a kaleidoscopic
  mixture of (among other things) songs, farces, numbers from Offenbach’s
  operettas and excerpts from grand opera. Thus the exact function of Carson’s
  troupe is hard to categorize. Their appearance in Shanghai raises the question
  of how Western opera was actually received and practiced in this Treaty Port
  city, particularly in its autonomous European communities.</p>
  <p>I offer three perspectives to approach this question: (1) The appearances
  of the Carson troupe indicate how opera often operated “informally” in
  Shanghai, in contrast, for example, with opera staged in complete versions. In
  fact, as I will show, it was a common practice for Western opera companies to
  mix opera with other theatrical practices. Fully understanding Western opera
  in Shanghai requires accommodating such “impurities” of genre. (2)
  Advertisements for Western opera appeared in the <i>North China Daily News</i>
  together with advertisements for other Western goods. Opera was thus a luxury
  commodity in Shanghai. Traders, who made up the majority of European
  residents, organized amateur operatic activities in a club (the Amateur
  Dramatic Club) and ran the Lyceum Theatre, the only venue for performance in
  the city. In the context of a semi-colonized treaty port, their practices
  exposed a particular aesthetic approach to opera, which they viewed as a form
  of commercial entertainment. (3) Shanghai’s Western opera community was a node
  in a global (maritime) network through which Western musical theatre
  circulated. But as many recent studies indicate, this network also transported
  dramatic arts from colonized areas in Asia, such as Cantonese opera and Parsee
  opera. In order to understand Western opera’s prestige in Shanghai, I will
  examine how structures of the British Empire (as hegemonic power in the
  region) dominated and intervened in such processes of circulation. </p>
