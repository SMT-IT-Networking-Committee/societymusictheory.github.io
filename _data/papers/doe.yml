  <p>Marie-Antoinette’s idealized recreations of country life have remained an
  enduring facet of her reputation and symbol of the problems of her image. In
  her private retreat at the Petit Trianon, the queen strolled in meandering
  English gardens, wore informal muslin gowns, and constructed her famed
  “hamlet,” a pseudo-Norman village replete with a mill, dairy, and farm. If
  these endeavors constituted a “three-dimensional realization” of the themes of
  contemporary pastoral literature (Martin 2011), the enactment of such tropes
  also took place on a literal level—in the rustic opéras-comiques that
  Marie-Antoinette commissioned and performed at her theater on the palace
  grounds. In this collection of activities, the queen provocatively
  reconfigured ideals of royal display, in ways that both asserted her
  burgeoning authority and became mired in criticism and debate. </p>
  <p>This paper examines the pastoral operas supported by the Bourbon regime in
  the 1770s and 1780s, contextualizing their import within the larger framework
  of aristocratic paysannerie and unpacking the issues they raised for the
  cultivation of the royal image. The opéras-comiques presented at the Petit
  Trianon were condemned not merely for their subversive themes, but also for
  the manner in which they broke with longstanding expectations of monarchical
  accessibility; these productions garnered reproach because they were exclusive
  and insular, momentarily removing the mechanisms of court entertainment from
  public view. However, even as these performances came under fire for their
  secrecy, they exerted a substantial impact on the spectacles offered for
  broader consumption by the crown-affiliated theaters of Paris.
  Counterbalancing the theatricals of the Petit Trianon was a corpus of
  extravagant “public” pastorals—works calculated to neutralize the negative
  publicity elicited by Marie-Antoinette’s withdrawal into her private, country
  realm. This repertory—by Grétry, Dezède, and Martini, among others—portrays a
  host of noblemen benevolently immersed in the lives of their common subjects,
  affirming the hierarchical and heavily symbolic bonds between peasant and
  seigneur. Despite their “crown-approved” morals, these latter operas were
  themselves not without controversy, provoking questions regarding the limits
  of upward mobility for “rustic” opéra-comique—and regarding the genre’s
  ultimately uneasy fit within the machinery of Bourbon propaganda. </p>
