    <p>Few composers sparked more controversy in the eighteenth century than Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. His short Intermezzo, <em>La serva padrona,</em> famously was at the center of the <em>Querelle des Bouffons</em>, which rocked France at mid-century. Less well known, though, was a controversy caused by his <em>Stabat mater</em> among German listeners, one that involved seemingly parochial issues of meter and text placement. By situating this debate within the cultural-historical context of late 18<sup>th</sup>-century music theory and aesthetics in Germany, particularly in Berlin, I hope to show that the issues at hand went far beyond surface questions of text setting and phrasing; the discussions betray deep-seated nationalistic sentiments.</p>
    <p>The theoretical debate surrounding Pergolesi’s music in the eighteenth century was made possible by a new space of discourse that fundamentally transformed the role of music in society: the public sphere in which musical issues could be debated, particularly in periodicals. In various German periodicals through the end of the century German musicians such as Schulz, Marpurg, Dittersdorf, Forkel, and Spazier engaged in spirited debates over aspects of Pergolesi’s <em>Stabat mater.</em> For example, in response to Schulz calling the work “very erroneous and poor,” Marpurg accused Schulz of bias and ignorance regarding metrical feet in Latin. Marpurg then invoked and ridiculed Schulz’s notoriously conservative teacher Kirnberger. This drawn-out polemic provides a fascinating case study of the way that a seemingly limited problem of music theory can become a subject of discourse in the broader public sphere with larger aesthetic and even political ramifications.</p>
