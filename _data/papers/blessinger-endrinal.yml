title: "The \"Ahhs\" Have It: Wordless Melismas and the Ineffable in Popular Music"
handouts: []
abstract: |
    <p>In his 2010 <i>Popular Music</i> article, songwriter Pete Astor defends
    the discursive and emotive primacy of lyrics: “There is for me a greater
    value to those compositions with lyrics, a sense that the material that
    contains the greatest level of emotional commitment is always that where
    words are employed…” On the other hand, Johan Fornäs argues that “the
    text/music dichotomy is an illusion. They are not each other’s Other.”
    This raises a tantalizing question: What of music that is performed by the
    human voice, yet nonverbal?</p>
    <p>This presentation explores such music, specifically how extended passages
    of nonverbal singing in popular music—“wordless melismas” (WMs)—help the voice
    transcend the expressive limits of the verbal and assume the apparently
    ineffable qualities of the instrumental. WMs are monosyllabic passages found
    in their own musically distinct section, usually bridges or concluding
    sections. Songs may have recurring or multiple different WMs. Additionally,
    WMs are not background elements, nor are they repeated (and often nonsensical)
    syllables like “na na” or “sha-la-la.” From these criteria, we have
    extrapolated four functions WMs fulfill within a song’s form and narrative,
    the details and examples of which we expound upon in greater detail in the
    presentation: introductory (“Welcome to the Jungle,” Guns N’ Roses),
    conclusive (“Criminal,” Fiona Apple), transformative (“You Oughta Know,”
    Alanis Morissette), and climactic (“With Or Without You,” U2). In each of
    these cases, the voice occupies a previously unexplored border region between
    the vocal and the instrumental, the verbal and the ineffable.</p>
