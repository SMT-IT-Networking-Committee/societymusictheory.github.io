abstract: |
  <p>Crossover arrangements of classical music have introduced repertoire to
  audiences far beyond the concert hall. With examples ranging from Wendy
  Carlos’s <i>Switched on Bach</i> to the disco hit “A Fifth of Beethoven” and
  Isao Tomita’s electronic version of Holst’s <i>The Planets</i>, listeners have
  experienced eclectic interpretations of established masterpieces, as Matthew
  Brown reveals in <i>Debussy Redux</i> (2012).</p>
  <p>Despite the popularity of works including the <i>Pavane pour une infante
  défunte</i> (made famous by Frank Sinatra as “The Lamp is Low”) and the String
  Quartet (featured in commercial advertising), the relocation of Maurice
  Ravel’s music to the popular sphere has been overlooked, along with a
  distinguished recorded legacy. With <i>Boléro</i> (1928), among the best-known
  classical compositions in history, the scholarly lacuna is especially
  pronounced. Featured in dozens of recordings, several films, and adapted by a
  plethora of artists and groups, the work has also served as a soundtrack to
  events including international sports competitions and flash mobs.</p>
  <p>Despite its ubiquity, many facets of <i>Boléro</i> remain elusive,
  including its tempo, status within the modern arts, and connections to Ravel’s
  estate and final illness. The composer’s own comments reveal puzzling
  inconsistencies. Referring to the work in a 1931 interview as “orchestral
  tissue without music,” he nevertheless took a keen interest in its performance
  as the ideal realization of his compositional goals and excoriated those—most
  famously Toscanini—who deviated from a prescribed interpretation.</p>
  <p>This poster charts ten key recordings spanning the 1930s to the present,
  including those conducted or supervised by the composer as well as
  interpretations by Benny Goodman, Jack Hylton, and Frank Zappa. I reassess
  Ravel’s singular conflation of melody, pacing, timbre, and exoticism as
  characteristics tailor-made for, and amplified by, the recorded medium. The
  poster format allows for especially rich connections to be drawn among these
  diverse elements. As a Janus-like creation mirroring the <i>espagnolade</i> of
  the composer’s early years and ahead to a leaner music of his final period,
  the work reflects postmodern pluralism rather than a single, definitive
  statement. At the same time, idiosyncratic arrangements accentuate Ravel’s
  longstanding use of irony, artificiality, and grief.</p>
