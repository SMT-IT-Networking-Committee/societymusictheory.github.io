    <p>This paper proposes a performer-oriented methodology for analyzing contemporary music for the shamisen, a Japanese three-stringed lute-like instrument. While a number of studies on shamisen music focus on pitch- and rhythm-based similarities to categorize idiomatic melodic patterns (Machida 1983; Tokita 2000), others de-emphasize pitch to argue that performers are more concerned with timbre and performance technique (Ōtsuka 1989; Schmuckal 2016). I build upon the two threads by analyzing <em>neo</em> (2014)—a piece for solo shamisen by Dai Fujikura—through the concept of <em>te</em>, a term used by shamisen players to refer to recurring melodic patterns and their characteristic fingerings, hand positions, and performance techniques. Through aural and visual analysis of performances by Hidejiro Honjoh—the shamisen player for whom <em>neo</em> was written—I demonstrate how the form of <em>neo</em> unfolds through changes in the performer’s use of <em>te</em>. By adopting a <em>te-</em>based approach, I expand the scope of pitch- and rhythm-based analysis to highlight the interactions between form, gesture, and timbre in contemporary shamisen performance.</p>
    <p>My analysis of <em>te </em>challenges the universalizing reach of Western music theoretical methods in non-Western music analysis. I argue that <em>te </em>represents an “invisible” music theory (Tokumaru 2008) that is not explicitly theorized in writing but forms the foundation of performers’ understanding of shamisen music. Weaving together the music theoretical work of performers and scholars on shamisen music as well as North American theories of fretboard topography, this paper presents a case study of an intercultural methodology for analyzing contemporary shamisen music.</p>
