abstract: |
    <p>My paper examines how shō player Miyata Mayumi’s considerations of
    dynamics, articulation, and sound-producing gestures in her solo performances
    contest the dichotomies of Japan/West and traditional/contemporary. While
    previous studies on the hybridization of traditional Japanese and contemporary
    Western music (Nuss 1996; Motegi 1999; Everett 2005) have focused primarily on
    compositional strategy, the contribution of performers has received little
    attention (Wade 2014). To fill this gap, I situate Miyata as an active agent
    in the shaping of a musical work (Lochhead 2016) to examine how her
    performances exhibit multiple forms of cultural hybridity. I analyze the
    intricate transcultural processes at work in two of Miyata’s recorded solo
    performances: <i>Hyōjō-no-chōshi</i>, a traditional dance prelude originally
    composed for tōgaku ensemble, and <i>One9</i> (1991), a collaborative piece
    between Miyata and John Cage.</p>
    <p>I argue that Miyata’s performance of <i>Hyōjō-no-chōshi</i>, which she has
    refashioned as a self-standing solo work, invites new expressive meanings for
    traditional repertoire. I draw attention to melodic, timbral, and gestural
    features within the shō part that would have been obscured in a traditional
    ensemble performance of a <i>chōshi.</i> Through spectrographic analysis, I
    demonstrate how Miyata’s execution of dynamics and articulation accentuates
    the <i>chōshi</i>’s melodic lines. My analysis of <i>One9</i> suggests that
    traditional pitch structures and fingering conventions inform the work’s time
    bracket meta-structure. By highlighting Miyata’s role as a key collaborator in
    the compositional process of the work, I contend that her performance creates
    an intercultural space shared between avant-garde and traditional Japanese
    music.</p>
