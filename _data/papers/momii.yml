    <p>This paper incorporates the physical gestures of performing the
    <i>shō</i>—a free-reed mouth organ—into an analysis of its
    <i>aitakē—</i>five- to six-note pitch clusters played by the <i>shō—to
    </i>explore the relationship between performance practice and modal theory
    in <i>gagaku</i>. I demonstrate that the idiosyncratic arrangement of the
    pipes on the <i>shō </i>is closely related to the pitch structure and
    tonal function of the <i>aitakē</i>.</p> 

    <p>My analysis synthesizes two approaches. First, I adopt David Lewin’s
    transformational attitude (1987) to focus on the processes of motion
    enacted by the <i>tē-utsuri</i>— standardized finger movements for
    shifting between two <i>aitakē</i>—rather than conceptualize the <i>aitakē
    </i>as static harmonic entities. Second, I treat the <i>aitakē </i>as
    sonic byproducts of a performer’s instrumental gestures to examine how
    each of the <i>aitakē </i>are related to one another kinesthetically, and
    whether these relationships correlate with the pitch structures of the
    <i>aitakē</i>.</p> 

    <p>Relatedness between <i>aitakē </i>is determined by the parsimony of the
    <i>tē-utsuri</i>. I demonstrate that the most parsimonious movements can be
    enacted between four <i>aitakē</i>: <i>bō</i>, <i>kotsu, ichi </i>and <i>otsu.
    </i>These <i>aitakē </i>are identical to the clusters that accompany the
    fundamental tones of five of the six modes: <i>Ichikotsu-chō</i>,
    <i>Hyōjō</i>, <i>Taishiki-chō</i>, Ō<i>shiki-chō </i>and <i>Banshiki-chō</i>.
    These findings demonstrate that the pipes of the <i>shō</i>, while seemingly
    arranged in no discernable order, prioritize parsimonious <i>tē-utsuri
    </i>between each of the <i>aitakē </i>accompanying the fundamental modal
    degrees. An analysis of the pitch structure of <i>aitakē </i>through
    <i>tē-utsuri </i>reveals a striking correlation between gestural parsimony and
    tonal function.</p>
