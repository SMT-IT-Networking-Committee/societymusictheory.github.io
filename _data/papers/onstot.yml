abstract: |
  <p>As the first and only sovereign queen of the Habsburg lands, Maria Theresa
  of Austria (1717–80) and her negotiation of a land steeped in male
  primogeniture, bears examination. Her reign raises questions of female
  rulership: what it looked like and how it functioned in eighteenth-century
  Austria. Drawing on ideas of self-affirmation and self-fashioning discussed by
  scholars such as Kristiaan Aercke, Melissa Hyde, Regina Schulte, and Michael
  Yonan, this paper explores the ways that Maria Theresa used music and court
  entertainments to portray certain monarchical images and support her rule.
  Building on scholarship of authors such as Gottfried Mraz and Barbara
  Stollberg-Rilinger, which studies the role of art and image within the
  Empress’ reign, this paper instead examines opera at court during her reign
  for moments of self-affirmation and self-fashioning. This in turn highlights
  some of the narratives of female rulership which she created and presented to
  her court and the world. </p>
  <p>Court entertainments, such as her birthday celebrations of 1748, offer a
  prime place to explore moments of self-fashioning. Gluck’s opera <i>Semiramide
  riconosciutta</i>, performed for the Empress’ birthday gala near the end of
  the War of Austrian Succession, presented to the court specific ideas of
  female queenship. This paper examines the history of the Semiramide tale and
  opera and traces its history at the Austrian court and its subsequent
  alterations for the 1748 birthday gala. While earlier versions of the tale
  often depict the historical Semiramide as violent and transgressive, the
  Metastasio libretto used in Gluck’s opera eschews these elements. The opera’s
  re-imagining of the Semiramide character as a moral, relatively rational, and
  self-sacrificing person emphasizes loyalty, fidelity, and relationships, and
  presents an ideal of female queenship. I argue that the move away from the
  traditional licentious narrative to a morally acceptable and love-driven plot
  was deliberate and indicates one way that court entertainments presented ideas
  of acceptable female rule. The elements of allegorical meaning and
  self-fashioning employed in this opera applies to other court entertainments
  and demonstrates some of the ways in which music and theater functioned in
  court life by disseminating ideas to court and the world.</p>
