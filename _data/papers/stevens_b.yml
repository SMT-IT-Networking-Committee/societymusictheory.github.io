abstract: |
    <p>Recent developments in <i>Formenlehre</i> have provided new insight
    into classical form (Caplin 1998; Hepokoski and Darcy 2006); however, such
    scholarship has tended to privilege Viennese classicism in its
    codification of ideal formal types and norms. For this reason, an
    uncritical application of such methods obscures rather than elucidates
    conventional practice when applied to works in parallel traditions. The
    occasional music-theoretic approaches to Spanish keyboard music (Powell
    1980; Sutcliffe 2014; Igoa Mateos 2014) of composers such as Vicente
    Rodríguez (1690–1760), Joaquín Oxinaga (1719–89), Sebastian Albero
    (1722–57), Félix Máximo López (1742–1821), Narciso Casanovas (1747–99),
    Manuel Blasco de Nebra (1750–83), and Joaquin Montero (1764–1815) have not
    accounted for the possibility of a<i> Formelehre</i> tradition parallel to
    that of Viennese classicism. This paper takes Blasco de Nebra’s <i>Seis
    sonatas para clave y fuerte-piano</i> (1780) as a point of departure in
    order to demonstrate how classical norms may be reexamined and reevaluated
    to account for such a collection in its own historical context.
    Retheorizing both thematic construction as well as sonata structure from
    the perspective of these Spanish sonatas provides better insight into
    these works than the presuming of some ideal (Austro-Germanic) sonata
    form. In this paper, I will outline the general formal features of Blasco
    de Nebra’s keyboard sonatas and provide examples of earlier and
    contemporary works in order to demonstrate how these same features—often
    atypical for the Viennese composers—are normative for the keyboard sonata
    in this region.</p>
