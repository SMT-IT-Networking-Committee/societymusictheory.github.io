abstract: |
  <p>This paper explores the music of pioneer “conjunto progressive” bandleader,
  composer, and accordionist David Lee Garza. Through his sonic and musical
  choices, a performance “formula” emerged that inspired a contemporary Tejano
  style unique to San Antonio. In his efforts to create a sound adhering to
  traditional elements of the conjunto style, Garza describes four important
  characteristics, or <i>pasadas</i>: passages recognizable to fans and fellow
  Tejano musicians as a cosmopolitan notion of modern Tejano musical tastes.
  These characteristics include: 1) echoing the accordion melody with saxophone;
  2) accordion countermelody in-between the lead singer’s stanzas; 3)
  alternation between the three-row button accordion (used in traditional
  conjuntos) and a customizable five-row model; and 4) recurring melodic
  gestures, or motives, among various textural combinations of accordion,
  saxophone, and keyboard. These motives include the accordion’s “stutter,”
  scalar ascent, and a sequential third followed by a step.</p>
