    <p>The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were times of immense social,
    cultural, and political change. Industrialization swept across Europe, driving
    workers into cities and transforming economies. Observing these trends in the
    eighteenth century, writers such as J.G. Herder and Jean-Jacques Rousseau
    advocated for a better understanding of mankind in its most “natural” state as
    an answer to the rapid urbanization and materialism of their worlds. This
    impulse manifested itself in the arts as an idealization of “naivety,” a
    concept so ubiquitous that it drew Voltaire’s satirical wit in <i>Candide.</i>
    Closely related to the era’s evolving ideas on childhood and ingenuousness,
    this idealization began to fade in the nineteenth century as Romantics
    prioritized intense expressivity and engagement with the raw emotional
    complexities of life. Naivety came to be seen in some corners as an
    irresponsible retreat from reality, reflective of childish immaturity.</p>
    <p>Writers on both sides of this redefinition of naivety positioned Joseph
    Haydn as the model “naïve” composer. Celebrated in his lifetime for his
    musical wit and sophistication, Haydn nonetheless was always closely
    associated with his unpretentious, rustic origins. For better or worse, this
    association had important implications for his reception history. </p>
    <p>This paper examines how several writers used the broad concept of naivety
    to promote their aesthetic and political goals, some of whom specifically
    centered their arguments on the figure of Haydn. W.H. Riehl, for example, saw
    Haydn’s unique naivety as an antidote to the alleged moral decay of
    nineteenth-century German society; Franz Brendel disparaged Haydn’s
    “childlike, naïve character” and his lack of engagement with “the dark abysses
    of human anguish,” reflecting his own view that music need be more than a mere
    “luxury of the educated classes.” Exploring how such figures engaged with
    these infrequently discussed notions of naivety sheds light on an important
    aesthetic trend of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and gives us new
    insight into Haydn’s complex reception history. </p>
