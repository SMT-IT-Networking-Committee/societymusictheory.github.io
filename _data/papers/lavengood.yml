      bio: |
        <p>Megan Lavengood is Assistant Professor and Area Director of Music Theory at George Mason University. Her primarily deals with popular music, timbre, synthesizers, and recording techniques. Her article on the iconic Yamaha DX7 electric piano sound appears in the Journal of Popular Music Studies. Her methodology for timbre analysis is described in a forthcoming article in Music Theory Online. Her current research projects focus on timbre in drum machines and acoustic percussion. As a pedagogue, she focuses on incorporating popular music as a step toward inclusivity of music students from non-traditional backgrounds. She has headed teams that won grants to redesign GMU’s core theory curriculum to be modular instead of sequential and to substantially expand the open educational resource Open Music Theory. She is also an active performer as a soprano in a Renaissance chamber ensemble.</p>

abstract: |
    <p>Within the widespread efforts to diversity the topics we teach our undergraduates, one model is a modular curriculum, in which theory courses are designed to be taken in any order, rather than in a strict sequence. Theory instructors generally seem enthusiastic about implementing modular curricula and giving students the option to take unconventional courses as part of their core curriculum, but textbooks continue to cater primarily to a conservative, traditional curriculum. My lightning talk demonstrates how to use the collaboratively authored <em>Open Music</em> <em>Theory</em> as the primary text for modular courses. <em>OMT2</em> contains six sections that go beyond a traditional curriculum: jazz, pop, 20th-/21st-c., counterpoint, form, and orchestration.</p>
    <p>Each of these sections has been authored by a specialist in that area. As <em>OMT2</em> continues to grow, further sections could easily be added that cater to other unconventional courses. A new potential problem arises with all open educational resources (OER): too much material may make the course material too difficult for an instructor to navigate, especially for adjunct and other under-supported instructors. Fortunately, OER Commons websites (community-based websites like Humanities Commons) provide an ideal platform for creating Instructor’s Guides on using <em>OMT2</em> for various courses. I will demonstrate how instructors can access OER Commons to find course structures and instructor resources for courses designed to use <em>OMT2</em> as their primary textbook. I will also instruct session participants in adding their own courses to <em>OMT2</em>’s OER Commons webpage.</p>
