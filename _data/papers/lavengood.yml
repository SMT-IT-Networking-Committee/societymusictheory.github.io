    <p>Within the widespread efforts to diversity the topics we teach our undergraduates, one model is a modular curriculum, in which theory courses are designed to be taken in any order, rather than in a strict sequence. Theory instructors generally seem enthusiastic about implementing modular curricula and giving students the option to take unconventional courses as part of their core curriculum, but textbooks continue to cater primarily to a conservative, traditional curriculum. My lightning talk demonstrates how to use the collaboratively authored <em>Open Music</em> <em>Theory</em> as the primary text for modular courses. <em>OMT2</em> contains six sections that go beyond a traditional curriculum: jazz, pop, 20th-/21st-c., counterpoint, form, and orchestration.</p>
    <p>Each of these sections has been authored by a specialist in that area. As <em>OMT2</em> continues to grow, further sections could easily be added that cater to other unconventional courses. A new potential problem arises with all open educational resources (OER): too much material may make the course material too difficult for an instructor to navigate, especially for adjunct and other under-supported instructors. Fortunately, OER Commons websites (community-based websites like Humanities Commons) provide an ideal platform for creating Instructor’s Guides on using <em>OMT2</em> for various courses. I will demonstrate how instructors can access OER Commons to find course structures and instructor resources for courses designed to use <em>OMT2</em> as their primary textbook. I will also instruct session participants in adding their own courses to <em>OMT2</em>’s OER Commons webpage.</p>
