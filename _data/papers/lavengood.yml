  <p>I articulate a new methodology for timbre analysis, which situates
  spectrogram analysis within a broad cultural context by taking direct account
  of listener experience, i.e., “perceptualization” (Fales 2002), through the
  notions of markedness (Hatten 1994). To this end, I propose timbral norms for
  instrumentational categories and suggest narratives that result from the
  transgression of these norms. I categorize sounds used in a given track into
  three groups, or <i>instrumentational categories</i>: (a) <i>core sounds</i>,
  which articulate structural aspects of pitch and rhythm of the song; (b)
  <i>melody sounds, </i>which are the voice and any instrument replacing the
  voice; or (c) <i>novelty sounds</i>, used primarily for coloristic effects.
  This paper focuses on 1980s popular music; my categorization therefore was
  determined by analysis of many 1980s singles. A correlation arises between the
  timbral characteristics of these instruments and their instrumentational
  category: the <i>core</i> and <i>melody</i> sounds share unmarked timbral
  properties, weaving into the groove’s fabric, rather than demanding attention.
  <i>Novelty</i> sounds are intrinsically difficult to generalize, but tend to
  feature marked timbral characteristics. Instances of subversion of timbral
  norms enables the analyst to locate musical meaning created through the
  manipulation of timbres. By showing a methodology to account for the vital
  role of timbre in this music’s narrative, my study demonstrates the utility of
  timbre analysis in music analysis at large.</p>
