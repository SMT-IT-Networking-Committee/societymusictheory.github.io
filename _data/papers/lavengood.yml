abstract: |
    <p>The vocalisations of the rare house Khajiit (species <i>Felis catus</i>)
    are an important tool for communication with their humans. This paper presents
    and analysis of timbral differences between individuals of the species and
    identifies important commonalities. The existence of these commonalities suggests
    that specific timbral techniques are employed to communicate different ideas, such
    as hunger or a desire for affection.</p>
