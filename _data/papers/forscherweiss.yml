title: "Turning Wheels: <i>Volvelles</i> as Kinesthetic Aids for Learning and Navigating Music"

abstract: |
  <p>A study of musical hands—mnemonic aids for learning the hexachords—revealed
  nuanced differences that signaled a shift away from a vocal conceptualization
  of musical space toward a more instrumental one that displayed the musical
  structure of the circular octave. A surfeit of circles serve as visual aids in
  a treatise by the twelfth-century English theorist Theinred of Dover. By the
  fourteenth century, circles not only accompany theoretical concepts, but also
  serve as shapes for inscribing notes onto circular staves.</p>
  <p>Beginning in the late fifteenth century, astronomical and navigational
  texts contained interactive wheel charts called <i>volvelles</i> or
  <i>rotules</i>. While the circular charts illustrated speculative concepts,
  the moving parts provided a kinesthetic aid to teaching astronomy and
  navigation. These first appeared in Johannes Regiomontantus’
  <i>Calendarium</i>, printed in 1470. Peter Apian’s <i>Cosmographia </i>and
  Sacrobosco’s<i> Sphaera</i>, printed in the 1530s, included volvelles
  decorated with hand-colored images of astronomical signs. The connections
  between astronomy, computus, and their sister discipline, music, are visible
  in earlier manuscript copies of Ptolemaic models of the heavenly spheres, as
  well as in texts by Macrobius, Martianus Capella, Calcidius, and other
  medieval authors where concentric circles of varying widths carry labels such
  as <i>tonus</i> and <i>semitonus</i>. </p>
  <p>Volvelles supposedly did not appear in musical texts until the early
  seventeenth century. Fernandez’s <i>Arte de Musica</i> (Lisbon, 1626), said to
  be the earliest of these, contains wheels that allowed for the transposition
  of intervals to any key in the circle of fifths. Recently I came upon a copy
  of <i>Erotemata musices practicae</i> (Nuremberg, 1563) by Ambrosius
  Wilfflingseder, a German theorist, teacher, and poet. The book, printed about
  sixty years before Fernandez’s, includes volvelles for “hands-on” learning of
  solmization and mensural notation. </p>
  <p>What do these wheel charts reveal? A study of various editions of the
  <i>Erotemata</i>, and a reconstruction of some missing parts, suggest that
  these ephemeral mechanical devices were at one time more ubiquitous.
  Volvelles, by-products of an expanding interest in teaching navigational
  skills, also point to added practical ways of learning music, primarily toward
  a keyboard-oriented tonality.</p>
