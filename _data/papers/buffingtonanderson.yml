abstract: |
  <p>Oscar Brown Jr.’s music, poetry, and theatrical works challenged generic
  boundaries within and across medias. An artist-activist of the Black Arts
  Movement, Brown developed a Black aesthetic strategy based in intertextuality,
  collaboration, and theatricality. Responding to his assemblage of medias,
  Amiri Baraka categorized Brown’s work as “poem-songs” or “song poems.” Within
  his performances, Brown manipulates musical genres and vocal timbre to move
  through various personas, presenting multiple and simultaneous Black
  identities.</p>
  <p>This essay explores Brown’s use of African American folk traditions and
  considers his aesthetics and politics within the context of the Black Arts
  Movement. Though often marginalized in discussions of Black Arts poetry and
  music, Brown’s weaving of speech and song precedes the development of the New
  Black Poetry as defined by Stephen Henderson. Additionally, Brown disrupts the
  hypermasculized Black identity central to notions of Black militancy and Black
  Power politics. I suggest that Brown’s polyvocality presents a layering of
  identities, which challenges singular notions of Black masculinity within the
  Black Power Era. Brown achieves this by moving through multiple vocal timbres,
  but also by reclaiming African American folk traditions such as street cries
  and hollers. I read and hear Brown’s poem-songs through Toni Morrison’s trope
  of “rememory” presented in her novel, <i>Beloved</i>. Brown’s use of African
  American folk tales and music can be understood as a reclamation of culture
  and heritage, which he uses not only to provide a memorial and record of these
  traditions, but also to connect them to Black Power politics.</p>
