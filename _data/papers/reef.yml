    <p>This paper identifies a compositional pattern in the music of J. S. Bach
    and demonstrates its operation in several fugal or imitative works, noting two
    key issues: that it challenges the exhaustivity of William Renwick’s
    exposition patterns in explaining the tonal structures of fugue expositions,
    and that the similarities among passages structured by this pattern may be
    accounted for in terms of “variation.”</p>
    <p>In this pattern, a descending upper-voice progression ^8–^7–^6–^5 is
    supported contrapuntally by parallel tenths and chordally through
    descending-fifth root motion. It is characterized by a sort of “retrogressive
    implication,” as harmonies slip away from dominant without a sense of
    resolution to tonic. This differs from the norm in fugue expositions, which is
    suggested by the I–V–I progressions that ground Renwick’s exposition patterns.
    Consequently, alternative explanations are necessary.</p>
    <p>This pattern is based on a more general voice-leading pattern common in the
    decades preceding Bach’s career. But there are some particularities in Bach’s
    usage: Bach associates it with the key of A minor, connects it consistently to
    formal events, and often uses similar motivic and phrase-rhythmic strategies
    as he navigates through it. The passages he constructs in this way betray a
    more obvious family resemblance than do passages structured by the earlier,
    more general version of the pattern. I suggest that these passages are best
    understood as “variations” of an “absent theme,” and that as Bach sometimes
    retraced his compositional steps, he resorted to strategies that had
    previously proven successful in negotiating his compositional pattern.</p>
