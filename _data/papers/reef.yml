    <p>A remarkable aspect of J. S. Bach’s music is his “energetic” shaping of melody and counterpoint within short (two- to four-measure) phrases. Through apparent enactments of various efforts, tensions, or motions within phrases, melodic/contrapuntal content may seem to resist, or even exceed, its “grouping” boundaries. To investigate such shaping, I situate inside Bach’s contrapuntal textures an imaginary musical “agency” that manipulates the voice leading, register, and tonal rhythm of prior units of tonal structure, on the one hand giving them distinction as groups, and on the other generating the energy by which they exceed their boundaries. Speculatively, I identify two essential ways in which this is accomplished. First, energetic tendencies may develop directly from the resolution of tonal and/or tonal-rhythmic tensions within a musical group and then manifest as “motivated” linear motion beyond that group. Second, they may develop through tensions left unresolved with in a group. These situations frequently involve gaps in register, as if representing an agential attempt to break free of an underlying linearity. Through analysis of selected generically favorable passages (e.g., from fugue expositions, dance suite movements, and/or concerto/aria ritornellos), I hope to expand our metaphorical understanding of musical motion and to develop the variety of narratives to which we appeal in our interpretations.</p>
