  <p>Studies of Spectralism tend to prioritize conceptual compositional
  structures while eliding the roles and experiences of performers. Yet one of
  the distinguishing features of Spectralism is its adaptation of the
  techniques of acousmatic music to a live performance context that requires
  physical gestures and acoustic instruments. For instance, the technique of
  “instrumental synthesis” amounts to the live orchestration of an abstract
  combination of sine tones originally created with magnetic tapes or software
  (Rose 1996).</p>
  <p>By contrast, this paper develops an “analysis from the body” (Fisher and
  Lochhead 2002) that considers the gestures of a violist, analyzed in still
  frames and video footage from a recorded performance (Simon and Rophé 2014),
  as central to musical form and meaning in Gérard Grisey’s <i>Prologue
  </i>(1976). My analysis begins from Grisey’s commentary on the piece, in which
  he defines music as a dialectic between excitation (<i>le délire</i>) and
  structure (<i>la forme</i>). Drawing on the work of Rolf Inge Godøy, I first
  relate <i>sound-producing gestures</i> to musical structure and consider how
  we perceive that structure through embodied simulations of sounds (Cox 2016).
  Second, I consider the <i>sound-accompanying</i> or <i>ancillary gestures</i>
  of performers—their body movements that do not directly map onto
  sounds—arguing that these actions convey the music’s expressive content and
  performers’ individual interpretations (Davidson 1994, 2005). The paper thus
  resituates Spectralism in the bodies of performers and the embodied minds of
  listeners and suggests a way to reconsider this repertoire as an expressive,
  embodied artform. </p>
