    <p>Meter is often framed as a binary distinction: either music is metric,
    or it is not. Boulez’s <i>Structures I</i> is not metric because it lacks
    the periodic rhythms and regular groupings that make Beethoven’s Fifth
    Symphony so clearly metric. This distinction pervades analytical and
    psychological approaches to musical rhythm. In metric music, theorists
    analyze grouping and conflict while psychologists discuss entrainment and
    well-formedness rules. In non-metric contexts, theorists consider
    durational patterns and alternative temporalities, while psychologists
    ponder the limits of temporal discernment. Yet numerous edge cases
    complicate the issue. For instance, the music of Gérard Grisey sometimes
    references meter while simultaneously exhibiting meter-confounding
    conflicts. These rhythms, I argue, are filtered through our propensity for
    entrainment and our associations with familiar meters in perception. Thus,
    this music occupies a liminal space—a <i>nearly-metric space</i>—between
    metric and non-metric experiences.</p>
    <p>This paper proposes four types of nearly-metric spaces—partial, hollow,
    distorted, and sporadic meters—in a case study analysis of Grisey’s
    <i>Vortex Temporum</i> I, II, III (1994–96). Building on treatments of
    meter as a temporal orientation (Ito 2013), a learned schema (London 2012),
    and a set of potential expectations (Hasty 1997), I argue that meter serves
    as an a priori for rhythmic perception in <i>Vortex Temporum</i>.
    Ultimately, I aim to bring the findings and methods of metric cognition and
    analysis, originally developed for tonal music, to bear on the complex
    rhythms of recent concert music and to add nuance to our distinction
    between metric and non-metric experiences.</p>
