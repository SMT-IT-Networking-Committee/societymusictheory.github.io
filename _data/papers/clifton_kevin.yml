title: "Intertextuality and Evolution of Angelo Badalamenti’s “<i>Twin Peaks</i> Theme”"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Drawing from critical work done by Michael Klein on musical
  intertextuality, my presentation considers the origins of Angelo Badalamenti’s
  instrumental “<i>Twin Peaks</i> Theme” employed in the serial drama, <i>Twin
  Peaks</i> (1990–2017). Essentially, the “<i>Twin Peaks</i> Theme” is a
  dramatic reworking of Badalamenti’s popular song, “Falling” (sung by Julee
  Cruise, featured on her critically acclaimed album, <i>Floating into the
  Night</i> [1989]). The iconic television theme music can be read as a second
  musical text within the <i>Twin Peaks</i> universe: in this case, a mysterious
  song without words. My reading considers both of Badalamenti’s musical
  texts—the original popular song and the television theme music—and draws from
  an understanding of the original to consider how meaning is generated within
  the televisual milieu. In the second half of my presentation, I examine the
  audiovisual contract (after Michel Chion’s work in film-music studies) between
  the visuals and the music during the opening title credits. Specifically, I
  discuss how the title credits evolve throughout the series. Influenced by
  Scott Murphy’s work on audiovisual foreshadowing in Alfred Hitchcock’s films,
  my reading takes into account David Lynch’s stunning visual images, which
  feature thematic doubles pertinent to the <i>Twin Peaks</i> mythology (e.g.,
  nature versus civilization, as well as the natural world versus the
  supernatural world). My presentation investigates how Badalamenti’s music not
  only helps set the tone for each week’s episode, but a more in-depth
  investigation of the music itself reveals correspondences as a type of design
  as semiosis that feature various types of expressive doubles, a sonic mirror
  of the literary/visual terrain of the surrealist series.</p>
