title: Specific Correlations Between Abilities in Mathematics and Music Theory

abstract: |
    <p>Music theory teachers often observe that students who report great
    difficulty learning mathematics also find music theory especially challenging.
    This is not surprising: positive correlations between mathematical and musical
    abilities have been widely documented, and such connections have been asserted
    at least since the time of the Ancient Greeks. However, most research compares
    musicians with non-musicians, and musical performance (not music theory) is
    typically emphasized. Our pair of studies includes only trained musicians and
    specifically examines their success in music theory courses.</p>

    <p>We begin with an examination of correlations between student
    performance in music theory, mathematics, and English. This statistical
    study demonstrates a particularly strong relationship between math and
    music theory, and it distinguishes this correlation from general
    intelligence or academic aptitude. Our follow-up study investigates the
    precise nature of this math/music link, which previous research suggests
    is likely not causal but instead stems from etiological factors that
    contribute to success in both fields. Rather than relying solely on broad
    measures such as standardized exams, we assessed potential shared
    cognitive processing factors (e.g., spatial reasoning) and affective
    factors (e.g., anxiety), including basic numeracy, spatial skills, pattern
    recognition, and anxiety and confidence. We observed numerous positive
    correlations between mathematical/spatial skills and music theory
    performance. There were also significant positive correlations between
    confidence in both fields and performance in music theory classes, and
    corresponding negative correlations between anxiety in both fields and
    performance in music theory classes. We believe our results clarify some
    components of the oft-cited connection between mathematics and music.</p>
