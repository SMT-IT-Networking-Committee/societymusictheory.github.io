        <p>Ethan Edl is a PhD candidate in Music Theory at Yale University. His dissertation, titled "Leoš Janáček and the Aesthetics of Attention," proposes fresh analytic perspectives on Janáček's music by contextualizing the composer's music and thought within early 20th-century discourses of attention, psychoacoustics, and the phenomenology of time.</p>

    <p>Leoš Janáček frequently wrote for the viola d’amore, yet his music demonstrates a dubious understanding of the instrument’s unique affordances. What maintained the composer’s fixation on this archaic instrument, since none of Janáček’s works were performed with a viola d’amore in his lifetime? While existing scholarship generally begins (and ends) with the instrument’s name and the imagery it evokes, I explore some more tangible sources that might shed light on Janáček’s use of the viola d’amore, specifically the organ stop of the same name, and the suggestive correlations between the instrument’s construction and the composer’s idiosyncratic theories of harmony. Close readings of several musical examples reveal a consistent cluster of sonic effects which amplify or exaggerate certain aspects of the instrument, even as the viola d’amore part is paradoxically ill-suited for performance on the instrument itself. Recent scholarship has trained a critical lens on how instrumental technics inform compositional practice (De Souza 2017). As a case study, Janáček’s viola d’amore motivates an inquiry into the many forms of knowledge that might structure an encounter with an instrument one does <em>not</em> play. To address the gap between the “viola d’amore” in the composer’s scores and the viola d’amore as a sounding instrument, I propose thinking of Janáček’s viola d’amore as a qualified kind of <em>virtual</em> instrument, in the literal sense of emphasizing certain virtues of the instrument. This formulation invites us to attend to the <em>gaps</em> in knowledge and productive (mis)readings made possible by naïve encounters with musical instruments.</p>
