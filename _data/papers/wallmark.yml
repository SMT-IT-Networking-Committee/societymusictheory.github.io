title: "Timbre Semantics in Orchestration: A Corpus-Linguistic Study"
handout: ''
abstract: |
  <p>Timbral qualities of orchestral instruments are commonly described using a
  conventional lexicon of adjectives (e.g., <i>brilliant</i>, <i>nasal</i>,
  <i>rich</i>), but the semantic norms of this spoken and written discourse
  remain poorly understood. Books on orchestration and instrumentation provide a
  valuable source of natural language used to describe qualities of instrumental
  sound. Using methods from corpus linguistics, in this paper I explore the
  conventions of timbre description through a text analysis of a representative
  corpus of orchestration treatises published between 1844 and 2009. I ask three
  main questions: (1) What words are most common? (2) Are descriptive
  conventions reliably different from one instrument to the next? (3) What does
  this lexicon reveal about timbre more generally? </p>
  <p>The corpus consists of over 800 unique descriptive words. Most of these
  terms occur only a few times, with approximately half of all descriptions
  consisting of only fifty words. Furthermore, lexical diversity (novelty of
  word choice) is negatively correlated with year of publication, suggesting a
  pronounced historical trend in semantic practices. Terms can be classified
  into seven underlying conceptual categories—(1) affect, (2) matter, (3)
  cross-modal correspondence, (4) mimesis, (5) action, (6) acoustics, and (7)
  onomatopoeia—which are statistically significantly associated with individual
  instruments. This suggests that timbre description is more systematic and
  consistent than typically maintained. I interpret these novel results through
  the lens of conceptual metaphor theory and close with a brief discussion of
  implications for the broader music-theoretical and perceptual understanding of
  the cognitive semantic space of timbre. </p>
