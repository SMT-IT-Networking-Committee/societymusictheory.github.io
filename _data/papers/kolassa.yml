abstract: |
  <p>In 1972 British auteur Ken Russell directed <i>The Devils </i>, a
  scandalously shocking historical horror drama eclipsed, ultimately, by its
  struggle against censorship. <i>The Devils’</i> reception history has been
  much storied and only in recent years has <i>The Devils</i> experienced
  something of a critical revival: its cinematic innovations duly acknowledged
  over thirty years after its original release. Much has been said now of its
  striking visuals too, but a landmark musical collaboration, central to the
  film’s jarring discontinuities, has gone largely unexamined. </p>
  <p>The Devils features a sonically disturbing score composed by Peter Maxwell
  Davies alongside diegetic “period-appropriate” music from David Munrow and The
  Early Music Consort of London. This hybrid soundworld of both old and new
  mixes, furthermore, with a modernistic set design of a young Derek Jarman and
  the frenetic new-age cinematic expressionism of Russell himself. Though
  ostensibly historical, the film’s disruptive atemporal style is elevated
  through an art of stylized anachronism. This collaboration mirrors, in
  numerous ways, Davies’ opera <i>Taverner</i>, premiered a year earlier in
  1971, not least because it featured Munrow and his Consort as an onstage
  ensemble playing period-inspired “authentistic” original music, but also
  because Russell was originally pegged to be its director. Similarly taboo in
  its depiction of politics and religion, it is not hard to imagine what
  <i>Taverner</i> might have been had Russell been involved. </p>
  <i>The Devils</i> represents a compelling instance intersecting historicist
  compositional interests and a challenging avant garde aesthetic, with the very
  public, even popular, context of mass collaborative cinematic spectacle. This
  paper, then, uses this case study to explore a host of broader questions: how
  can that film’s collaborations (and reception) be used to reflect,
  comparatively, on contemporary opera, and what can they tell us about the
  blurring of spheres both popular and “avant-garde”? How also, might early
  music and compositional medievalism in, say, the work of a composer like Peter
  Maxwell Davies be transformed in cinematic contexts? And what can such a
  project reveal about The Early Music Consort of London’s “authentistic”
  interpretive style as a site for creative engagement with the past? </p>
