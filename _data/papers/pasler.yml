  <p>Whereas scholars have examined recordings in Berlin’s Phonogramm-Archiv for
  what they reveal about musical origins (Rehding 2000) and human evolution (Ames
  2003), analogous French archives have largely eluded scholarly study. The
  recent revelation of Azoulay’s 600 recordings at the 1900 Paris Exhibition,
  preceding Hornbostel’s work in Berlin (Pasler 2014), and of recordings made at
  the 1931 Colonial Exhibition in Paris (Cordereix 2006) are only beginnings.
  Moreover, André Schaeffner’s forty dictaphone recordings in Africa (1931) and
  his subsequent work at the Musée de l’homme (Girard 2014) have overshadowed
  others’ important roles in making, conserving, and studying ethnographic
  recordings. At the Musée de la parole, the Sorbonne’s Phonetic Institute, and
  the Musée Guimet, desire emerged for a global “sound geography.” </p>
  <p>Beginning in 1911, the Archives de la parole sought to assemble a “National
  Sound Atlas” of French dialects. A “sound museum” in 1928, it was integrated
  into Hubert Pernot’s Phonetic Institute. From 1928–30, Pernot sent staff to
  Eastern Europe and Greece where they made 674 recordings of folk traditions.
  Philippe Stern, curator at Trocadero’s Ethnographic Museum and the Musée
  Guimet, worked with Pernot to record, transcribe, and study “oriental, exotic,
  and distant music” from throughout the world. In 1927 they began a “musical
  library” of transcriptions from Brazil to India (1930–37). During the 1931
  Colonial Exhibition, Stern and Mady Humbert-Lavergne made 184 recordings—the
  “first sound atlas of the songs, music, and dialects” of their colonized
  peoples. Roger Devigne, Pernot’s successor in 1932 and founder of the
  organization, “Folklore through recordings,” built on these efforts, organizing
  numerous recording missions abroad, as did the National Phonothèque, created in
  1938.</p>
  <p>This paper, based on Stern’s archives, focuses on how he and female
  assistants, Humbert-Lavergne and Jeanne Herscher-Clement, assembled, analyzed,
  and used this “Atlas.” It scrutinizes their methodology for making,
  transcribing, annotating, and studying field recordings, their record reviews
  in the press, and the inclusion of recordings in their public lectures
  (1932–34) and scholarly articles in <i>Zeitschrift für Vergleichende
  Musikwissenschaft</i> (1933–34). Through genres, scales, rhythms, and timbres,
  these “echos of races and nations” created a topography enabling “auditory
  journeys” across the globe. </p>
