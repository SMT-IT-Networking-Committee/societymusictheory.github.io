abstract: |
  <p>The storytellers and teachers of the Gullah (or Geechee) nation share a
  rich intelligence that is not always represented with the complexity it
  deserves. While their culture and language is often dismissed as facile,
  DuBose Heyward found the Gullah culture of Charleston, South Carolina, vibrant
  and inspiring. His writings, including the 1925 novel <i>Porgy</i>, introduced
  this community to the world, and are now recognized as premier examples of
  Southern literature. The language is mesmerizing—a collection of dialects that
  have been fused into one English creole representation by popular culture.
  </p>
  <p>This project focuses on how the Gullah language is presented in George
  Gershwin’s <i>Porgy and Bess </i>(1935). Long considered one of the great
  American operas, it presents problems in terms of representation. <i>The
  Gullah</i> language in the libretto is, in truth, an approximation, based on
  Heyward’s youthful experience with the community, his own Southern dialect,
  and the proper English in which he wrote. Further, the way in which Gershwin
  set the text departs from the cadences of the original language, which relies
  on African traditions instead of American standards. Over time, as the work
  moved from Heyward’s novel, to the theatrical version by his wife, Dorothy
  Heyward, and the opera collaboration with the Gershwins, the language shifted
  toward what we now call Ebonics rather than a true Gullah representation; this
  encourages singers to play the characters as unlearned stereotypes. Drawing
  from the work of Virginia Geraty on the Gullah language, and employing Joan
  Wall’s IPA system for singers, this project generates performance options by
  which singers and directors can better represent the Gullah nation, and in
  turn produce an opera that depicts the complexity and growth of the characters
  on stage.</p>
