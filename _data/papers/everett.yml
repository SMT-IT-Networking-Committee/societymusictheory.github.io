abstract: |
    <p>Raymond Monelle traces the earliest example of the <i>pianto</i> motif
    as a signifier of suffering and sorrow to Giaches de Wert’s “Crudele
    acerba inesorabil morte.” Purcell’s <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> cements its
    dramatic and expressive function within the lament genre. However, Danuta
    Mirka argues for the pianto’s provisional topical status in the
    eighteenth-century musical discourse by showing how it is subsumed within
    the <i>Empfindsamkeit</i> topic. In nineteenth-century instrumental music,
    the motif becomes further unmoored from its earlier dramatic contexts as
    it turns into a ubiquitous expressive agent of Romantic yearning. Drawing
    on Hatten’s criteria for analyzing topics (2014), one may say that the
    motif loses its markedness within a topical field saturated by
    chromaticism.</p>

    <p>This paper analyzes the pianto’s role in contemporary operas and
    explores its intertextual scope and markedness as a topical signifier in
    reviving dramatic and expressive connotations of past operatic conventions.
    Drawing from a corpus study of dramatic and instrumental works composed
    between 1972-2005, I identify two types of pianto as topical signifier: a
    descending figure accompanied by a lament bass (Type A) and alternating upward
    and downward figures (appoggiaturas) over a static or walking bass (Type B).
    The formal and expressive functions of these types will be illustrated through
    an analysis of excerpts from Thomas Adès’s <i>The Tempest</i> (2002), John
    Adams’s <i>The Death of Klinghoffer</i> (1991) and <i>Doctor Atomic</i>
    (2005), and Kaija Saariaho’s <i>Adriana Mater</i> (2005). The pianto’s iconic
    reference to “weeping” is replaced by its broader symbolic function in shaping
    the narrative trajectory of each opera.</p>
