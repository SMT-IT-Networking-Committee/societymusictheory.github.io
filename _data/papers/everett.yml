abstract: |
  <p>In Walter Benjamin’s late writing on Baudelaire, allegory arises through an
  intuitive apprehension of the world and an inner experience that is
  fragmentary and enigmatic, characterized further by abrupt discontinuity and
  change of referentiality. Taking cues from Benjamin, this paper focuses on
  sonic moments that take a sharp allegorical turn in Thomas Adès’s <i>The
  Exterminating Angel</i> (2015). In adapting Luis Buñuel’s 1962 film <i>El
  ángel exterminador</i> for opera, Tom Cairns’s libretto retains the
  surrealistic fabula of the film narrative, while Adès’s music mocks the
  impropriety of high-class elites through the distortion of musical topics,
  time, and place.</p>
  <p>The fractured temporality of the opera structures the narrative in
  distinctive ways. Adès creates a caesura in time, marking off the
  chronological passing of time (i.e., striking of church bells) from the
  surrealistic ruptures and cyclical repetition of events that signify an
  otherworldly presence. The initial greeting of guests (“Enchanted”
  passacaglia) repeats for no apparent reason and then grows into a terrifying
  “march” featuring the Ondes Martenot and percussion at the end of Act I. In
  the subsequent scenes, Adès satirizes the hapless elites through fragmented
  and discontinuous allusions to the Viennese waltz and marks their descent into
  madness and savagery through engagement with familiar conventions (e.g.,
  Ragôut aria, “Panic” fugue, Berceuse, Witches trio). Exact reenactment of
  events from the dinner party eventually releases the characters from the spell
  and they are joined by their families outside the mansion. In the concluding
  scene, however, the static repetition of the Requiem chant shadowed by the
  Ondes Martenot suggests that escape is but an illusion for all involved. The
  Ondes Martenot’s uncanny presence as the voice of the Exterminating Angel
  leads us to wrestle with the opera’s allegorical significance at several
  registers: is it a commentary on the oppression of the Franco regime or a
  surrealistic fantasy that plays on one’s fear of entrapment? In concluding, I
  will explore the intersection between this opera and others in constructing a
  broader framework for relating allegory with fractured temporality in
  contemporary operas.</p>
