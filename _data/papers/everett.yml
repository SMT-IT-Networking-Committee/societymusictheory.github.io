abstract: |
    <p>In this presentation, I address the need to expand the musical
    repertory for analysis beyond the Western canon, as well as to develop
    intercultural strategies for analysis that reflect the multicultural
    subject positions of composers, performers, and theorists. In my area of
    specialization, discourses on exoticism, transculturation, Orientalism,
    and globalization have provided a framework for examining music composed
    by postwar composers of East Asian heritage, such as Chou Wen-chung, Toru
    Takemitsu, Tan Dun, Chen Yi, Unsuk Chin, and others. However, scholarly
    writings and reception of this music have tended to perpetuate the
    East-West binary by reinforcing musical stereotypes and familiar labels.
    Within music theory, this repertory has been assimilated into the canon
    and legitimized through application of post-tonal and other formalized
    models of analysis.  Prompted by developments in gender, semiotic, and
    disability studies, I explore analytical approaches that counterframe the
    binarism by privileging culture-specific modes of attending to musical
    gestures and expressive meanings, as exemplified in recent publications by
    Nancy Yunhwa Rao, Shyhji Pan-Chew, Eric Lai, and Christian Utz, among
    others.</p>
