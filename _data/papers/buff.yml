abstract: |
    <p>Ursula Günther originally invented the neologism <i>ars subtilior</i>
    in order to identify a style of highly mannered music from the late 14th
    century, but more recently it<i> </i>has become a wholesale description
    for all music of the era, ignoring geography, notation, genre, or style.
    By reexamining the origin of the phrase—not Günther’s <i>ars
    subtilior</i>,<i> </i>but instead the <i>ars magis subtiliter—</i>in the
    prologue to the treatise <i>Tractatus figurarum</i>, one can see that a
    key feature of the style is the use of a variety of rhythmic elements that
    override the reigning tempus of the motet. It is also notable that the
    lower voices are rhythmically active and the harmonic rhythm moves
    significantly faster than earlier motets. The notation of these works is
    not overtly complex, leaving subtle shifts of mensuration and meter in the
    hands of the performers, who in turn weave their texts and rhythms betwixt
    and between each other.</p>

    <p>In this paper, I revisit the concept of the <i>ars magis subtiliter</i>
    by considering this style within the context of the works that the
    <i>Tractaus </i>uses as musical examples—the anonymous motet <i>Apta caro
    – Flos virginum</i>, and two motets that are described in the treatise as
    the “grosso modo,” Vitry’s <i>Quoniam – Tribum que </i>and <i>Rex Karole
    </i>– <i>Leticie pacis</i>. Through careful analysis of both the notation
    and aural landscape of these works, I conclude that this style is not only
    created through musical notation and mensural complexity, but is also
    something that, as the theorist describes it, is subtler.</p>
