abstract: |
  <p>Conventional wisdom credits Rudolf Bing with the desegregation of the
  Metropolitan Opera, characterizing him as a benevolent liberal whose racially
  tolerant attitudes prompted the long-overdue hiring of the institution’s first
  African American performers, including dancer Janet Collins in 1951 and
  contralto Marian Anderson in 1955. In this paper, I argue that this narrative
  is misleading: it obscures the role of black activists who fought to
  desegregate the Met, overstates white male administrators’ investments in
  racial justice, and, ultimately, reinscribes the art form’s longstanding
  aesthetic and institutional commitments to racial essentialism and white
  supremacy. </p>
  <p>Archival evidence, particularly that which appears in the black press,
  illuminates sustained, well-organized efforts by black activists, especially
  black women, to desegregate the Met. Beginning in the 1940s, the singer Muriel
  Rahn spearheaded what she called a “campaign” to break the color line at the
  opera house. Rahn was joined by an array of African American performers and
  journalists who persuasively connected this effort to other antiracist
  struggles amid the Cold War and the long civil rights movement, but race and
  gender were obstacles to the efficacy of their attempts. I also demonstrate,
  via a close reading of Bing’s statements regarding desegregation, that his
  liberal commitment to racial tolerance was diluted by white supremacist ideas
  about the nature of opera. Just days before Anderson’s debut, Bing made clear
  that he still considered racialized casting a nonnegotiable precondition for
  black singers, and he did not consider structural changes beyond the hiring of
  exceptionally talented individuals. </p>
  <p>These revisions to the dominant historical narrative about the
  desegregation of the nation’s most iconic opera house raise a still-urgent
  question: what are the limits of a desegregationist paradigm as a solution to
  opera’s racial inequities? I argue that a singular focus on desegregation,
  while well-intentioned and seemingly progressive, actually relies upon a
  continued capitulation to the art form’s existing racial logics. In doing so,
  it narrows the critical discourse around the look and sound of racial justice,
  foreclosing opportunities for more capacious changes. </p>
