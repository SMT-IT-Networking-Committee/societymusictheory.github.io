title: "The Pamela Paradox; Or, How Arbitrary Signs Evoke Sensations in Haydn’s Op. 77 No. 2"

abstract: |
  <p>Sensation is an immediate form of knowledge, communicated and evoked by
  <i>natural signs</i>, according to eighteenth-century writers like Condillac.
  In contrast, <i>arbitrary signs</i>, (or artificial signs), require knowledge
  of an interpretive code, useful for discourse but not immediate sensation.
  Contemporary European aesthetics valued music for its use of natural signs to
  arouse the senses, improving the moral virtue of an audience. In practice,
  however, arbitrary musical signs are extremely effective at evoking
  sensations, provided that a piece does not become marked as an artifice of
  feeling. Thus, composers like Joseph Haydn negotiated an aesthetic dilemma by
  using arbitrary signs to arouse the senses, which I call the <i>Pamela
  Paradox</i>. </p>
  <p>This paper examines how the Pamela Paradox informs Haydn’s compositional
  choices for expressing and evoking feelings during a period that purportedly
  disparaged arbitrary signs, drawing upon Diderot’s essay, <i>The Paradox of
  the Actor</i>, and the Pamela-Anti-Pamela debates surrounding Richardson’s
  sentimental novel, <i>Pamela</i>. I then turn much-needed attention to the
  practical application of theories of signification in contemporary music.
  Haydn was intimately familiar with arbitrary signs of emotional expression,
  having deployed them in his own sentimental opera <i>La vera costanza</i>. The
  slow movement of Haydn’s op. 77, no. 2 is an example of how natural
  devices—such as varied repetition—work alongside conventionalized expressive
  figures—such as sighs, gasps, and pauses found in Piccinni’s sentimental
  opera, <i>La buona figliuola</i>—in a way that successfully negotiates the
  Pamela Paradox. In comparison, the slow movements of Haydn’s op. 33, no. 3 and
  op. 76, no. 4 contain more frequent uses of arbitrary signs, often thematizing
  them in order to evoke more dramatic sensations in an audience. </p>
  <p>For Condillac, op. 77 would have more power to improve the moral virtue of
  listeners; however, opp. 33 and 76 are more evocative of emotional expression,
  and I would suggest, more capable of arousing sensations through arbitrary
  signs. The eighteenth-century debate over natural and arbitrary signs can thus
  inform an understanding of the expressive language in contemporary
  instrumental music. Additionally, it may suggest refinement of our own modern
  theoretical tools, such as topic theory.</p>
