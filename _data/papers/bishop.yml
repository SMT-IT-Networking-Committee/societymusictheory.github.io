  <p>Discussions of the role played by the music of J. S. Bach in Soviet
  <i>auteur</i> Andrei Tarkovsky’s films have generally focused on Bach as
  symbolically evoking a venerable tradition of Old Masters and spiritual
  profundity, cultivating a view of Tarkovsky as a filmmaker with a highly
  personal, even mystical sensibility who was forced to navigate with difficulty
  the demands of socialist realism. Despite their explanatory value with regards
  to biography and culture, however, such discussions open little conceptual
  space for detailed readings of the extraordinary flow of audiovisual
  experiences that Tarkovsky’s films so richly provide. This paper suggests,
  developing recent work on audiovisuality and synchronization (such as John
  Richardson’s “audiovisual surreal” and K. J. Donnelly’s “occult aesthetics”)
  that a more useful metaphor for Tarkovsksy’s use of Bach and for our experience
  of these moments might instead be found in the idea of divination, or the
  evoking of non-human agency in a gesture that is both interpretive and
  creative. Like casting lots, laying cards, or feeling your way around a dowsing
  rod, these complex moments obliquely position a pre-existing musical text
  alongside visual signs of transcendence, generating inherently unpredictable
  emergent meanings. This divinatory aesthetic comes into particular focus in
  Tarkovsky’s two science fiction films, <i>Solaris</i> (1972) and <i>Stalker</i>
  (1979). Whereas <i>Solaris</i> makes extended use of a chorale prelude from
  <i>Das Orgelbüchlein</i> (BWV 639), <i>Stalker</i> ironically employs only a
  single fragment of the aria “Erbarme dich, mein Gott” (from BWV 244), whistled
  by a character. And yet this solitary reference is framed within a film that is
  in many ways about divination as a means of opening the self to the reality of
  the numinous. In addition to opening a field of conceptual-sensual audiovisual
  thinking, I will argue that the de-centered “off-meanings” of divinatory work
  also provide a useful horizon for exploring the interconnection of Bach’s music
  and composer Eduard Artemiev’s electro-acoustic soundscapes.</p>
