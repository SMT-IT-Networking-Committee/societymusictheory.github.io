abstract: |
  <p>On 8 February 1935 the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> ran an
  article that would turn the world of music criticism on its head. Telegramming
  from Europe between concert appearances, the sixty-year-old virtuoso violinist
  and composer Fritz Kreisler confessed that fourteen pieces he previously
  claimed to have adapted from antique seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
  manuscripts were, as he put it, “in every detail my original compositions.”
  The revelation led to a heated debate between Kreisler and the London
  <i>Sunday Times</i>’s music critic Ernest Newman, who claimed that the
  forgeries only appeared to have “fooled the experts” because “a vast amount of
  seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music was merely the exploitation of
  formulae.”</p>
  <p>This analytical paper explores the aesthetic stakes of the Newman-Kreisler
  debate by turning to the forgeries themselves. Kreisler’s compositions are
  contextualized with respect to the “formulae” of late-nineteenth-century
  schemata-based pedagogy, as well as the broader contemporary culture of what
  Bruce Haynes (2007) has called “period composition.” Close reading of the
  forged “Vivaldi” violin concerto—whose “harmonic changes” Kreisler later
  described as “strictly Schubertian and Berliozian”—reveals a striking
  adaptation of eighteenth-century sequential models to the symmetrical harmonic
  idioms of the violinist’s contemporaries. Yet pre-1935 critics often applauded
  the authenticity of Kreisler’s “rediscoveries” precisely because of those
  faux-Baroque features that strike us as egregiously anachronistic today. In
  re-examining Kreisler’s works and the discourse that surrounded them, I make
  the case that musical forgeries encode historical habits of composing and
  listening that are worthy of serious analytical inquiry.</p>
