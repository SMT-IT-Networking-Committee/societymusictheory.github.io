abstract: |
  <p>One of the most important scales in traditional Japanese music, commonly
  known as the <i>miyakobushi</i>, places its second scale degree only a
  semitone above its final. This characteristic naturally invites comparisons to
  the Phrygian mode in the West, though in this paper I demonstrate that the
  Phrygian mode as practiced by medieval and Renaissance Europeans placed much
  less emphasis on the final than do Japanese folk melodies in the
  miyakobushi—this aversion goes at least as far back as the earliest notated
  chants despite the early enshrinement of the <i>deuterus</i> mode.</p>
  <p>I then explore how Japanese musicians reacted to the Western incursions of
  the mid-nineteenth century, illustrating how such contrasting attitudes
  towards Phrygian-type finals could blend in new compositions and arrangements.
  Such pieces, viewable as the result of efforts to reconcile two arguably
  irreconcilable musical systems, suggest that humanity’s adaptability and urge
  to make music easily overrides such deep contradictions in musical grammar,
  creating new styles from their mixture with little strain wherever a social
  need is felt.</p>
  <p>I use the <i>enka</i> genre as my principal example of such a style, which
  frequently fits miyakobushi-derived vocal material to instrumental parts in
  the Western tonal minor mode—it is a style that has been called an “invented
  tradition” (Yano 2002, 41), and it is one in which the seams are still easily
  observable to a music analyst. Nevertheless, despite the clarity of the seams
  that testify to the genre’s hybrid origins, it continues to serve as a symbol
  of “the heart/soul of [the] Japanese [people]” (Yano 2002, 4).</p>
