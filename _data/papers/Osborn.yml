abstract: | 
    <p>Ideas now fifty years old surrounding the “double-tonic complex” (Bailey 1969) and its kindred offshoots have received considerable attention in the past decade from popular music scholars (Capuzzo 2009, Schultz 2012, Rusch 2013, Ferrandino 2017, de Clercq 2019, Nobile 2020). Most of these contributions attempt to make sense of popular music’s propensity for pairing two relative keys whose roots lie a minor third apart. When these pairings share the same seven pitch classes (ABCDEFG, representing both A Aeolian and C major), I have previously argued that they should be considered “major until proven otherwise” (Osborn 2017, 150).  </p>
    <p>In this paper I shed light on a tonal palette heard in recent multimedia scores (especially television dramas) that sounds a caveat to my “major until proven otherwise” theorem. These harmonic structures, which I dub <u>dual leading-tone loops</u> (DLTL), employ two <em>different</em> leading tones, one for the relative major and one for the relative minor. In presenting an eight-pitch-class palette (ABCDEFGGě) over a looping progression usually lasting just four chords, DLTLs exert a strong tonal pull toward both C major and A minor in short succession.</p>
    <p>This indeterminate tonality, embracing multiple keys without foreclosing on either, provides the perfect accompaniment for recent multimedia works in which characters embody seemingly disparate ideas simultaneously. I demonstrate these emotionally multivalent DLTLs through the analysis of several multimedia works including <em>Euphoria, A Handmaid’s Tale</em>, <em>Succession, The Leftovers,</em> and the hit Broadway musical <em>Hamilton.</em></p>
