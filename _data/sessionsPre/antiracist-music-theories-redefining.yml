abstract: | 
    <p>Music theorists are increasingly questioning the “white racial frame” of our field (Ewell 2020). New pedagogical resources have been created to decenter the whiteness of music theory classrooms, and there is renewed scholarly interest in the affordances of cross-cultural analysis and the works of under-studied theorists of color. More can be done, however, to move the field toward an antiracist praxis. This panel evaluates the legacy of music theory's historical involvement in racist and imperialist projects and opens to field to more diverse theoretical and disciplinary perspectives, ultimately reimagining music theory’s position within discourses of power and authority.</p> <p> This session brings together an interdisciplinary group of ten scholars to deliver ten-minute lightning talks. These talks represent works in progress for the upcoming edited volume, Key Terms in Music Theory for Antiracist Scholars. Each speaker has chosen a single key term as the focus of their talk. Some terms are drawn from traditional discourses in music theory, while others represent conceptual and practitioner-based innovations that broaden the field’s epistemological scope. In focusing this session around terminology, we aim to denaturalize the field's basic assumptions about music and analysis while still validating music theory’s traditional focus on musical detail. Our session’s speakers imagine an antiracist future for our discipline in which theorists critically examine the constructions of race, human, and world produced by our analytical terminologies. The session is divided into two parts separated by a twenty-minute break. Each part will feature five papers followed by thirty minutes of discussion.</p>
