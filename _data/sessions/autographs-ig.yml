    <p>The Autographs and Archival Documents Interest group is pleased to host a presentation by Jill Vuchetich, head of the Archives and Libraries at the Walker Art Center, an institution with a long history as a leading advocate for art and music in our (virtual) host cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. With an active Performing Arts department since 1970, the Walker has commissioned and hosted performances by musicians like Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, David Byrne, and many others. The Walker maintains an extensive archive, with many holdings relating to this long history of musical activity. This presentation will focus on the resources of these collections and scholarly projects that have involved these important holdings.</p>
    <p>After the presentation we will have time for discussion and a brief business meeting. We hope to address some of the current challenges to archival research, what future activities our Interest Group should plan in light of this, and to begin a discussion to formulate governing documents for our group.</p>
