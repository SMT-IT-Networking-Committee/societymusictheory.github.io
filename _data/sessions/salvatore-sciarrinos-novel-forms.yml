    <p>Writing in 2001, David Osmond-Smith called Salvatore Sciarrino “one of the most distinctive (and widely imitated) voices of his generation.” Sciarrino’s prodigious output in the nearly two decades since has cemented his reputation as one of the new century’s foremost composers. Scholars have been intrigued by the music’s obsessive repetitions, carefully crafted <em>Gestalten,</em> and naturalistic approach to musical sounds, in addition to his well-documented compositional philosophy (Sciarrino 1998, 2001, 2004). This alternative-format session aims to promote music-theoretical engagement with Sciarrino’s work and to encourage dialogue between European and North American discourses.</p>
    <p>The three papers in this session share a thematic focus on form, temporality, and process. Christian Utz offers a corpus study of Sciarrino’s unusual beginnings and endings, using perception-sensitive analytical methods (Deliège 2001; Utz 2016) to show how Sciarrino’s temporal strategies combine linear and nonlinear aspects and reclaim holistic elements of the listening experience. Antares Boyle turns a microscope on Sciarrino’s multivalent temporalities through analysis of a single piece, the 1999 piano concerto <em>Recitativo oscuro</em>. Mingyue Li interrogates Sciarrino’s concept of “organic music” itself (Sciarrino 2013). With a methodology grounded in Clarke’s (2005) ecological approach to musical listening, she argues that Sciarrino’s musical processes, conceived in synthetic rather than analytic terms, are akin to natural phenomena.</p>
