abstract: |
    <p>Music theory pedagogy has recently undergone a reckoning, perhaps best exemplified in Campbell et al. 2014 and Duker et al. 2015. Publications such as <em>Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy</em> and the <em>Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy</em> have championed critical pedagogy and, importantly, have presented this work in open-access formats to ensure the latest scholarship is available to all. SMT’s 2019 plenary session “Reframing Music Theory” was, for many of us, a watershed moment, galvanizing the need to create a more diverse, equitable, and accessible field for our colleagues and students. Despite this enthusiasm, relatively few teachers are prepared to discard their textbooks. Textbooks released by for-profit publishers are rigidly structured, and the field’s dependence on them hinders the creation of a more flexible, inclusive, and accessible curriculum. There are additional limitations with traditional textbooks that impede learning in theory classrooms: (1) they are expensive—a potential barrier for lower-income students and non-college teachers without a large textbook budget; (2) they lack the advantages of an open-access digital format, such as immense customizability or potential for computational pedagogical approaches.</p>
    <p>Our alternative-format special session promotes open educational resources (OER) as the cornerstone for building a more flexible, inclusive, and accessible music theory classroom. Through five lightning talks, we demonstrate how we use one particular OER—the new, second edition of <em>Open Music Theory</em> (hereafter <em>OMT2</em>)—in our effort to dismantle the barriers described above.</p>
