    <p>This year&rsquo;s annual gathering will continue the theme of psychoanalysis as method vs. interpretive program. Amy Bauer will share excerpts from her essay, &ldquo;The Sublime Object of Music Analysis,&rdquo; which casts a psychoanalytic gaze over several analyses of Schubert&rsquo;s setting of Heine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der Doppelg&auml;nger.&rdquo; Participants are encouraged to engage these short,&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zQzPrxZcK3BJBTNqVO0hao1x15vuUJZG?usp=sharing">suggested readings</a>&nbsp;and to bring their questions to our discussion. A brief business meeting will follow.</p>
