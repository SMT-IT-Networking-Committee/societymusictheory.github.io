abstract: |
    <p>The musical language shared among Black and white American vernacular musicians, sometimes referred to as the “common stock,” underwent profound transformations of musical style and meaning in the postwar era. Musicians explored new approaches to the common stock in response to dramatic changes in American society, including the continued migration of African Americans out of the South, so-called white flight to the suburbs, and heightened nationalism. Discourses surrounding common stock styles increasingly emphasized reductive narratives of American music genres as racially segregated, and as only vaguely attached to the musical styles and approaches of prewar society. While much scholarship has complicated such narratives, including work by Karl Hagstrom Miller and Christopher A. Waterman, the specific strategies of musicians engaging with common-stock sources from the 1950s through the 1970s warrants further exploration.</p>
    <p>The papers in this panel combine musical analysis and historical inquiry to examine the ways in which postwar country, rhythm-and-blues, and punk rock styles engaged with prewar common stock resources, including traditional blues patterns, orally transmitted fiddle tunes, gospel musical tropes, and chord sequences such as the passamezzo moderno. Our methodologies blend close musical readings, formal analysis, prototype modeling, and critical reception theory. Together these papers aim to reconsider the performance styles of postwar musicians within these markedly American genres as they refracted their changing social environments. They lengthen the historical range in which postwar American vernacular styles are considered, and widen the lens through which we view American music genres as sharing a single multifaceted and multiracial tradition.</p>
