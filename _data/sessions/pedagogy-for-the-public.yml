    <p>Long before the pandemic&rsquo;s rush to online teaching, social media content creators were doing useful work explaining musical ideas in ways that students and non-specialists could understand. In music history, Linda Shaver-Gleason's &ldquo;Not Another Music History Clich&eacute;!&rdquo; blog was well-received by specialists and non-specialists alike. In memory of her untimely passing, our session will focus on the pedagogy of outreach, bringing together a panel of content creators and public scholars in both disciplines. We seek to demonstrate how we can make musicology/theory more accessible, both to college students and to the public.</p>
    <p>The session will comprise two 75-minute panel discussions, each with four presenters. The first discussion will explore &ldquo;Media Methods,&rdquo; with presentations on the pedagogical aspects of podcasting, the critical evaluation of media claims, Instagram, and digital literacy. The second discussion will focus on &ldquo;Creating a Channel,&rdquo; with presentations on community engaged scholarship, &ldquo;explainer&rdquo; videos, establishing a YouTube presence, and creating music theory materials for a broad audience.</p>
