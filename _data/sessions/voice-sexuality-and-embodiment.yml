abstract: | 
    <p>The new Committee on LGBTQ+ Issues will host a 180-minute session at the 2021 Annual Meeting. Two hours will be devoted to presentations by guest speakers with response and discussion. The remaining hour will be for open discussion of issues in the professional lives of LGBTQ+ music theorists and music scholars.</p><p>Two outstanding scholars of Black worship experience will present on interactions of music, embodiment, and sexuality in Black worship contexts, especially Pentecostal. We will have a response from a music theorist who has done subtle work on love and embodiment in musical experience and a musicologist who has done detailed work on the analysis of vocal performance in relation to gender and sexuality.</p>
