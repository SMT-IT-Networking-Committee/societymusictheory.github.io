    <p> We're going to have discussions over Zoom with various breakout rooms discussing one of two topics: 1) moving labs and experimental research into a remote format (How have people done it? What are they doing? What's working and not working?), and 2) how to encourage diversity and diverse perspectives in music cognition research, specifically when it comes to experiments and the intersection of music cognition and music theory.</p>
