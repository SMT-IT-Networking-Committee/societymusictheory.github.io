    <p>This session offers analytic perspectives on musicals that blur and expand the traditional heterosexual paradigm, highlighting musical moments that are unexpected, unorthodox, and transformative. Three papers analyze ambiguous sexual subtexts: one paper discusses “hidden” references to sex, and two papers explore moments where a female character is ambivalent about conforming to the trappings of a heterosexual relationship. Three papers analyze musicals that foreground queer sexual relationships. One paper examines the different ways that sexual desire is depicted for gods and mortals in <em>Hadestown</em>. We will present a series of seven lightning talks. An overall organization by theoretical methodology (rather than by chronology, plot topics, or character themes) allows a rich network of cross-references between the seven papers to emerge. The papers feature a broad range of musicals that intersect and overlap with one another in compelling (and sometimes unexpected) ways: for example, three talks describe phrases in ways that derive from Caplin’s sentential taxonomy, three involve feminist and/or queer theory, and three discuss topics and stylistic interplay (several of the seven talks fall into multiple categories).</p>
