    <p>On the occasion of her 60th birthday, the special session aims to explore the music of the South Korean composer Unsuk Chin, one of the most exciting and significant composers of our time. In her self-described “cosmopolitan” musical style, critics have often pointed to the influence of Ligeti, Bartók, Stravinsky, Messiaen, and Xenakis, among others. In addition to common modern-classical compositional devices, she also incorporates non-Western musical materials such as the sheng (Chinese mouth organ) and rhythmic adaptation of Javanese gamelan. The resulting compositions prominently feature rhythmic vibrancy, microtonal and spectral harmonies, coloristic texture, timbral variety, and innovative forms. The session intends to position Chin’s compositions as objects of rigorous analytical investigation; the three papers therefore diversify the repertoire of twentieth and twenty-first-century music theory scholarship by focusing on this underexplored, non-Western woman composer.</p><p>The session engages with two overarching themes. First, it delves into Chin’s novel approach to canonic Western genres such as etude and concerto through creative treatment of rhythm, formal concepts, and instrumentation. This examination positions Chin’s music within the context of her contemporaries’ diverse compositional techniques in dealing with similar genres while highlighting her distinctive contribution. Second, it holds significance beyond analysis in a narrower sense by emphasizing the dynamic qualities shared among the works chosen for analysis. Each paper addresses Chin’s music as defying fixed, static formal frames: defining musical form as a process of consistent textural and timbral change; tapping into performance-perception oriented temporal analysis; and detailing the circulating energy that creates organically unfolding musical form.</p>
