    <p>What do we mean when we say an improvisation is based on something? The late music psychologist Jeff Pressing proposed the term “referent”—“an underlying formal scheme or guiding image specific to a given piece, used by the improviser to facilitate the generation and editing of improvised behavior on an intermediate time scale” (1984, 346)—to encompass the myriad musical and conceptual structures underlying an improvisation. While Pressing initially characterized the referent as one input among many in a model of improvisers’ cognitive processes, later scholars sought to retool the concept to address particularities of specific improvisatory styles as well as analytical perspectives. Notably, Michaelsen (2019) has discussed how referents act as interactional influences during improvisations, and Love (2017) recontextualized the term from the ecological perspective of “affordances.” These attempts at retooling suggest that a critical reflection on the concept of the referent is in order. Are there aspects of the original definition that have disappeared in today’s discourse? Does the instability of improvisation’s work-concept, as discussed by music ontologists (Alperson 2016; Brown 2011; Gracyk 1996; Kania 2011), weaken (or strengthen) the legitimacy of the referent? How might the concept of the referent be updated to reflect new improvisatory techniques and music-theoretical models that came after its inception?</p>
