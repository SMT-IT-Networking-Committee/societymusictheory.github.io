    <p>The SMT Jazz Interest Group will hold its twenty-sixth annual meeting at the 2020 conference. We invite all members interested in jazz analysis to attend. During the meeting, we will announce the winner of the 2020 Steve Larson Award for Jazz Scholarship. We will then have a discussion around the topic of how “music theory’s white racial frame,” to use Philip Ewell’s phrasing, has influenced the study of jazz music. The meeting will conclude by discussing topics for next year’s meeting as well as other business.</p>
