    <p>Without a radio hit, MTV exposure, or viral internet fame, the improvisational rock band Phish has remained one of the most vibrant, successful, and enigmatic forces in popular music for over twenty-five years. Phish regularly sells out arenas and amphitheaters across the country, stages immersive single-band festivals that draw upwards of 60,000 fans to remote locations, and in 2017, the band performed a 13-concert residency at Madison Square Garden without repeating a song. Phish's playfulness and virtuosic, exploratory improvisational style-no two concerts are the same-have earned them hundreds of thousands of devoted fans and inspired many jam bands and indie rock groups.</span></p>
    <p>Despite these accomplishments, there is a dearth of scholarship on the music of Phish, especially from within music disciplines. This is surprising given that fan analysis, what Grasso (2019) calls "amateur music theory," is an integral part of Phish fan identity. An examination of Phish's improvisational style and process is therefore long overdue, as it reveals an aesthetic and form that can serve as a framework for theorizing improvisation in rock music more broadly.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>This joint AMS/SMT ninety-minute session examines Phish's music from the perspectives of music theory, cultural theory, and fandom studies. The first paper (AMS) argues that a discursive practice of analyzing improvisation among Phish fans constitutes part of their identity construction. However, this public music theory discourse is seldom based on technical musical terms, instead relying on fan-generated, affective descriptors. The second paper (SMT) uses these fan descriptions as a point of departure for theorizing multiple typologies of improvisational practice in Phish's music, which serves as a model for rock improvisation more generally. The final paper (SMT) analyzes Phish's improvisational style using a single case study of a live performance, demonstrating how the band's establishment, then abandonment of a basic groove is a significant generator of dynamic changes in musical intensity that also serves as a highly valued aesthetic quality among fans. Taken together, these three papers reveal that Phish's music and their fanbase provide a unique locus of study at the intersection of music theory, popular culture, and (sub)cultural practice.</span></p>
