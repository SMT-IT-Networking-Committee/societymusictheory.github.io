    <h1>Welcome from SMT</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the first joint virtual conference for AMS and SMT! We pride ourselves in taking the challenges of the COVID era and creating a virtual conference that will exceed the traditional conference experience while minimizing our carbon footprint. We offer the most diverse program of presentations for any SMT conference yet, with the opportunity to view presentations in-depth before the conference, and to interact in real-time with the authors during a session. Similarly, we hope you will take advantage of the enlarged poster sessions &ndash; a highlight of last year&rsquo;s conference&mdash;in a format that allows you view materials at your leisure before interacting with the presenter.</p>
	<p>One of the recurring themes in the design of our program has been ﬂexibility: to view multiple sessions that would normally have been scheduled simultaneously; to register for AMS sessions, SMT sessions, or both; to take part in asynchronous Slack discussions after a session has ended.</p>
	<p>Of course, this splendid program wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the generous work of many volunteers and support from our donors. We especially thank the Program Committee, chaired by Danny Jenkins; the Networking Committee, chaired by Brian Moseley; and our Executive Director, Jennifer Diaz for overseeing every detail of the conference and formulating such creative solutions.</p>
	<p>A special welcome to undergraduate students. We hope you will find events that stimulate your interest in music theory. We also thank our AMS colleagues for their openness and collegiality during the many months of planning for this conference.</p>

    <h1>How does our conference work?</h2>

    <p>Presenters in our various sessions have created materials (videos, posters, papers, handouts, etc) that are available on this website.

    <p>Sessions and interest group meetings have both synchronous/verbal discussions and asynchronous/text-based discussions.</p>

    		<li>Synchronous discussions and meetings occur on Zoom occur at the date and time listed on each session or meeting page. Once you have found the session or meeting you'd like to join, click the blue Zoom button to join in at the listed session or meeting time.</li>
    		<li>Before, during, and following the synchronous discussion, each session and interest group will have opportunity for discussion on Slack. You can find these discussion channels linked on each session or meeting page.</li>
    	</ul>
