    <h1>Welcome from the SMT</h1>
	<p>Welcome to our second virtual conference for SMT! We’ve retained the successes of last year’s conference and drawn upon your feedback from the post-conference survey to make this conference even better. Sessions will now be in the format of interactive live presentations. These sessions will be recorded and archived so that you may view them after the conference until December 31<sup>st</sup>. Like last year’s conference there will be enlarged poster sessions followed by Q&amp;A and individual breakout rooms. Slack channels will be available for further discussion during and after the conference. Please meet the Board on Thursday, 7:00 PM.</p>
	<p>We again pride ourselves in meeting the challenges of the COVID era and creating an extensive and diverse program while minimizing our carbon footprint. Of course, this splendid program wouldn’t have been possible without the generous work of many volunteers and support from our donors. We especially thank the Program Committee, chaired by Frank Samarotto; the Networking Committee, chaired by Phil Duker; our President-Elect, Michael Buchler; and our Executive Director, Jennifer Diaz for overseeing every detail of the conference and formulating such creative solutions.</p>
	<p>And thanks to our sponsors: Indiana University Press (Annual Meeting sponsor), Rising Software (Plenary sponsor) and Artusi, Inc. (Free Undergraduate Admission Program sponsor).<br />
	<br />
	A special welcome to undergraduate students! We hope you will find events that stimulate your interest in music theory.</p>
	<p>Patricia Hall, President</p>
