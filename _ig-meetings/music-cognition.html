<p>Justin London (Carleton College) will give a short presentation on how to
build collaborations with existing labs at your institution and beyond. Then,
the meeting will move to a small groups discussion format, where people go to
a different small group based on their interest (e.g. interest in
computational labs, interest in behavioral psychology labs, etc.).</p>
