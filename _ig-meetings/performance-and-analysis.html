<p class="abs-title">Using Embodiment Schema to Help Student Performers Relate to
Their Theory Work</p>
<p class="abs-author">Bonnie McAlvin (CUNY Graduate Center)</p>

<p>This brief talk illustrates how embodiment schema (Lakoff and Johnson 1980)
can be used to engage performance students in their music theory work, by
bridging students’ analytical work to the development of their narrative
imagination and mastery of grouping and expression. An important function of
analysis is that of revealing potential groupings. In many cases, groupings
map readily onto embodiment image schema such as UP/DOWN, CONTAINER, and
BARRIER. We are able to empathize with motions UP, DOWN, IN and OUT, so
groupings which map onto these schema are in turn readily anthropomorphized.
An approach to a passage might ask whether a middleground reading moves UP or
DOWN, and what the anthropomorphized pitch-group hopes to achieve in moving
UP/DOWN? Contextualizing the slope is part of this work: is the
anthropomorphized pitch-group navigating a slippery cave, battling a current,
or wafting a hillside? As students master analytical tools, mappings can
become sophisticated. What awaits the pitch group at the end of the PATH: a
tonic chord or a betrayal? Which of the steps UP/DOWN are in the diatonic
CONTAINER, and which are chromatic? Of the scale degree steps, which are part
of the governing harmonic CONTAINER? How does each step relate to the various
metric CONTAINERS and how does this enliven the narrative? The talk suggests
some group activities that use embodiment schema mapping to prime students
toward higher engagement in the intricate analytical work of harmonic,
voice-leading, Schenkerian, and set class analysis.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Three Case Studies In Search of Holistic Performance
Research</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jonathan Dunsby (Eastman School of Music)</p>

<p>I offer three short case studies:</p>

<ol>
    <li>a critical aspect of microtiming studies, specifically Llorens’ recent
        article researching onset asynchrony in Brahms performance, with a minimum
        perceptibility threshold of 100 ms;</li>

    <li>Gould’s ‘prelude’ to Webern’s Op. 27i, which to my knowledge has not been
        studied theoretically before, despite the wealth of recent performance
        research on the Piano Variations; and</li>

    <li>another look at Schenker’s graphic analysis of Chopin’s Fourth Prelude and
        Schachter’s durational reduction, in light of actual ‘readings’ old and
        new (for example here, Pollini’s and Trifonov’s).</li>
</ol>

<p>I briefly air my position that what typically appears in
theoretically-informed performance studies is a disassembled practice, the
investigation of only those elements of a performance that can be measured,
assessed, or manipulated, always in danger of being called ivory-tower rather
than real-life. Equally, the concentration on surface analysis, on the results
of the application of what followers of Lewin call the ‘technology’ of music
theory, may be considered to have evaded a concrete engagement between
interpretive practice and musical meaning in its deepest, inclusive
senses.</p>

<p>In the first two case studies we see Kerman’s ‘positivism,’ through, first,
excusable, totalizing assertion of perceptual pertinence, and, secondly, the
understandable exclusion of obscure but intriguing creative evidence. The
second two cases show how an engagement with precompositional materials, or
structurally remote features of the ‘inner’ form, can be part of interpreters’
volitional agency and affect all parameters of the sounding score.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Paradox of Interpretation and the Resolved(?) Dualism</p>
<p class="abs-author">Wing Lau (University of Arkansas)</p>

<p>The paradox of interpretation, the belief that performance serves the work
and the composer but the performer’s subjective contribution is inevitable,
has a long history in performance discourse (Rosen 2002 and Cook 2013). The
attempt to reconcile such paradox, the notion “to play as if from the soul of
the composer” represents an early Romantic subjectivity (Hunter 2005), a
resolved dualism that still influences the classical music culture today.</p>

<p>In this paper, I suggest that the attempt to reconcile such paradox, the
resolved dualism, is paradoxical in and of itself. I illustrate discrepancies
between the recordings of Artur Schnabel, a pianist who strives to reach the
“same free spiritual height” as the composer, and his interpretative
rationales documented by his students in Wolff 1979. In addition to the
dissonance between his rationales and the interpretive choice documented in
his recordings, I demonstrate the dissonance between his rationales and his
perceived intention of the composer. I ask, can one be truly immersed in the
soul of another? Can we not argue that the composer’s supposed intention is
actually Schnabel’s own subjectivity masked behind authenticity, consciously
or not? As this paper shows, the performers’ subjectivity and their perceived
intention of the composer could be hard to distinguish, and that the resolved
dualism could be more apparent than real. Recognizing this paradox sharpens
our sensitivity towards performers with the authentic reputation and help us
better understand the epistemology of the faithful performance.</p>
