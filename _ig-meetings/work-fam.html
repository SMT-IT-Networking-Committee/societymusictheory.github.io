<p class="abs-title">“Super-Commuting: One Solution to the Two-Career Problem”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jenine Brown (Peabody Conservatory)</p>

<p>According to the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford
University, more than a third of academics are partnered with another academic
(<a
href="http://gender.stanford.edu/dual-career-research-report">http://gender.stanford.edu/dual-career-research-report</a>).
Indeed, my partner has an academic music career in Michigan, and I teach in
the theory department at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland.
Because the dual hire (both full-time, tenure-track) was not an option for us,
I have spent the last two academic years flying from DTW to BWI on Monday and
from BWI to DTW on Thursday.  My children were based in Michigan with my
partner throughout.  This presentation aims to share the costs of
“super-commuting” so that those considering such an arrangement can make a
more informed decision. Costs discussed will itemize air fare, lodging, and
transportation that I incurred. I also consider the more intangible costs: how
this may have affected how I was perceived at my institution, and the
emotional burdens on my children/partner while I was away at work. I will also
describe the benefits that I encountered. Finally, prior to the presentation,
I will survey similar couples that have taken on a similar “super-commuting”
arrangement, and I will share summarized findings.</p>


<p class="abs-title">“Choosing Adjunct Life”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Elizabeth Smith (Normal, IL)</p>

<p>A subset of adjuncts are academics who make a choice to be an adjunct.
Typically, this choice is motivated by a family-related need; raising a
family, spousal employment, caring for extended family members. Many positions
now exist as "permanent adjuncts" with budget crises offering little hope for
change to this now academic norm. This presentation not only offers adjuncts
(and potential adjuncts) direction for self-advocacy, but also outlines how
administrators and faculty can strengthen their departments through their
interactions and support of adjuncts.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“On Compassionate Grounds:  Eldercare Policies and Practices in Academic Institutions”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Chantal Lemire (Western University)</p>


<p>By 2050, nearly 22% of the global population will be over the age of sixty
(United Nations, 2013). Despite some government programs designed to assist
aging individuals, most elderly people rely on spouses and family members for
help with basic day-to-day needs (Bauer &amp; Sousa-Poza, 2015; Smith, 1993).
Approximately 30% of Canadians and nearly 20% of Americans provide some form
of eldercare, such as assistance with transportation, meal preparation, and
managing household duties or finances (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013;
Turcotte, 2013). On average, informal eldercare providers spend 4 to 20 hours
per week on eldercare duties (Calvano, 2013; Turcotte, 2013).</p>

<p>In comparison with other work environments, academic institutions fall
behind with respect to the availability of eldercare services and support
(Raabe, 1997). While childcare is more streamlined into the work arrangements
of universities, eldercare seems to be discounted as significant work for
those in academia (Mann et al., 2011; Cummins, 2005), even though eldercare
providers require similar forms of workplace accommodation (Smith, 1993;
Gautun &amp;Hagen, 2010) and face similar workplace penalties to those
experienced by parents (Kim et al., 2011; Koerin et al., 2008). Through my own
experiences, together with the stories of individuals who struggle to take
time off teaching and research duties to care for elderly family members, I
hope to shed light on a substantial and growing cohort of caregivers whose
needs and experiences are not currently reflected in academic discourses or
organizational policies.  Given the growing population of eldercare providers,
the implications of care provision may be critical for many––perhaps
especially for those in the early and formative stages of their career, such
as while completing doctoral work and while working to obtain tenure.</p>
