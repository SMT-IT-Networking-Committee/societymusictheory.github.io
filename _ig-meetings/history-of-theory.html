<h1>History of Theory Interest Group Meeting</h1>

<p class="chair">Carmel Raz (Columbia University), Co-Chair<br>
                 Roger Mathew Grant (Wesleyan University), Co-Chair</p>


<p>We are pleased to feature the following presentation.  Prof. Schubert's
talk will be followed by our usual business meeting.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“One will easily understand later...”: Reading Musical Examples in Treatises"</p>
<p class="abs-author">Peter Schubert (McGill University)</p>


<p>While teachers and authors in the Renaissance were sometimes reluctant to
share all their secrets in their prose, they often hid important messages in
their musical examples. Some of these can change the way we think about the
authors, and, more importantly, about the music they addressed. I will show
instances that have gone overlooked from treatises by Thomas Morley, Gioseffo
Zarlino, Francisco de Montanos, and Pietro Cerone.</p>
