<h1>Music and Disability Interest Group Meeting</h1>

<p class="chair">Bruce Quaglia (University of West Georgia), Co-Chair<br>
                 Anabel Maler (University of Chicago), Co-Chair</p>

<p>We will begin with a short business meeting that will last no more than
fifteen minutes. This will then be followed by an informal seminar on The
Intersections of Sound Studies and Disability Studies in Music that will last
from 12:30 until approximately 1:45. We will be led for this seminar by noted
authors Mara Mills (NYU) and Jonathan Sterne (McGill University) who will be
joining us from The Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin
where they are presently co-authoring a book on the history of time stretching
and pitch shifting technology. Professors Mills and Sterne will be joining us
via Skype. Sumanth Gopinath (University of Minnesota) and Jennifer Iverson
(University of Chicago) will be our respondents, on site.</p>


<p>In preparation for this seminar, we ask that you read two short essays from
the volume Keywords in Sound Studies: Chapter 4 (Mills) “Deafness,” and
Chapter 6 (Sterne) “Hearing.” In addition, please also consider reading the
recent essay “Dismediation: Three Proposals and Six Tactics,” co-authored by
Mills and Sterne.</p>
