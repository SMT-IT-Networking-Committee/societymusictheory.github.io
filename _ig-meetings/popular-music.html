<p>The Popular Music Interest Group (PMIG) 2017 session will feature five
short repertoire presentations from scholars studying niche or
underrepresented genres of popular music, with the aim of educating the PMIG
about an artist or artists from that particular genre. Presentations will be
15 minutes followed by 5 minutes of questions and discussion.</p>

<p>We will also be presenting our annual publication awards, given to
publications within two years of the application deadline: (1) The PMIG
Outstanding Publication Award, given to an outstanding article on popular
music by a senior scholar and (2) The Adam Krims Award, which acknowledges the
work of an outstanding popular music publication by a junior scholar.</p>
