<p>The Russian Music Theory Interest Group is pleased to feature four
15-minute paper presentations: one invited (Inessa Bazayev, former Chair of
the Interest Group) and three selected through blind review. The papers apply
a variety of analytical approaches to works by Russian composers. We welcome
non-members as well as active members to our meeting.<p>

<p>The Russian Music Theory Interest Group brings together two overlapping
groups of scholars: those interested in researching and analyzing music by
Russian composers, and those familiar with the Russian-language
music-theoretical scholarship. We maintain a Google Group that serves as a
discussion forum and message board. Anyone may join the group—you do not need
a reading knowledge of Russian, and you do not need to be actively engaged in
Russian music analysis.</p>
