<p class="abs-title">Of Beginnings and Endings: P as Agent of Closure in Haydn’s Sonatas</p>
<p class="abs-author">Samantha Inman (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>Haydn’s themes often serve a variety of functions over the course of a movement. This idea often surfaces in discussions of his well-known “monothematic” sonatas, which feature a secondary theme (S) based on the primary theme (P). However, a lesser-known manifestation of this same principle involves the insertion of P-based material between S and C (closing material) in a sonata recapitulation. As outlined in <i>Elements of Sonata Theory</i>, Hepokoski and Darcy typically classify such a passage as a Coda-Rhetoric Interpolation (CRI). However, most P-based sections appearing late in Haydn’s recapitulations differ from a CRI by neither adopting coda-rhetoric nor functioning as true interpolations that suspend the progress of the recapitulation. </p>
<p>In Haydn’s sonatas, a P-based passage falling between S and C in a recapitulation often plays an integral role in the achievement of both tonal and rhetorical closure of the movement. These statements typically fall into one of three categorizes. The first entails a seemingly “extra” P statement, the second uses the additional P-statement to compensate for an earlier iteration that had been truncated or weakened, while the last reorders a trimodular block (TMB) to place the P-based portion last. Combining Sonata Theory with Schenkerian analysis, this paper illustrates each schema in turn through analysis of three representative string quartet movements by Haydn: Op. 50, No. 5/IV, Op. 50, No. 3/I, and Op. 64, No. 4/I. In each case, the P-based module proves crucial to the final stages of the sonata.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Cadential Content and Cadential Function in the First Movement Expositions of Schumann’s Violin Sonatas</p>
<p class="abs-author">Peter H. Smith (University of Notre Dame)</p>

<p>This paper analytically extends the theories of the classical cadence of William Caplin and Janet Schmalfeldt through exploration of cadential procedures in Robert Schumann—one of the most inventive manipulators of cadential techniques in the context of nineteenth-century instrumental forms. My focus, like Schmalfeldt’s, is sonata exposition, exemplified by two generically related compositions illustrating the ingenuity of Schumann’s cadential practice. In the first movements of his Violin Sonatas, opera 105 and 121, Schumann reimagines cadential strategies derived from eighteenth-century sonata form as integral components of his distinctive compositional voice. He is thus seen to compose not at cross-purposes with signature elements of the classical style, as Charles Rosen has argued, but rather to exploit eighteenth-century conventions as a means to achieve his innovative artistic ends.</p>
<p>The secondary key areas of these movements illustrate Schumann’s propensity for formal strategies based on <i>an ironic separation of cadential content from cadential function</i>. His passages of cadential content paradoxically serve to: (1) initiate the secondary area; (2) develop tonal pairing rather than polarity as a foundation for expository harmonic relationships; and (3) either delay (op. 121) or withhold (op. 105) across the secondary area, the arrival of the mediant <i>Stufe</i>. Throughout, Schumann is seen to draw on classical conventions not epigonistically but as integral components of his vital nineteenth-century formal-tonal processes.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Mixing the Generic and Parageneric: Introductory Zero-Modules in Beethoven’s Late String Quartets</p>
<p class="abs-author">Catrina Kim (Eastman School of Music)</p>

<p>Among the many formal innovations of Beethoven’s late works is the strategic dissolution of formal boundaries. In his sonata forms, this often involves blurring the line between generically-prescribed sonata space and optional introductions and codas. Hepokoski & Darcy’s <i>parageneric space</i> encapsulates this framing music that lies outside the generic norms of the sonata, while their <i>zero-module </i>(e.g. P<sup>0</sup>) categorizes certain kinds of “introductions” as part of the sonata form. But mixtures of the introduction and the P<sup>0</sup> module (“introductory zero-modules”) occur frequently, such that the same music is both preparatory and initiatory. This raises the question: when an introduction is combined with the work itself, is the very line between the quotidian and the aesthetic somehow blurred? I bring the question into focus by considering the role of the introductory zero-module in the opening movements of Beethoven’s Opp. 127, 130, and 132, invoking along the way Schmalfeldt’s “becoming arrow” and Martin & Vande Moortele’s “left-right double arrow.” Each of the introductory zero-modules unexpectedly reappears in the second rotation, disrupting the sonata’s trajectory; at the onset of the third rotation, the introductory zero-module is just as unexpectedly absent. I ask the following questions: How can one distinguish between the zero-module and the truly parageneric in the sonata? Does Beethoven’s use of introductory zero-modules coalesce into a single procedure or set of similar procedures? How useful is the dichotomy between inside-sonata and outside-sonata in the context of late Beethoven?</p>

<p class="abs-title">Reconciling Bottom-Up Harmonic Function with Top-Down Schenkerian Theory within Fugal Analysis</p>
<p class="abs-author">Peter Franck (Western University, Canada)</p>

Within his landmark study, <i>Analyzing Fugue: A Schenkerian Approach</i>, William Renwick views fugue from a top-down perspective. Schenker does as well, though he claims that “the fugues of J. S. Bach . . . are always determined by the subject, by its dimensions and harmonic content, and are controlled by a fundamental structure.” This paper endeavors to reconcile such top-down and bottom-up approaches to fugal analysis by exploring J. S. Bach’s Fugue in D Major, from the <i>Well-Tempered Clavier</i>, Book II, the fugue-subject of which occurs within numerous harmonic contexts. The paper is in three parts. First, it offers multiple harmonic readings of the subject and answer that arise from the subject’s initial D–G interval, allowing for tonic (T), predominant (PD), and dominant (D) functional beginnings, depending upon the subject’s opening harmony and initial melodic chord-tone (CT). Such functional ambiguity creates expectations for the inevitable arrival of a subject-entry that begins, unequivocally, on the root of a T-functioning harmony. Second, based upon the harmonic readings, the paper presents a formal plan of the fugue corresponding to the opening CT and harmonic function of each subject-entry group. Third, the paper compares the formal plan to Schenkerian readings of the fugue. Specifically, the comparison highlights how changes in metrical alignments between entry-beginnings and their supporting tonics correspond to the progression of scale-degrees within the <i>Urlinie</i>. In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that bottom-up (functional) readings of the subject complement, rather than compete with, top-down (Schenkerian) readings of the fugue.
