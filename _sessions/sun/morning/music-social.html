<p class="abs-title"><i>Música Popular</i> and the Invention of National Art Music in Brazil</p>
<p class="abs-author">Chelsea Burns (University of Chicago)</p>

<p>This paper presents an analytical exploration of concert music in Brazil in the late 1920s, a period in which written discourse contradicts musical practice. At this time, critics and composers alike discussed the incorporation of vernacular elements into art music; indeed, the suggestion of the popular became the chief marker of nationalism in Brazilian art music of this period. Individuals disagreed, however, about how the “popular” ought to be defined, and how best to incorporate it within the repertory. </p>
    <p>Heitor Villa-Lobos’s <i>Chôros No. 4</i> (1926) presents one example of this friction between music and discourse. The work is divided into a “learned” section and a “vernacular” section; the two are roughly pasted together, leaving an audible seam between <i>música popular </i>and its counterpart, <i>música erudita</i>. In his treatment of the popular, Villa-Lobos directly contradicts the edicts of tastemaker Mário de Andrade, who was far and away the most prominent and powerful musicologist and critic in modernist Brazil. Andrade argued that rural musics should represent the popular, and that these should be deeply integrated into compositions, rather than placed on the surface as exotic elements. By separating out the popular, and using urban materials (<i>choro</i>, from which the work takes its name), Villa-Lobos contradicts Andrade’s artistic mandates.</p>
    <p>To contextualize this approach among others, I touch upon composers Francisco Mignone and Luciano Gallet, who used different techniques to integrate <i>popular </i>and <i>erudita</i>. This comparative talk thus illuminates ways in which discourse and practice interact and diverge in 1920s Brazilian art music.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Music Imitating Machines, Machines Imitating Humans: Industrialization and the Three Categories of Mechanical Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Allison Wente (University of Texas at Austin)</p>

<p>By the early twentieth century the machine aesthetic was a well-established and dominant interest. While numerous scholars have examined this aesthetic in art and literature, musical compositions representing industrialized labor practices and the role of the machine in music remain largely unexplored. In this paper, I use labor as a lens to examine how a culture of mechanization embeds itself in music in the early twentieth century. More specifically, I organize “machine music” into three categories: (1) music written to sound like or imitate the machine (2) music written to highlight the skills of virtuoso performers while also showcasing the machine and (3) music written specifically for machines. These categories encompass a wide variety of performing bodies, audiences, and spaces, evidencing the widespread influence of the machine aesthetic on early twentieth-century music culture.</p>
<p>I give examples for each category, highlighting common features of machine music: steady rhythms lacking metrical hierarchy, instrumentation emphasizing percussion and woodwinds, and disjunct, repetitive string lines. These mechanically influenced commonalities connect examples spanning from film (Charlie Chaplin’s <i>Modern Times</i>), popular music of the time (Zez Confrey’s “Kitten on the Keys”), and the avant-garde (George Antheil’s <i>Ballet Mécanique</i>). Each example illuminates a different aspect of the musical machine and represents just one of many options within these categories. The machine age does not leave its musical accompaniment untouched as late nineteenth-century music fades out to the tunes of ragtime and the avante-garde.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Typologies of Intertextuality in Recent Social Movements </p>
<p class="abs-author">Noriko Manabe (Princeton University)</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter, pro-democracy in Hong Kong, the Japanese antinuclear movement—the music of social movements, both recent and historical, share the use of intertextuality. This intertextuality captures listeners’ attention with a familiar song or genre, which a wholly new song would not have; reduces the hurdles of creation, allowing political songs to be written in a timely manner; and fuses listeners’ feelings about the contexts the song references with current issues (Turino). </p>
<p>Starting from Genette and Lacasse, I formulate a typology of intertextuality in protest music: hypertextual approaches including covers (sometimes with changed lyrics), hip-hop remakes, mash-ups, remixes, and allegories; shorter quotations; paratextual practices, such as advertising; and architextual style adoption. This typology helps us not only to identify the methods used in protest, but also to understand the circumstances in which some methods are more effective than others. To illustrate, I compare examples from several recent movements, examining intertextual technique against political usage. </p>
<p>Cover songs with changed lyrics receive broad distribution on the internet and inspire mass participation in protests (e.g., “Do You Hear the People Sing,” Hong Kong). Quotations are emotion-provoking indexes, like the Ferguson witnesses in J. Cole’s “Be Free.” Allegories are favored for recordings in censorial or dictatorial environments (e.g., Japan, Brazil). Musicians adopt musical genres for their associations (e.g., festival dance by Japanese antinuclear musicians). These intertextual methods build solidarity and allow communication when direct protest is inadvisable. Through this typology, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of music’s roles in political movements.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Speculative Hermeneutics, Scottish Memory, and James Dillon’s String Quartet No. 6 </p>
<p class="abs-author">Sumanth Gopinath (University of Minnesota)</p>

<p>The remarkable compositions of James Dillon are complex in ways not necessarily appreciated within the discourse of the New Complexity, to which the Scottish composer has been unwillingly yoked since the late 1980s. In this presentation I argue that the very elusiveness of Dillon’s expressively powerful and finely wrought music, itself inextricable from his verbal discourse in writings and interviews, raises provocative questions for musical hermeneutics—this being highly relevant, given his placing importance on meaning, narrative, and “symbolic levels” in his music. Drawing on the composer’s essay “Speculative Instruments” and on personal conversations, I propose the pleonasm “speculative hermeneutics” to denote a diagnostic form of interpretive inquiry based on highly conditional constructive descriptions. An inquiry suited to a speculative hermeneutics is occasioned by the composer’s <i>String Quartet No. 6 </i>(2010), dedicated to the memory of the Scottish trade union activist and political leader, James “Jimmy” Reid, who died near the end of the composition’s creation. Given the latter’s limited <i>poietic</i> relevance to the compositional process, this study instead investigates possible homological and other interpretive relationships between aspects of Reid’s life and work and the quartet’s semiotic and structural features—focusing in particular on the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in (1971–72).</p>
