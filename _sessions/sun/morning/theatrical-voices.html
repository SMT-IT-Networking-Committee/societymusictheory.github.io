<p class="abs-title">Scoring for Celebrity: The Authority of the Vocalist in <em>Love in a Village</em> (1762)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Berta Joncus (Goldsmiths, University of London)</p>


<p>In pastiche opera, the art of the star trumped that of the author, as <em>Love in a Village</em>, the eighteenth-century London stage’s most popular comic opera, richly evidences. My research as lead editor for the critical edition (Bärenreiter, 2016) reveals the defining contributions of its principal tenor, John Beard. As a star, and the new manager of Covent Garden, Beard used this opera to advance his reputation for both performance and directorship.</p>
<p><em>Love in a Village</em> was designed around Beard’s “line,” a metacharacter constructed on stage and off; it created new lines for the sopranos Charlotte Brent and Isabella Hallam. Beard chose to adapt <em>The Village Opera</em> (1729), likely because it featured two sentimental heroines. Beard hired the arranger Edward Toms (not Thomas Arne as earlier believed), known for tailoring music to singers. As in its ballad opera original, the wordbook accommodated atomized, liminal musical numbers for singers to represent their fictional characters and themselves. The character of Hawthorn, newly invented for Beard, led the musical finales. It gave Beard the chance to enact, with his dog Phillis, his reputation as a clubbable, honest, virile English gentleman. Hawthorn’s music is a deft cross-section of Beard’s repertory, with one air from his rival Thomas Lowe. For Brent and Hallam, Toms arranged Italian music performed by London’s reigning prima donnas, giving the young English first ladies a chance to eclipse their Italian counterparts. Framed by a plot in which they were intimate friends, Brent and Hallam also enacted concord, countering the “rival queens” topos habitually ascribed to twinned sirens.</p>
<p><em>Love in a Village</em> heralded the elevated taste by which Beard, as manager, sought to distinguish Covent Garden. The wordbook’s humble origins were hidden. The music was polite, taken from Handel, and from theatre and pleasure garden repertory. Only low characters sang common tunes, although even these melodies, because seemingly Scottish, carried a whiff of fashion.</p>
<p>In repertoire, <em>Love in a Village</em> became a staple for launching debutante sopranos, proving the effectiveness of its design for the production of stars and of musical taste.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Orpheus, Timotheus, and the Politics of Voice in Enlightenment Italy</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jessica Peritz (University of Chicago)</p>

<p>When the castrato Giuseppe Millico stepped onstage as Orpheus (Parma, 1769), he became the first of several “castrati of sensibility” to portray Gluck’s poet-singer in Enlightenment Italy. Along with other such singers as Guadagni and Pacchierotti, Millico parlayed his Orphic turn into an alternative to the virtuosic voices of opera seria. He later offered an account of that 1769 performance as a model for his ethos of this Orphic voice: in order to replicate the moral effects of his performance, other singers should “dress themselves in the sentiments of the poet” (preface, <em>La pietà d’amore,</em> 1782), thereby animating the poet’s characters through subjective, emotional engagement.</p>
<p>This Orphic alternative did not entirely convince critics like Planelli and Arteaga, who continued to advocate for tighter restrictions upon singers’ aesthetic agency. What if, instead, singers could be reined in, their voices co-opted and transformed into tools for political edification? Count Rezzonico explored such a transformation in his libretto for Sarti’s <em>Alessandro e Timoteo</em> (Parma, 1782). Like <em>L’atto d’Orfeo</em>, <em>Alessandro e Timoteo</em> hinges upon the supernatural power of a lyre-plucking singer (played by a castrato) to move his auditors’ emotions. But unlike Orpheus, Timotheus masks his pathos: he dissembles his own subjectivity in order to wield his voice as an instrument of anti-absolutist critique. Rezzonico thus implies that voice, sundered from the singer’s subjectivity, possesses a unique, immanent power—even the potential to build and destroy civilizations.</p>
<p>This paper traces the rise in the late Settecento of these two intertwined models of voice, exploring the interstices between voice, expression, and agency in discourses surrounding opera reform. Rezzonico’s two Parmesan operas exemplify these models in the context of the Bourbon-Habsburg “new Athens,” with <em>Orfeo</em> as the voice of subjectivity, and <em>Alessandro e Timoteo</em> as the voice of edification. Beyond Parma, the paper considers other contemporary writings, including Bettinelli’s <em>Dell’entusiasmo</em> (1769) and Borsa’s <em>La musica imitativa</em> (1781)<em>,</em> showing how related ideologies of voice were emerging across Italy as part of a broader cultural shift: from voice as codified <em>ancien régime</em> spectacle, to voice as contested site of individual subjectivity.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Monteverdi, Cavalli, “Natural” Depiction of Affection, and the Principle of Dialogue</p>
<p class="abs-author">Hendrik Schulze (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>One of the recurring debates regarding opera in the seventeenth century concerned the question of verisimilitude. While by the 1640s the initial problem of representing dramatic action in sung speech had been overcome, a new question arose—how to depict the varying affections of human interaction in a natural way, in both text and music. Hitherto the solution had been to focus on the individual protagonists’ affective reactions to changes in fortune—such as Monteverdi’s Orfeo in the eponymous opera. Their long, passionate speeches had become something of a liability by the 1640s, when plot structures were introduced into Venetian opera that were based on the interactions of multiple characters. This change, from epic to dramatic narration, had made the characters’ long speeches obsolete. A closer analysis of the librettos and stylistic deliberations by librettists such as Nicolò Minato (a collaborator of composer Francesco Cavalli in the 1650s and 1660s) will reveal a keen sense of varying the pace of dialogue as an expression of affection. This issue is equally present in the music; Cavalli set certain kinds of recitative in score, with individual parts for each character, thus allowing for overlaps, interjections, and sudden changes of pace, a much more natural depiction of dialogue. The principle of verisimilitude in dialogue thus had become an answer to the problem of depicting affect, both in text and in music.</p>
<p>However, as this paper will show, this development was not an invention of the librettists. A new reading of the extant scores of Claudio Monteverdi’s <em>Incoronazione di Poppea</em> will reveal that in Monteverdi’s original composition the score notation that we find in Cavalli’s operas must also have been present (and was subsequently abolished by copyists who were intent on saving space). Interestingly, these passages occur mostly at points where Monteverdi’s setting significantly deviates from Gian Francesco Busenello’s libretto, changing the librettist’s long and rather formal speeches into fast-paced dialogue. The findings of this paper will help to greatly advance our understanding of Venetian opera’s musical dramaturgy, and they will also contribute to an ongoing discussion on the principles of editing these operas.</p>


<p class="abs-title"><em>Ahi ghidy, Ahi Chavo</em>: Racialized Difference and Theatrical Sound on the Early Modern Italian Stage</p>
<p class="abs-author">Emily Wilbourne (Queens College / Graduate Center, CUNY)</p>

<p>The capture and enslavement of good, Christian citizens was a well-worn plot device of the early modern Italian stage. An ideal justification for any long disappearance or the scenic backdrop to stories set in Middle Eastern climes, slavery was at once outlandish, thrillingly exotic, and yet vaguely plausible. After all, it did sometimes happen: the <em>capocomico</em> Francesco Andreini reputedly spent eight years enslaved to the Turks before escaping and turning to the stage.</p>
<p>In such stories, slavery is always part of a confrontation with a religious and ethnically differentiated “other”: Turkish, Moorish, Persian, or Egyptian, the Islamic identities of such characters render them distinctly foreign. While in many cases, this otherness is merely a costume change, in those instances where sound participates in representation, the play of intelligible and unintelligible noise reflects the aurality of racialized difference in the seventeenth-century imagination. In Giovan Battista Andreini’s 1622 commedia dell’arte play, <em>La Sultana</em>, the Turkish and Moorish characters make frequent recourse to song, and, while no incidental music survives, the stage directions provide explicit instructions for how the musical elements worked. In addition, the dialogue given to the various “Turkish” characters differed audibly from that of the “Italian” characters; linking the sound of their music to the sounds of their speech illustrates the broad cultural parameters by which difference was represented and helps thicken our understanding of contemporary performance, representation, and reception. Importantly, the rich aural traces of this particular text provide a means to reinterpret similar representational strategies in contemporary operas. While recent scholarship testifies to a growing interest in the mechanisms of musical exoticism and representations of racial difference in early modern Italy, the notated musical traces remain stubbornly consistent with European musical traditions, such that it is difficult to identify moments of specifically exoticized sound. Extrapolating from the rare testimony of Andreini’s <em>La Sultana</em>, however, this paper contextualizes the characterological choices of Venetian operatic composers of the midseventeenth century, providing a means to hear the sounds of representational difference within the aural epistemology of the Italian theatre.</p>
