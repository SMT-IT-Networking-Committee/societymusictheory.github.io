<p class="abs-title">The Schaffner Manuscripts: Musical Commonplacing in an Age of Print</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christa Evans (Princeton University)</p>

<p>In the 1790s and early 1800s, Lancaster, Pennsylvania resident Casper Schaffner (1767–1825) copied around 1,000 pages of music into several bound commonplace books. The two keyboard manuscripts and one vocal manuscript document a richer and more diverse amateur musical culture than was previously thought to be in any one geographic location in America at this time. Indeed, Schaffner’s collection includes mid-eighteenth-century German lieder and keyboard suites, popular English sonatas and theatrical music, and music by American composers including sonatinas, marches, and Masonic songs.</p>
<p>Beyond expanding our knowledge of how long and how far printed music may have circulated, Schaffner’s collection leads us away from a composer-centric world into that of the eighteenth-century American amateur musician, where composers are hardly worth noting and musical text is fluid rather than fixed. Schaffner routinely alters the music he copies, reorganizing suites, choosing one or two single movements from entire printed volumes, and even truncating works of particular composers. His approach to music, however, changed throughout the manuscripts, and in this we witness the changing tastes of an individual during a formative time in American history and the American music industry.</p>
<p>While the number of Schaffner’s manuscripts that survive is unusual, the practice of copying printed music into manuscripts was common in America at this time; Schaffner in fact even lived next door to musicians who also kept music commonplace books. In this paper, I relate the practice of keeping music manuscripts to the broader Enlightenment culture of commonplacing described by John Locke, who believed such collections were essential to organize and assist in the recollection of the diverse and complex material the creator knew and valued. The culture of commonplacing blossomed alongside the growing availability of print, or as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote, “the horrible mass of books which keeps on growing.” This growing mass included printed music. Providing a window into the turn-of-the-nineteenth-century American home, commonplace music manuscripts tell us a great deal about printed musical culture and the musicians who consumed it.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Printing National Music: Form and Content in Post-Revolutionary America</p>
<p class="abs-author">Glenda Goodman (University of Pennsylvania)</p>

<p>When Isaiah Thomas announced his new venture, <em>The Massachusetts Magazine</em>, in 1788, he promised a regular supply of newly composed pieces of music. This was a bold promise; most <em>belles lettres</em> periodicals featured compositions that had appeared in print elsewhere, usually from European publications. Yet Thomas was confident; the Worcester, Mass. publisher and printer had already experienced music-publishing success with his collection of sacred hymns, <em>The Worcester Collection</em> (1786). Music would make up only a fraction of the contents of <em>The Massachusetts Magazine</em>; surely he would find in the United States composers who were as eager as he to promote the new nation’s cultural rise? Indeed, the number of active American-born composers increased dramatically in the post-Revolutionary period, and their efforts, reflected in the contents of hymn-tune collections published in the 1780s and ’90s, were believed to distinguish the United States musically from Europe. Thomas hoped—wrongly, as it turned out—to receive plenty of material from composers, particularly those who lived in New England.</p>
<p><em>The Massachusetts Magazine</em> tells an important story about music in print in the eighteenth century and the cultural history of the early American Republic. And yet, the music in eighteenth-century periodicals has received scant scholarly attention. In fact, most scholars working on original music compositions in early national America focus on the sacred music published in tunebooks. As Richard Crawford and others have pointed out, tunebooks give us the first examples of homegrown American composers and were often quite popular with American audiences. However, periodicals—which featured secular repertory meant for personal entertainment rather than religious worship—also circulated to a large audience and thus deserve further attention. Building on recent work on music and book history by scholars such as Kate van Orden, this paper analyzes the contents of <em>The Massachusetts Magazine</em> and, importantly, the printing technology Thomas used. I show that, in both form and content, <em>The Massachusetts Magazine</em> expands to our view of music and print culture and sheds light on the limitations in attempts to use print to promote cultural nationalism in the eighteenth century.</p>
