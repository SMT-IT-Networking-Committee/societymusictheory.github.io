<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>Running like a red thread through a century and a half of Mendelssohn reception is the image of the composer as a “classicist” whose music was, for better or worse, deeply rooted in earlier forms and styles. This old cliché gains new significance in light of the recent forays made into music of the nineteenth century by the “new <em>Formenlehre</em>”—the branch of theory and analysis inspired mainly by the work of William Caplin and of James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy. Mendelssohn’s music has become emblematic of that of a whole generation: as the first major composer to engage with sonata form in the decades immediately following Beethoven, his instrumental repertoire assumes fundamental importance for any account of the development of large-scale musical form in the Romantic era. However, Mendelssohn’s role in this development is still critically unexamined. Little analytical work has been undertaken even within specialist Mendelssohn circles, and new <em>Formenlehre</em>-based theoretical models for large-scale nineteenth-century form are only starting to be advanced. the four papers in this panel thus aim to revise and refine our theoretical understanding of large-scale Romantic form by examining the specific case of Mendelssohn’s sonata movements (as exemplified by his chamber works, symphonies, and concert overtures), and as a valuable corollary, to deepen our analytical appreciation of Mendelssohn’s instrumental music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Mendelssohn and Sonata Form: The Case of op. 44 no. 2</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benedict Taylor (University of Edinburgh)</p>

<p>In a groundbreaking 1974 paper the German musicologist Friedhelm Krummacher offered a series of “theses” concerning Mendelssohn’s mature sonata style, using the opening movement of the String Quartet in E minor, op. 44 no. 2 (1837), as his paradigmatic example. In a succession of detailed analytical points, Krummacher took issue with earlier, often highly superficial characterizations of Mendelssohn’s sonata practice. Yet for all his revisionary zeal and acumen, what is conspicuous on rereading this account today is how those elements that would appear to modern theorists as crucial to this movement’s design are passed over with little or no consideration. In this paper I offer both a concise new analysis of Mendelssohn’s paradigmatic quartet movement and a self-reflexive critique of the historical contingency of the methods of any such analytical method in trying to come to an understanding of this composer’s music. I focus on four key aspects of this movement: 1) the preparation of the subordinate theme by a Medial Caesura on the wrong dominant and lack of any EEC thereafter; 2) the formal elision of the point of recapitulation; 3) the process of expansion or extension to tight-knit lyrical phrase types seen throughout the exposition; and 4), at the largest level, the deferment, overriding or sidestepping of expected points of large-scale harmonic articulation until the coda. My concluding section offers, in turn, new theses concerning the nature of Mendelssohn’s mature sonata practice, preparing the following papers in the session.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Mendelssohn’s Piano Trio op. 66 and the Analysis of Romantic Form</p>
<p class="abs-author">Julian Horton (Durham University)</p>

<p>The dual influence of form-functional theory and sonata deformation theory has in recent years sustained progress towards a <em>Formenlehre</em> for nineteenth-century instrumental music. Extensions of Janet’s Schmalfeldt’s work (2011) acknowledging its debt to William Caplin have encompassed Schubert (Martin and Vande Moortele 2014), Mendelssohn (Horton and Wingfield 2012) and the Romantic piano concerto (Horton 2011 and 2015, Taylor 2016); sonata deformation theory has annexed new territory in the nineteenth-century repertoire (for example Hepokoski 2012, and Monahan 2011 and 2014).</p>
<p>Drawing on the model developed in Horton 2015 and Horton and Wingfield 2012, this paper situates Schmalfeldt’s concept of “becoming” as one of six central categories of Romantic formal syntax: functional transformation (“becoming”); proliferation (expansions of classical intra-thematic models); functional truncation; cadential deferral; functional elision; and parametric counterpoint (Smith 2005 and Webster 2009). This categorical framework is applied in an analysis of the first movement of Mendelssohn’s Piano Trio, op. 66 (1845), a movement in which interacting processes of functional transformation, elision and cadential deferral fundamentally problematize late-eighteenth-century notions of sonataformal demarcation. In turn, these tactics unseat the regressively classicist image prevailing in post-Wagnerian Mendelssohn reception: in op. 66, the music’s Mozartian facility masks a distinctively post-classical technical radicalism.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Expansion and Recomposition in Mendelssohn’s Symphonic Sonata Forms</p>
<p class="abs-author">Steven Vande Moortele (University of Toronto)</p>

<p>In several key contributions to the theory of formal functions, Janet Schmalfeldt and William Caplin have studied the techniques classical composers use to achieve structural expansion in the subordinate theme groups of their sonata forms. This paper builds on these authors’ work, modifying and recalibrating their “classical” tools for the analysis of romantic form and applying them to the subordinate themes from four of Mendelssohn’s symphonic sonata forms: the first movements of the “Reformation” and “Italian” symphonies, and the overtures <em>The Hebrides</em> and <em>Ruy Blas</em>.</p>
<p>A recurring strategy in these works is to present a short, tight-knit subordinate theme that is then repeated and progressively expanded, significantly delaying the arrival of the concluding PAC. While many of the techniques this involves are familiar from classical form (e.g., abandoned and evaded cadences, ECPs, and the “one-more-time” technique), they appear here in novel constellations and in combination with new techniques, including linkage between adjacent units, continuations interrupted by off-tonic presentations, infiltration of thematic material from earlier units, and proliferation of individual techniques. Moreover, the process of expansion begun in the exposition may be continued and intensified in the recapitulation, becoming part of a broader strategy of recapitulatory recomposition.</p>
<p>Neither a study of Mendelssohn’s practice entirely on its own terms nor a direct comparison to classical models does justice to this blend of old and new. Instead this paper balances “positive” and “negative” approaches to romantic form, acknowledging its commonalities with classical form without reverting to a unidirectional model of “norm” and “deformation.”</p>

<p class="abs-title">Deformed Beauty? Form and Narrative in the <em>Overture to the Tale of the Fair Melusine</em>, op. 32</p>
<p class="abs-author">Thomas Grey (Stanford University)</p>

<p>The last of Mendelssohn’s popular and influential early concert overtures, the <em>Ouvertüre zum Mährchen von der schönen Melusine</em> of 1835, remains the least familiar of these works. It is also the most unusual with regard to formal design, comparable to Wagner’s overture to <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em> and the first movement of Schumann’s D minor Symphony (both from 1841) in the dialogic relation between introduction and sonata form functions. The relation of formal experiment to narrative “content” in Mendelssohn’s overture has remained elusive, although clearly influenced by a gendering of introduction, primary (P), and secondary (S) materials.</p>
<p>This paper considers the relation of formal procedure to the narrative dimension in the <em>Melusine</em> overture from several perspectives: versions of the trope of waterspirit or <em>ondine</em> betrayed by a human lover known to Mendelssohn but obscure today; the “deformation” classical sonata principles theorized as analytical and hermeneutic tool by James Hepokoski; Steven Vande Moortele’s proposal of an intra-generic study of concert and opera overtures and Janet Schmalfeldt’s notion of retrospective re-interpretation of formal functions as steps toward constructing alternative norms for the Romantic canon; and Benedict Taylor’s studies of a cyclic formal impulse in early Mendelssohn. A comparison by A. W. Ambros of op. 32 with a fresco-cycle by Moritz von Schwind suggests an alternative visual model for musical narrative. My reading reinforces familiar themes (Mendelssohn as “cautious” progressive) while raising new questions about Mendelssohn’s abandonment of the concert overture genre, arguably his most distinctive contribution to the music of the Romantic era.</p>
