<p class="abs-title">Highbrow Bullies and Lowbrow Menaces: Judgments of Music and Taste in Interwar BBC Periodicals</p>
<p class="abs-author">Emily C. Hoyler (School of the Art Institute of Chicago)</p>

<p>The terms “highbrow” and “lowbrow” came into the popular lexicon in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s. These seemingly oppositional terms were often used to evaluate aesthetic value and personal tastes in music. In the pages of the BBC’s weekly periodicals <em>Radio Times</em> and <em>The Listener</em>, critics and listeners argued for the relative merits of highbrow and lowbrow programming. Their discourses reveal a complex system of value judgments as these terms were levied to describe broadcast programs, musical genres, and listener demographics. Drawing from musicology, media studies, and social history, I argue that critical commentary and listener responses in these periodicals serve as barometers for interwar conceptions of cultural value in the BBC’s music programming.</p>
<p>Programming policies at the BBC suggested that the positive effects of “good music” could improve national character and enable a “great raising of public taste” among its listeners. Highbrow and lowbrow designations were invoked to describe the BBC’s initiatives for music appreciation, its understanding of its listenership, and its promotion of British national music and musicality. Listeners self-identified in various ways to complicate these binary terms, creating a brow spectrum that included “middlebrows” “adjustable brows,” and “sliding brows.” BBC critics and listeners alike referenced this brow spectrum to assess the educational worth, entertainment value, and popular appeal of music programming and music appreciation.</p>
<p>Featuring interwar excerpts from <em>Radio Times</em> and <em>The Listener</em>, my presentation will analyze signifiers of social class, national character, and aesthetic value that are evident in the language and references published in these periodicals. For example, contemporary art music and jazz tended to be cited as archetypal examples of highbrow and lowbrow music, respectively; listeners branded these genres with biased labels such as “education snob stuff” and “songs of the sickly love type.” I will also draw from contemporaneous monographs by BBC Director-General John Reith, the Hadow Committee, and Cecil Arthur Lewis to evaluate the BBC’s handling of the brow spectrum at the administrative level. Perceptions of interwar cultural hierarchies became evident as various genres and tastes were brought together through the new mass medium of radio broadcasting.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“It’s a Long Way to Tipperary . . .” and Tennessee: Unlikely Musical Exchanges in the English Country House during World War I</p>

<p>During the First World War, many soldiers from throughout the British Empire were sent to England first to train, then in many cases after time at the war front, to recover from wounds. For Canadians and Australians, such healing often took place alongside English soldiers in municipal buildings and other unlikely places throughout England, such as country stately homes. At the forefront of activities in which soldiers engaged to occupy time, boost morale, and foster healing while convalescing was music. Often this music was organized and led by upper-class women eager to do their “bit for King and country.” While soldiers—English and dominion alike—were certainly accustomed to singing and listening to musical performances at the front, especially due to the efforts of the YMCA, the raucous musical world they brought with them was new to the Edwardian country house and upper-class ladies’ soirees. Associated with British urban music halls and low-brow American culture, such bawdy songs were not the sentimental parlor room ballads and nineteenth-century opera excerpts Edwardian ladies were used to playing.</p>
<p>This paper highlights the collision of these musical worlds of the trench and country house during the First World War. Drawing on country house sheet music collections, soldiers and women’s correspondence and life writing, high society magazines, and newspapers of army battalions and Red Cross hospitals, this paper demonstrates the transnational and trans-class musical exchange of British and dominion Tommies with lady philanthropists disrupted the elite pre-war musical world of the Edwardian parlor. Here we see the democratization of musical space and practice, that both carries on and ruptures the rich tradition of domestic music making of the nineteenth century. Ultimately such exchanges, in addition to fostering physical and emotional healing, established new and unlikely musical networks within the Commonwealth—networks that complicated former boundaries of class, gender, and empire.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Articulating Allied Identity: Cross-Channel Musical Exchange between Paris and London during World War I</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rachel Moore (University of Oxford)</p>

<p>On 5 February 1915, a party of French politicians, musicians, and intellectuals boarded a ship on the coast of France and made the hazardous journey across the English Channel to take part in a series of musical and diplomatic events in London. At the heart of their trip was an “Entente Matinee,” held at His Majesty’s Theatre on 9 February. The program, performed by both French and English musicians, included a miscellany of French and English chamber music, opera excerpts, poetry readings, and Allied national anthems. These musical components were framed by a patriotic address from French academician Maurice Donnay on the nature and importance of the Franco-British and wider “Allied” alliance.</p>
<p>The 1915 Entente Matinee is one of many instances of wartime exchange between Paris and London in which music was used to forge cultural and political relationships and to create a sense of belonging to a national—or wider—cause. Existing studies of music’s role in the creation and contestation of wartime identities have largely been carried out within exclusively national limits; such studies rely on somewhat reductive notions of patriotism, overlooking a more nuanced and international understanding of the complexities of wartime identities. Drawing on French and English concert and theatre programs, government documents concerning propaganda, musician and government correspondence, and press documents, this paper combines ideas of nation with those of an emerging Allied force. It studies instances of musical exchange between the Allied metropolises of Paris and London to reveal how cross-channel musical performances both sustained and challenged national identities within the context of an emerging Allied Entente.</p>
<p>By investigating wartime musical life from a transnational perspective, this paper highlights how musical interaction between two capital cities united by a common enemy contributed to wider political and cultural articulations of an Allied identity. It reconsiders established conceptions of the nature and influence of wartime patriotism and nationalism, highlighting the pressures which multiple, often conflicting, cultural identities brought to bear on romantic ideas of “sacred union” and the unhindered civilian support for national and Allied war efforts that it entailed.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Near to Reality, but Not Quite”: Lena Ashwell’s Concerts at the Front during the First World War</p>
<p class="abs-author">Vanessa Williams (University of Pennsylvania)</p>

<p>Soon after the British Empire declared war against Germany on 4 August 1914, British actress and impresario Lena Ashwell had the idea of sending musicians and comedians abroad to entertain the troops. In January 1915 her “Concerts at the Front” series was officially sanctioned with the support of Princess Victoria and under the auspices of the YMCA. Over the next few years, concert parties consisting of male and female performers gave thousands of performances in make-shift venues to Allied troops in France, Malta, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Ashwell’s publicity campaigns for the concert parties persistently framed them not simply as entertainment but as a medical and educational benefit. The concerts diverted seriously wounded soldiers in hospitals, and also educated working-class troops who, she claimed, would request opera arias rather than music hall choruses. Her descriptions of the project legitimized its existence to the white middle classes who funded it, from her insistence on programs of classical favorites and light popular songs, with the absolute avoidance of music-hall songs and “ragtime,” to her casting of female artistes—for whom she had obtained special permission to travel to the front—in traditional roles of nurses and educators.</p>
<p>In this paper I use Ashwell’s writings alongside written documents and oral accounts from performers and soldiers that complicate her propaganda. These accounts ascribe alternative pastoral roles to the female performers precisely because of their exceptional status as women in male-dominated spaces. They focus on the female artists as social partners and embodiments of femininity and nationhood; they also highlight the performers’ extramusical labor both in war zones and on the Home Front, and the resulting communication loop that was unique to the work of Ashwell’s concert parties. My paper suggests an expanded conception of women’s contributions to the war effort, accounting for their work as traveling musicians and also more broadly for their abilities to temporarily bridge some of the physical and emotional boundaries between the Western and Home Fronts.</p>
