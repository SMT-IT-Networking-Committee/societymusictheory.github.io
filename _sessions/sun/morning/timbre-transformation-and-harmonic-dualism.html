<p class="abs-title">Timbrally-Marked Structures in Ravel’s Piano Concertos</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jennifer Beavers (University of Texas at San Antonio)</p>

<p>Ravel’s compositional career culminated with two rather different piano concertos: “in G” (1920–30) and “for the Left Hand” (1929–30). Overlapping in creative space, they not only share premiere years, but also showcase extraordinary orchestral timbre characteristic of Ravel’s late style. These compositions mark an interesting formal departure from earlier works since Ravel alters his method of recapitulation in comparison to earlier sonata forms (Heinzelmann 2011; Kaminsky 2004). Furthermore, heavy reliance on timbre and contour indicates a modification in compositional attention and artistic means, changes which are implicitly connected to Ravel’s declining cognitive state towards the end of his life. This paper shows how timbre marks the form at strategic junctures and offers alternate ways to interpret musical structure based on timbre.</p>
<p>I begin by identifying timbrally-marked moments within each concerto. The Concerto in G represents a timbre-defined form, in which two timbral shifts mark and transcend recapitulatory function. Timbre is elevated further as a form-generating device in the Concerto for the Left Hand. Ravel’s comment that the “concerto [is] divided into two parts…played without pause” (Ravel 1930) undersells its complicated structure. I posit that the movement’s complex web of motives can be divided into two types based on contour and timbre; the interaction between motive-types has far-reaching consequences for the latter half of the movement. In closing, I consider neurological findings of his cognitive decline (Baeck 2002; Seeley 2008; Sellal 2008) with regard to musical form and process, allowing us to experience timbre through a new lens.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Plagal Systems in the Songs of Fauré and Duparc</p>
<p class="abs-author">Andrew Pau (Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory)</p>

<p>In this paper, I examine the use of harmonic dualism and plagal progressions in selected songs of Fauré and Duparc. These composers used subdominant-function harmonies and plagal progressions in three main ways: tonic expansions, cadences, and T–D–S–T plagal cycles.</p>
<p>Fauré often used the static quality of an opening plagal expansion to create a sense of lingering, whether in a state of melancholy (“Tristesse”) or languorous longing (“Les roses d’Ispahan”). In Duparc’s “L’invitation au voyage,” the plagal progressions can be thought of as dualistic counterparts to authentic progressions, reflecting a looking-glass world that befits Baudelaire’s invitation to journey into an idealized landscape.</p>
<p>Fauré and Duparc also used plagal cycles to depict scenes of “nostalgic quietude” (Jankélévitch). Duparc’s “Au pays où se fait la guerre” begins with a plagal cycle that sets the scene for the tale of a medieval lady pining in her tower. In “Dans la forêt de Septembre,” Fauré employs larger-scale plagal cycles to depict a melancholic autumn scene. I argue that the plagal system ended up achieving in Fauré’s late songs not just theoretical equality, but full practical equality, with the authentic system.</p>
<p>Harmonic dualism often seems like “a theory in search of a repertoire” (Tymoczko). While academic discourse on the use of plagal effects in late nineteenthcentury music has tended to focus on Austro-German composers, most notably Brahms and Wolf, I suggest that plagal systems were equally, if not better, suited to the melancholic, nostalgic, fantastical, and escapist world of French song.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Puccini’s <em>Pelléas</em> and <em>Butterfly’s</em> Transformations of <em>Partimenti</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Timothy Jackson (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>Puccini’s interest in <em>Pelléas</em> began in 1902 with publication of the vocal score and hearing the opera in 1903. <em>Butterfly</em> adopts two signal ideas from <em>Pelléas</em>: 1) large-scale C-F# whole-tone tritonality, and 2) “irresolution” by ending the opera on the leading tone (LT). In <em>Pelléas’</em> Act 5, centered on D minor, C prolonged by F# (and vice-versa) functions as a whole-step lower-neighbor to D and an expansion of the opening D-C-D motto. At the end, this motto is chromatically deflected to D-C-C# or 1-7-#7 to conclude on C# major, the unresolved LT. In <em>Butterfly</em>, Puccini synthesizes Debussyisms with his own autochthonous <em>partimenti</em> structures: Act II becomes a C-F# whole-tone transformation of “Rule of the Octave” (RO). Comprising major triads ascending by whole step, RO is never stated in its “bare bones” form. The tritonal axis C-Gb (I-bV/#IV) usurps the role of the traditional tonic-dominant polarity; noteworthy is that the G flat/F sharp seventh chord holds the tritone E-Bb invariant. This E-Bb tritone, linearized when the whole-tone model progression is transposed down a step in Act 2, Part 2, becomes the ascending octave Bb (E-) Bb associated with the ultimate betrayal of Love. We now offer a new explanation for <em>Butterfly’s</em> enigmatic B minor conclusion. If B natural functions as a leading tone to the tonic C, then by ending the opera on B, the C completing RO is omitted to end <em>Butterfly</em>—<em>Pelléas</em>-like—on the LT.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Synergies of Musical and Poetic Transformation in Anton Webern’s Second Cantata, op. 31</p>
<p class="abs-author">Catherine Nolan (University of Western Ontario)</p>

<p>Transformational approaches to music analysis are generally associated with musical formalism. Supported by a disciplinary framework in mathematics and logic, transformational music analyses often direct attention to formalist relations between musical objects. And yet the idea of transformation is intrinsically poetic: something happens to an object to alter its profile. At the heart of the idea of transformation lie the dynamic and poetic notions of transmutation, agency, and signification.</p>
<p>The transformation concept enjoys a longstanding presence in analysis of twelve-tone works through the foundational role of defined serial transformations. Webern’s late choral works, however, are distinctive by virtue of their suffusion with the philosophical framework, metaphors, and imagery in their texts by poet Hildegard Jone. These works invite examination of the poetic resonance in musical transformations. In examining iterative metaphors in Jone’s texts, such as day↔night, darkness↔light, sound↔sight, earth↔heaven, life↔death, and death↔rebirth, we discover in Webern’s settings a high degree of holistic integration of musical and poetic transformation.</p>
<p>In this presentation I examine synergies of musical and poetic transformation in Webern’s last work, the Second Cantata, op. 31. Pitch and row transformations, in various guises, become musical cues for and expressions of iterative metaphors in the poetic texts. Transformational analogies relating row and pitch organization with poetic expression enrich analytical interpretation. Synergies of musical and poetic transformation in op. 31 bring attention to the unrecognized significance of Jone’s contributions to Webern’s oeuvre, and provide suggestive clues to Webern’s motivation for setting texts by Jone exclusively in his late choral works.</p>
