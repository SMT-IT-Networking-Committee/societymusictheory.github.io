<p class="abs-title">“Wut it is? Wut is up? Wut is wut?”: New York City’s Black Queer Rap as Genre</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lauron Kehrer (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>On 13 March 2014, the New York City-based rapper Le1f performed his 2012 single “Wut,” on the “Late Show With David Letterman.” With lines such as “I’m getting light in my loafers” and “I’m the kind of john closet dudes wanna go steady on,” the track explicitly points to Le1f’s queer identity. His appearance marked the first time an openly gay rapper performed on a major network’s late-night show, and Le1f is frequently cited as part of a larger trend of emerging queer hip-hop artists in and around New York City, including Zebra Katz, Cakes da Killa, Mykki Blanco, Azalea Banks, and others. And yet, Le1f himself has stated that he prefers not to be known as a purveyor of gay rap. As he said in an interview for <em>Philadelphia</em> magazine, “I’m proud to be called a gay rapper, but [my work is] not gay rap. That’s not a genre.”</p>
<p>This paper interrogates Le1f’s claim and argues that while there may not be a “gay rap” genre, many of New York City’s openly queer rappers use similar strategies for articulating their sexual identities in their music and that their work can be therefore be considered collectively. These artists often employ sonic, visual, and lyrical references to the city’s Ballroom scene, a mainstay of black and Latino queer culture of the past few decades, in order to invoke a specifically black queer musical and cultural lineage. Here I briefly trace that lineage from the emergence of disco and its successor, house music. I then consider the role of house music in ballroom culture and black LGBTQ communities, paying particular attention to the ways in which participants use music in the creation and performance of the ballroom gender system in which gender and sexuality are co-constructed. Finally, I demonstrate ways in which the aforementioned rappers utilize aspects of ballroom culture as a means to perform a black queer identity, and suggest that black queer rap that shares this cultural reference point can indeed be considered a hip-hop genre.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Brighton Beach Has Long Been Odessan”: Willi Tokarev and the Third Wave Soviet Jewish Immigrant Community in 1980s New York City</p>

<p>Beginning in the 1970s Soviet Jews immigrated to the United States in large numbers, many of them settling in New York City. In contrast to previous generations of Eastern European Jews, these “Third Wave” Jewish émigrés were distinctly shaped by their experiences in the USSR: they mainly spoke Russian rather than Yiddish, and during their years under antireligious Communist rule, many formed a sense of Jewish identity defined by its representations in Russian literature, music, and theater. As this group settled in Brooklyn’s Brighton Beach neighborhood, this seashore strip became known as “Little Odessa”—a nod to the Ukrainian city that Russian Jewish writer Isaac Babel mythologized as a profligate paradise for Jewish gangsters.</p>
<p>New immigrant-owned nightclubs and restaurants in Brighton cultivated a thriving music scene and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the neighborhood became a wellspring for Western-produced <em>shanson</em>, a term encompassing a broad range of Russian popular music genres including the <em>blatnaia pesnia</em> (criminal song), characterized by romanticized depictions of criminal subculture and frequent references to Odessa. Scholars have paid little attention to the massively popular body of Russian music subsumed under the <em>shanson</em> label, and still less to émigré musicians’ contributions to the genre. Brighton musicians, however, had a lasting impact on <em>shanson</em>, creating musical products that negotiated their experiences in the Soviet Union within an American context.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent émigré musicians in Brighton was Willi Tokarev (b. 1934). I analyze two of Tokarev’s songs—“New York Taxi Driver” and “Hello, Dear Emigrants”—focusing on the ways in which Tokarev modified the <em>blatnaia pesnia</em> tradition to depict immigrant life in New York City. In doing so, he presented the multi-layered Brighton community with a musical strategy of sorts—an avenue through which its members could understand their place in a new, radically different social setting. As one resident stated in 1987: “[Tokarev] sings what people feel . . . He sings about the émigrés who come to this country, their lives and problems, and what they miss about the old country. If you live in Brighton Beach, things are O.K., but anywhere else, you feel lonely and lost.”</p>
