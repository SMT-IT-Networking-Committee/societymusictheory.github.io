<p class="abs-title">The Gabrielli Mystique: Sovereignty, Fandom, and the Prima Donna in Late Eighteenth-Century Italian Opera</p>
<p class="abs-author">Margaret Butler (University of Florida)</p>

<p>The image of the prima donna brings to mind the iconic operas of Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, and Puccini; or public opera in seventeenth-century Venice; or Handel’s London operas. The prima donna’s function in Italian opera seria between 1750 and 1790, by contrast, has yet to receive the attention it merits. These decades witnessed the revitalization of Europe’s leading operatic genre, the expansion of the professional singer’s international network, a burgeoning culture of celebrity, and sovereignty’s transformation in an increasingly cosmopolitan Europe: all contexts in which the prima donna played a vital role.</p>
<p>Soprano Caterina Gabrielli (1730–96) eclipsed most other prima donnas in the views of mid- and late-eighteenth-century opera critics. One lauded her as “perhaps the greatest musician Italy has ever had”; Metastasio proclaimed her the “new star in the musical heavens.” John Rosselli, in his seminal study on opera singers, considered her to be the first modern female opera star. Wild contrasts pepper her biography: one reads of scandals and caprices alongside evidence of dignity, breeding, and intelligence; reports of timidity are juxtaposed with those of strength. Yet she constructed her image with an unprecedented degree of autonomy and control, creating a varied and international fan base. Although for many scholars she represents the quintessential eighteenth-century prima donna, the parameters for this assessment have yet to be established. How typical was her experience, how do the contrasts in her persona reflect norms of court and public sociability, and how might the hybrid nature of eighteenth-century opera seria theaters, at once court-sponsored and public, condition and complicate the creation of a celebrity’s public image at this time?</p>
<p>In this paper I examine Gabrielli within the framework of the careers and reception of three contemporaries, Lucrezia Agujari, Antonia Bernasconi, and Brigida Giorgi Banti, all successful prima donnas in opera seria. I draw on manuscript musical sources by the era’s leading composers (Traetta, Sarti, Sacchini, and Paisiello), encomia, librettos, and historiographical evidence to examine operatic celebrity in the late eighteenth century within opera seria culture, and the social and generic conventions that played into a prima donna’s rise to prominence.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“A Carnival or a Sacrament, a Fair or a Funeral”: The Prima Donna at the 1820s British Musical Festival, 1824</p>

<p>By the 1820s, the British musical festival expanded to more areas of Great Britain, and to a larger audience, featuring more members of the middle classes. To attract larger audiences, festival promoters hired the most famous opera prima donnas of the day. This led to an interesting tension between performers and festival organizers. The best and most famous singers—such as Angelica Catalani, Giuditta Pasta, and Maria Malibran—could demand lavish salaries. But they also frequently attempted to dictate both musical and aesthetic terms to festival organizers. In doing so, they threatened to unsettle established modes of male, amateur control.</p>
<p>In the 1820s, the most beloved and reviled prima donna in Great Britain was Angelica Catalani, and her behavior at festivals in 1824 was a catalyst for change. Traditionally, such festivals were organized by a group of gentleman amateurs for the sake of a local charity. Instead, Catalani produced a handful of speculative festivals that year. As the impresario for such festivals, Catalani chose the singers, instrumentalists, choir, conductor, and even the program for these festivals, and gained the profit if the festival were successful, or assumed the loss if not. By placing herself in the position of musical instigator and ultimate arbiter of programming and taste, Catalani threatened to upend decades of British festival tradition about the place of charitable music as controlled by the amateur enthusiast. The intense reaction against Catalani’s speculation—as well as the attempts of other divas, including Malibran, Pasta, and even British singers—to control some aspect of their own music making at festivals will be investigated through contemporary press accounts, correspondence with festival committees, and festival ephemera. This study will reveal a wide-ranging and public battle over the image of the opera singer outside of the opera house in the 1820s, where critics posited that the presence of divas cheapened the festival’s religious and public tradition and damaged the expanding audience’s nascent understanding of musical taste.</p>
