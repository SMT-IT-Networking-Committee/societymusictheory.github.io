<p class="abs-title">Reciprocal Interpretations of Music and Painting: Representation Types in Schuller, Tan, and Davies after Paul Klee</p>

<p>Diverse analytical strategies have been used by scholars to explicate musical works based on intertextual expressions of music and painting. Although highly valuable, these studies limit their music-theoretical discussions to composers’ responses to paintings. In this paper I examine some of the ways in which three compositions—Gunther Schuller’s <em>Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee</em> (1959), Peter Maxwell Davies’s <em>Five Klee Pictures</em> (1959/1976), and Tan Dun’s <em>Death and Fire</em> (1993)—lead a listener-observer to understand Paul Klee’s <em>Die Zwitschermachine</em> [The Twittering Machine, 1922] not only as influencing music composition but as one whose reception is influenced <em>by</em> composition as interpretation. I rely on theories that I term <em>descriptive</em> or <em>contextual representation</em> to provide the necessary concepts and vocabulary for explaining such reciprocal relations between music and painting. In <em>Descriptive representation</em>, the composer intentionally creates a metaphorical space between visual objects and sounds. This space remains, at some level, separate from both. For example, expressing the birds depicted in <em>Die Zwitschermaschine</em> as musical birdcalls suggests such a space linking the painting’s characters to the music. In contrast, <em>contextual representation</em> deals with interpretation through contexts added by listener-observers when completing elements not explicitly depicted in the artwork. For instance, a piece composed after <em>Die Zwitschermaschine</em> could allow listeners to interpret the twittering machine’s mode of operation, which is left undetermined in the painting. Observers of Klee’s canvas, empowered with the musical thought of the three composers, may apperceive the painting anew through interpretive listening that involves descriptive and contextual representation.</p>

<p>Unlike better-known forms of musical multimedia in which music and image both contribute to narrative development, visual music organizes images in time according to musical processes and is frequently non-narrative, or “absolute.” Fueled by nineteenth-century beliefs about absolute music’s expressive power, visual music underwent a period of experimentation and popularization in the twentieth century and is now undergoing an artistic revival. My paper briefly outlines this history, addresses issues of genre, and presents a set of considerations for undertaking analysis. While Cook (1998) dismissed selected works as being premised too narrowly on similarity relations, this paper assumes that even the most simplistic musical visualization entails both congruence and dissonance due to the inherent complexity of musical textures. Visual events function as accents, drawing attention to selected musical processes, but they also have the potential to mask or contradict other features of the music. With this in mind, I analyze selected works of musical visualization illustrating a wide range of possible techniques, including an immersive video installation entitled <em>The Great Modernists: Kazimir Malevich</em> (2015), a computerized animation of Nancarrow’s “Study no. 37 for Player Piano” by composer-designer Stephen Malinowski (2014); <em>Invisible Acoustics</em>, a cymatics installation by Dagny Rewera (2013); a performance painting by Mark Rowan-Hull (2013) to Cornelius Cardew’s <em>Treatise</em>; and the abstract film <em>An Optical Poem</em> by Oskar Fischinger (1937). Contrary to assumptions, these works often avoid audio-visual correlations guided by conventional cross-sensory metaphors.</p>
