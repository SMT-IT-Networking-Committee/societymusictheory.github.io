<p class="abs-title">Enharmonic Equivalence as an Equivalence Relation</p>
<p class="abs-author">Julian Hook (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Mathematicians have developed the notion of <i>equivalence relations</i> to codify situations in which objects may be “the same” in some significant way without being identical. In music, <i>octave</i>, <i>transpositional</i>, and <i>inversional</i> equivalence are well-known, and recent work in geometric music theory has called attention to the importance of <i>permutational</i> and <i>cardinality</i> equivalence. Formal aspects of <i>enharmonic equivalence</i> (EE) have received comparatively little scholarly attention. EE differs fundamentally from other musical equivalence relations in its dependence upon notation and its complex relationship to diatonic collections. The construction of the circle of fifths from the line of fifths via EE resembles the construction of the pitch-class circle via octave equivalence (OE), and the same twelve pitch classes arise either way, though the underlying spaces and equivalence relations are very different. Both constructions share a common origin in a space of octave-labeled note names. Both octave and enharmonic equivalence can be defined on this space, and the two may be applied in either order. Applying EE first yields a line of discrete pitches on which OE may be defined; applying OE first yields a note-name space on which EE is defined. This paper will review the fundamental properties of equivalence relations and then explore, somewhat mathematically, relationships among various descriptions of enharmonic equivalence, and between EE and other equivalence relations. Several pertinent note-name spaces will be presented and illustrated, and the related notion of <i>generic equivalence</i> will also be described.</p>

  Twentieth Century </p>
<p class="abs-author">Jason Yust (Boston University)</p>

<p>Theories of twentieth-century music have trended away from the totalizing spirit of Allen Forte’s set-theory project. Yet, his idea that the widely applicable principles of <i>intervallic structure </i>and <i>inclusion</i> <i>relations</i> could serve as the foundation for such a theory merits revival in light of recent developments in applying the <i>discrete</i> <i>Fourier transform (DFT) </i>to pcsets, first proposed by David Lewin and developed into a “fuzzy set theory” by Ian Quinn. The DFT segregates set class features from transposition-dependent ones, and transforms raw pitch-class information (reversibly) into a set of music-theoretically digestible features such as chromatic concentration, diatonicity, octatonicity, and whole-tone balance.</p>
<p>I propose a rough analytical methodology of first identifying significant DFT components, then plotting harmonic entities from the music in circular or toroidal <i>phase spaces</i>. Paths in such spaces are referrable to familiar pcset-theory concepts such as subset relations, common tones, and transpositional combination.</p>
<p>The paper features two analytical sections. First, I show how charting <i>diatonicity</i>, the fifth DFT Fourier component, can simplify scale-theoretic analysis, commenting upon the subset problem and scale-network wormholes in Dmitri Tymoczko’s analysis of Debussy’s “Le vent dans la plaine” and also upon octanicism in Stravinsky. Second, I demonstrate techniques of transpositional combination and chromatic/diatonic dialectic in Feldman’s “Palais de Mari.” The latter analysis emphasizes the double nature of paths in phase space as motions from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> or expressions of <i>B</i>-in-the-context-of-<i>A</i>.</p>
