<p>How, and to what extent, is an epistemic music historiography informed by
the archival textures of colonial musical pasts? What are the ethical
implications involved for the future of a musicology that is increasingly
informed by postcolonial readings of the past and present? Anthropologist Ann
Stoler’s concept of the “Archival Grain” (2009) is a potentially rich starting
point for a timely discussion; her differentiation between “granular” and
“seamless” textures highlights the conflicting discourses of colonial
knowledge, and a possible “overcommitment to Foucault’s vocabulary.” Likewise,
the multifaceted intricacies of archival textures—and the scholarly ethics of
and around knowledge construction—suggest a topical intervention from
historical musicologists and music theorists alike. Indeed, while existing
historical narratives have laid the groundwork for a rich engagement with
theories of empire and postcolonial thought (van der Linden 2013; Radano and
Olaniyan 2016), colonial and musicological discourses of knowledge—notably in
their transhistorical dynamics—remain little if at all examined. </p>

<p>This session aims, then, to initiate a new discussion through which to
explore the scope for an epistemic ethics. Our proposed discussion speaks,
moreover, for an emergent musicology that is not only globally attuned, but
also geographically sensitive to localities, archives, materials (including
scores), and the source languages entailed. The six position statements will
include: “Between ‘No Longer’ and ‘Not Yet’” (Cohen); “Archival Air” (Davies);
“Scandinavia through a Postcolonial Lens” (Grimley); “Epistemic Silence”
(Johnson-Williams); “Postcolonial Principles for Distributive Justice” (Kok);
and “Code History: Post/colonial Archives” (Liao). These statements, which
will have been posted online before the session, will then lead to a general
discussion among and between the discussants and audience.</p>

<p>Collectively, our discussants will explore two key concerns. The first
addresses the ways in which “materials past” relate and/or do not relate to
“narratives present,” and their attendant implications for music
historiography. Here, we will work further along the “archival grain,” giving
consideration not only to records of colonial in/difference, but also to how
discourses of colonial knowledge, oft-fraught with competing agencies, are
reflected and/or not reflected in discourses of musicological knowledge. In
assessing the in/congruence between “materials past” and “narratives present,”
our discussants will bring into focus postcolonial conditions of
“historiographic operation” (de Certeau 1988): archival and other
institutional policies that may reify or shift, reveal or obscure the
“knowledge” of sites, events, and other registers of musical practice
associated, but not always synonymous with, imperial aspirations. The second
concern has to do with the practical benefits and challenges of developing an
epistemic ethics in and for music historiography. If, according to Stoler,
more emphasis in the academy has been placed on “the procedures and activities
on which certain ways of knowing rely” (rather than on so-called theories of
knowledge)—how might these particularities influence the writing of music
histories that address the complexities and legacies of empire? In tackling
these concerns, we will thus enact a mediated discussion of epistemic ethics,
one reflective of multiple politics of knowledge, colonial and musicological,
past and present. </p>
