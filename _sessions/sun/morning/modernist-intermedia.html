<p class="abs-title">Forging Cubist Music: Igor Stravinsky’s Encounter with Pablo Picasso and the <em>Etude pour Pianola</em> (1917)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Christoforidis (University of Melbourne)</p>

<p>The creative dialogue between two of the twentieth century’s iconic figures, Pablo Picasso and Igor Stravinsky, began in Italy in 1917. This meeting between the two artists had been keenly anticipated, both by Serge Diaghilev and the Chilean heiress Eugenia Errazuriz, who encouraged them to work together on a Ballets Russes production. While their final collaboration, in the form of <em>Pulcinella</em> (1920), has received considerable scholarly attention, the immediate outcomes of this encounter (drawn from the Picasso and Stravinsky sketchbooks) suggest a number of early creative analogues between the artists. The impact of this first meeting on Stravinsky’s music will be traced primarily through his compositional process in the <em>Etude pour Pianola</em> of 1917 (later subtitled “Madrid”), in which he manipulated a series of musical gestures associated with Spain to suggest the vibrant cacophony of the Madrid streetscapes.</p>
<p>In this paper I argue that Stravinsky’s <em>Etude</em> was born of the desire to adapt the techniques employed by Pablo Picasso and his circle. The work embodies certain concepts of simultaneity and juxtaposition that were consciously drawn from cubist and collage techniques, and whose early manifestations can be traced to the sketch materials for the work. The visual aspect of the final score and Stravinsky’s hand-written drafts also highlight the game of linear intersections and a cultivated non-alignment of motives, techniques that evolved during the composition of the work. In the process, Stravinsky created a modernist reconfiguration of musical evocations of Spain and the Mediterranean. However, rather than adapting Spanish folk or popular music sources, Stravinsky drew primarily on materials from the <em>espagnolades</em> (or musical impressions of Spain) of his Russian and Franco-Spanish musical peers. The musical sources drawn from these scores were radically reconfigured by Stravinsky to create a distilled musical tableau, one that transcends the crowd scenes of his earlier Ballets Russes works and demonstrates clear parallels with Picasso’s visual techniques and contemporary trends in the figurative arts.</p>

<p>Operating in Germany’s most influential hub of modernism in the 1920s, the artists at the Bauhaus aspired to transcend all art forms. Many of them were professionally trained musicians and remained avidly engaged with music throughout their careers. While art historians have long acknowledged the importance of music for the Bauhaus’s inter-medial agenda, music scholars have yet to scrutinize how their endeavors mirrored musical and music theoretical discourses of their time.</p>
<p>Seeking inspiration not only in the organization of specific musical compositions, but also in notational practices for music, some of these artists—notably Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Henrik Neugeboren—translated musical works for visual consumption. This paper focuses on artistic visualizations of works by Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Sebastian Bach by these three artists. These visualizations repurpose the basic notational elements of the point and the line, thereby inscribing musical and aesthetic connotations in these graphical elements. My analysis of these visualizations reveals the thoroughly cognitive approach that the artists adopted, presenting the music from the listener’s perspective. Moreover, the artists’ notational choices—and in particular the rendition of melody as a linear Gestalt—align with contemporaneous research in music cognition, notably Christian von Ehrenfels’s studies “On Gestalt-qualities” (1890 and 1920). Art historian Régine Bonnefoit (2011) has speculated that such a conception of melody was transmitted to the artists at the Bauhaus through Ernst Kurth’s 1917 treatise <em>Foundations of Linear Counterpoint: Bach’s Linear Polyphony</em>, rather than directly from Ehrenfels’s work. I expand on her speculation by analyzing how the images not only reflect a linear and Gestalt-theoretical view on melody, but how they moreover enact Kurth’s understanding of counterpoint as an interweaving of multiple linear-melodic strands. As such, these artistic renditions not only visualize an analytical reading of the music in question, but they also provide a visually accessible account of Kurth’s music theoretical framework.</p>
