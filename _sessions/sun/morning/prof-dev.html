<h2>Description</h2>

<h4 id="publication">Writing for Publication</h4>

<p>The process of writing, submitting, revising, and finally publishing an article can be mysterious and intimidating, especially to recent graduates who are accustomed to relying on an advisor for guidance. This short session provides practical tips and ideas for the various stages of preparing an article.</p>

<p>The session consists of three presentations on the following topics: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Michael Klein (Temple University): How to turn a conference presentation into an article</li>
  <li>David Huron (Ohio State University): How to revise and resubmit a rejected article</li>
  <li>Nadine Hubbs (University of Michigan): Publishing outside of mainstream music theory journals (e.g., self-publications, online services, interdisciplinary publications, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the three twenty-minute presentations will be followed by a ten-minute open discussion. Anticipated topics include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the differences between effective conference presentations and journal articles?</li>
  <li>How should one respond to negative feedback or even caustic remarks by reviewers?</li>
  <li>How should one document the revisions made when resubmitting the paper?</li>
  <li>What are some of the most popular resources for on-line and self-publication?</li>
  <li>Is publishing in non-juried journals a good way to advance one’s career?</li>
</ul>
