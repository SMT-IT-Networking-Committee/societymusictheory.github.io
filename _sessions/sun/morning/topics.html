<p class="abs-title">Zerlina on the Metrical Stage: The Dramatic Fluidity of Metrical Consonances</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nathaniel Mitchell (Princeton University)</p>

<p>The character of Zerlina from Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i> pairs a high degree of social fluidity on the one hand with an equally high degree of metrical consistency on the other. By returning again and again in various dramatic contexts to music written in 6/8, Zerlina provides a window into the fluid properties of consonant metrical states and the dramatic potential inherent in their manipulation. This paper develops an analytical technique to track these shifts in metrical configuration. Drawing on Danuta Mirka’s brief sketch for a “theory of metrical consonance,” I analyze metrical states as fluid constellations of properties – including metrical depth, density, and weight – that are capable of undergoing radical redefinitions as a work unfolds. I also take preliminary steps toward viewing metrical hierarchies as weighted in unique ways by different strands of the musical texture. Returning to <i>Don Giovanni</i>, I read Zerlina’s transformation of 6/8 over the course of the opera as an expression of her perceived social mobility that nonetheless remains firmly situated within a decidedly peasant orientation. </p>

<p>Kofi Agawu (2009) states that “at the root of [Stravinsky’s] aesthetic lies a desire to creatively violate commonplaces or figures burdened with historical or conventional meaning.” My paper focuses on what I call “distorted topics” – certain dance topics whose characteristic rhythmic or metric identities have been altered – in the first movement of Stravinsky’s <i>Violin Concerto</i> (1931). The analytical approach I utilize for these rhythmic and metric deformations draws on Pieter C. van den Toorn’s discussions of displacement (2004), and ideas from Lynne Rogers’ work on dissociation (1995). Additionally, I use approaches to topic theory developed by authors such as Wye Jamison Allanbrook (1983), Robert S. Hatten (1994/2004), Raymond Monelle (2006), and Agawu (2009), to examine some of the musical, socio-historical, and expressive meanings associated with these topics. Given that the latter group of scholars tends to focus on music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, I adapt their ideas to this twentieth-century work using Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of defamiliarization, to demonstrate how listeners might interpret Stravinsky’s manipulations of such figures.</p>
<p>As the musical landscape changed in the early twentieth century, some of the expressive meanings associated with topics also shifted – a notion reflected in Stravinsky’s distortion of their common rhythmic and metric characteristics. Explicating the tension between each topic’s musical, socio-historical, and expressive associations, and the ways in which each figure is altered in the music itself, is a potentially valuable approach to interpreting possible expressive meanings in Stravinsky’s <i>Violin Concerto</i>.</p>
