<p class="abs-title">Reassessing Russian Comic Opera: Singers, Aesthetics, and Success in Eighteenth-Century St. Petersburg</p>
<p class="abs-author">Elise Bonner (Columbia University)</p>

<p>By the end of the eighteenth century, Russian operagoers from St. Petersburg to Siberia were eagerly attending performances of Mikhail Sokolovsky’s <em>Mel’nik— koldun, obman’shchik i svat</em> (<em>The Miller who was a Wizard, Cheat, and Matchmaker</em>, 1779). Yet this widespread enthusiasm confounded the lettered elites. After disparaging the comic opera’s coarse libretto and folksy music, they struggled to explain its success in the capital. One observer attributed it success to the comic bass in the title role, writing, “Anton Krutitsky’s skillful performance was the reason why this extremely weak opera, filled as it was with many infelicities, was performed around twenty-seven times, and for the most part at the request of the parterre.” Though scholars have long dismissed early Russian opera singers as having little musical talent or influence, the critic’s claim finds support in the box office, salaries, and heavy purses that fans addressed to the miller and hurled onto the stage.</p>
<p>As a disfigured orphan performing in a decrepit manège, Krutitsky had little chance of avoiding destitution, much less of becoming the first star of Russian opera. Yet he managed to attract a devoted following, with his supple, pleasing voice and distinctive natural acting style, and contributed to the early success of the genre. In this paper, I argue that although spectators may have centered their praise on Krutitsky’s performances, their comments also show that specific musical and dramatic techniques bolstered its success as well. Both <em>Mel’nik</em> and Vasily Pashkevich’s <em>Skupo</em>y (<em>The Miser</em>, 1781) received exceptional praise for one solo scene complex. In both, through-composed music and continuous dramatic action may have helped Krutitsky foster the illusion of spontaneity and arouse the audience’s sympathy, which played to the singer’s talent of seeming verisimilar and familiar. The reception of these operas also suggests that to spectators, Russian comic opera was neither a mere imitation of opéra comique nor a concerted attempt to create a national idiom, as scholars have assumed. Instead, it succeeded as a cosmopolitan genre, one inspired by the principle of dramatic mimesis and an aesthetics of naturalism and simplicity.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Newspaper to Opera: <em>Orango</em>, Topicality, and the Documentary Aesthetic</p>
<p class="abs-author">Marina Frolova-Walker (University of Cambridge)</p>

<p>The recently discovered unfinished opera <em>Orango</em> (1932) has become a major sensation in Shostakovich studies: after the 2011 world premiere in Los Angeles, it was shown in London, Moscow, Perm, and Prague, and released on CD. The only scholarly commentary on the opera comes from the individuals who made the revival possible: Olga Digonskaya, who located the draft in 2004, and Gerard McBurney, who orchestrated the surviving Prologue. They both tried to elucidate the significance of the central character as a half-man, half-ape, and the roots of this conceit in scientific experiments of the time. However, no one has yet convincingly explained why the work was billed as a “pamphlet opera,” or why the project was suddenly dropped (reviewers of the popular press asserted groundlessly that this was due to the detection of covert anti-Stalinism).</p>
<p>A careful examination of the libretto, mainly written by Alexei Tolstoy, together with Tolstoy’s political novels of the time and the contemporary Russian and European press, allows us to propose radically new answers to these questions. The pamphlet opera proves to be rooted in the dramatic events of May 1932, when Doumer, the French president, was assassinated by Paul Gourgouloff, a Russian émigré, resulting in a foreign relations crisis for the USSR. This forgotten episode from the uneasy calm of the inter-war years occurred just before <em>Orango</em> was conceived, and biographical details of French leaders such as Clemenceau and Tardieu found their way straight from the broadsheet pages into the libretto. The most striking resemblance, however, can be found between the press portrayal of the real Gorgouloff and the opera’s Orango.</p>
<p>This kind of ephemeral topicality proved unsuitable for opera, and the project was abandoned as soon as the real-world political crisis was resolved. However, the concept of a news-based musical work, a product of the “documentary aesthetic” of the 1920s and ’30s modernism, continued to play a part long after its apparent shelf life, thanks to the Soviet penchant for up-to-date slogans. In this context I will consider other Shostakovich works that came off the pages of the press.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Shostakovich’s <em>Lady Macbeth from the Mtzensk District</em>:>The Finale of Scene Four as Opera Buffa Parody</p>
<p class="abs-author">Esti Sheinberg (University of Nebraska–Lincoln)</p>

<p>Shostakovich’s second opera, <em>Lady Macbeth from the Mtzensk District</em> (1932) shows the influence of the Russian Formalists’ theories of parody (Hutcheon, 1985; Sheinberg, 2000). Further inspiration in this direction was provided in his discussions with his closest friend, the musicologist, critic, and philologist Ivan Sollertinsky and by Mikhail Bakhtin’s ideas of the carnival and of plurivocality (Sheinberg, 2000; Fairclough, 2006).</p>
<p>Shostakovich referred to <em>Lady Macbeth</em> as a “tragedy-satire” (Sollertinsky, 1932; Fay, 2000), stating that the work is about the personal tragedy of a woman who is maltreated by her society, which is satirized in the opera. This categorization, however, calls for an inquiry beyond the composer’s account.</p>
<p>While Shostakovich’s literary source was Leskov’s nineteenth century novella, his stylistic approach reflected that of Russian literary theoreticians, who endorsed parody as the primary technique of creative work. Contemporary Russian music reflects similar ideas: the neo-classical works of Prokofiev and Stravinsky are renowned parodies. Shostakovich, however, applied parody techniques rather indirectly, reaching beyond surface gestures into deep structural principles.</p>
<p>These principles gain a new insight thanks to Wye Jamison Allanbrook’s last book, <em>The Secular Commedia</em>, posthumously edited by Mary Ann Smart and Richard Taruskin. Analyzing the ways in which opera buffa provided a structural source for late eighteenth century instrumental forms, Allanbrook’s description of Mozart’s symphonies as a kaleidoscopic collage of musical topics, inspired by the Commedia dell’ arte, seems perfectly fitted for the way Shostakovich composed his opera.</p>
<p>It is unclear if Sollertinsky, Shostakovich’s main source of theoretical erudition, was familiar with Diderot’s <em>Le Neveu de Rameau</em>, which served as a starting point for Allanbrook’s discussion. However, the Commedia’s characters, gestures, and scripts were immensely popular and often portrayed in early twentieth century Russian music, ballet, theater, poetry, and literature.</p>
<p>My presentation provides a theoretical context and analysis of the Second act’s finale of <em>Lady Macbeth from the Mtzensk District</em>, revealing its parodying techniques and eighteenth century opera buffa’s finale structure. It then explains the bizarre collage of topics—folk songs, religious rituals, and a quasi-atonal passacaglia—in their unsettling mixture of cruelty and pity, the satirical burlesque and the grotesque.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Opera as Policy during the Reign of Nicholas I: The First Decade (1825–35)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniil Zavlunov (Stetson University)</p>

<p>Whether one views Mikhail Glinka’s <em>A Life for the Tsar</em> (1836) as the origins of Russian opera or, less grandiosely, situates this work as a watershed in the longer history of opera in Russia, one has to come to terms with its immediate contexts. Whereas recent scholarship has done much to clarify the musical contexts, it has done remarkably little to explain the socio-political and cultural forces that determined the direction of opera at this juncture in Russian history. Concentrating on these forces upends the standard narrative. Rather than view Glinka’s opera as a starting (or turning) point, it might more profitably be understood as a manifestation and culmination of a highly successful decade (1825–35) of experimentation with cultural policies aimed at transforming Russia’s musical institutions. Our knowledge of that transformation remains one of the biggest lacunae in scholarship on Russian music, with two components in particular missing from its historiography: the history of institutions, and the individuals who pulled the levers of power. Drawing on newly uncovered documents in the Imperial Collection of the Russian Historical State Archive, this paper surveys the rapidly evolving policies on the governance of the Imperial Theaters system, changes to the institution of theater censorship, swift updating of the repertories and professionalization of the musical establishment in Russia (including the invitation of the Italian opera troupe, and creation of the Russian one), and construction of new performance spaces—all implemented and micromanaged, with extraordinary short- and long-term ramifications, by the monarch of Russia, Nicholas I.</p>
