<p class="abs-title">A Feast for the Senses: The Use of Culinary Rhetoric in Music Books of the Seventeenth Century</p>
<p class="abs-author">Susan Lewis (University of Victoria)</p>

<p>Food and music enjoy a close relationship that is bound in the sensory experience. The sensory connections are clearly evident in the use of culinary rhetoric in music books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Culinary rhetoric can be found in works from the decades around 1600, such as Orazio Vecchi’s <em>Il convito musicale</em> (1597) and Johann Hermann Schein’s <em>Banchetto musicale</em> (1617), and remained strong at the end of the seventeenth century with Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber’s <em>Mensa sonora</em> (1680), Henry Playford’s six-volume series <em>A</em></p>
<p><em>Musical Banquet</em> (1687–92), and the keyboard anthology <em>A Ladys Entertainment or Banquet of Music</em> (1708). The banquet metaphor aptly suited music anthologies; in the preface to <em>A Musicall Banquet</em> (1610), an anthology of twenty ayres in English, French, Spanish, and Italian, Robert Dowland compared his work as a compiler to that of “a careful Confectionary” preparing a “Banquet for all tastes.” The use of culinary rhetoric coincided with a renewed interest in style and eloquence that privileged food metaphors, both as structuring devices and descriptive ones. Food imagery permeated the book world. The noted extravagance of Francis I formed the allegorical basis for Rabelais’s two novels, <em>Pantagruel</em> (1533) and <em>Gargantua</em> (1535). Marriage accounts such as <em>The Bachelor’s Banquet</em> (1603) offer us a rich look at middle-class Elizabethan values and consumerism. Vittorico Lancellotti shared the elaborate feasting rituals of Roman banquets with European audiences in <em>Lo scalco prattico</em> (1627).</p>
<p>In this paper, I situate the use of culinary rhetoric in music books within the framework of extravagance, variety, abundance, and wonderment that characterized aesthetic values of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Drawing on examples from England, Italy, and Germany, my presentation assesses the role of culinary rhetoric in relation to the distribution and circulation of music. I argue that culinary rhetoric shaped interactions between composers, compilers, publishers, performers, and book collectors, and informed patterns of music consumerism well into the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Banquets, Bacchanals, and the Birth of Opera: The Drinking Song in Politian’s <em>Orfeo</em></p>

<p>A pivotal operatic experiment conducted by members of Ficino’s Neo-Platonic academy was Politian’s <em>Orfeo</em>, premiered with improvised music during a banquet given in Mantua on Mardi Gras, 1480. Nino Pirrotta, Karol Berger, and Gary Tomlinson (among others) have assessed the significance of Politian’s <em>Orfeo</em> in opera’s early history. Their contributions paved the way to the present study, which focuses on one aspect of <em>Orfeo</em> that has received insufficient attention: the representation of female frenzy in the drinking song and its relationship to the banquet framing its performance. The banquet, offered by Cardinal Gonzaga, was a convivial ritual of transition from feasting (Carnival) to fasting (Lent). Like other Renaissance banquets it was a multi-media event designed “to satisfy all the senses,” as Rossetti writes in his banquet-art manual, <em>Dello scalco</em> (1584). The female drinking song at the end of <em>Orfeo</em> signaled the “last call” before Lent. The piece was introduced by a Bacchant holding the severed head of Orpheus. This image would have recalled the iconography of Judith, which Donatello represented in the act of beheading king Holofernes. Adrian Randolph has defined this sculpture as “the most important political statue in fifteenth-century Florence” and as “an allegory of justice.” The drinking song, which was both sung and danced, was possibly inspired by tarantism: a female trance-induced dance acknowledged by Ficino as a relic of Bacchanal frenzy, often construed as a form of neurotic disorder. The pattern of accents in the text fits in fact a typical tarantella rhythmic pattern. As anthropologist De Martino wrote about tarantism, “the harsh social pressure exercised on the female world in an androcratic type of society leads to the return of the repressed in the form of ciphered neurotic symptoms incompatible with any cultural order.” Politian’s <em>Orfeo</em> not only problematizes order and justice, but also anticipates what the Alterati academy would later theorize in understudied speeches given at their banquets at the time of the first Florentine operas about the Orpheus myth: drama with music can cause catharsis by releasing pain, libido, or anger in an unrepressed but structured ritual.</p>
