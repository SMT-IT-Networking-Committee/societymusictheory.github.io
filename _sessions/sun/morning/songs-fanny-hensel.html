<p>This special-format joint session includes ten “lightning talks” on the
songs of Fanny Hensel. There has been a wealth of scholarship on Hensel in
recent years, but most of it is historical or editorial; detailed discussion
of her music is rare. This session places Hensel’s music front and center,
focusing on the genre that she said “suits me best.” The presenters cover a
wide variety of topics, yet they are united in the conviction that the best
way to appreciate Hensel’s importance in the history of the nineteenth-century
lied is to thoroughly examine what she wrote, in its many contexts.</p>

<p>The presentations are organized into four sections, each of which
highlights a different facet of Hensel’s lied aesthetic: her fascination with
songs about nature and travel, her settings of English verse, her tonal
ingenuity, and her sensitivity to poetic form. Each presenter concentrates on
one song and places it within a larger argument about Hensel’s music.</p>
