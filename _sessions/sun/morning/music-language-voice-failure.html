<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>In the 2015 <em>JAMS</em> Colloquy “Why Voice Now?”, the contributors describe the “pure terrain of the thing we call voice,” revealed only when we “strip away speech, poetry, phonetics, morphology—all of language, in short.” Our purpose in this session is to complement the colloquy’s broad theoretical discussion by presenting case studies of vocal practices in late twentieth century European modernism that put the voice into circulation within the boundaries that the colloquy describes. More precisely, each paper examines musical works that expose the voice in the moment when its sound, place, or language fail. We are especially interested in tracing the two main positions that were delineated during the disagreement between Karlheinz Stockhausen and Luigi Nono regarding the proper place of voice and language in postwar modernist composition: either a faith in sound’s communicative power over and beyond that of language, or a mourning of language’s lost communicative power. For both strategies, language’s promise of communicative efficacy is held forth, only to fail and fall back to what is construed as the more directly communicative power of voice.</p>

<p>Histories of the Darmstadt School often trace its fracture to the 1958 disagreement between Karlheinz Stockhausen and Luigi Nono over the use of text within modernist music. This narrative typically positions Theodor Adorno’s contemporaneous Darmstadt lectures as largely unrelated attacks on postwar serialism’s unchecked rationalization. Yet scholars who frame these disputes as separate skirmishes miss that both the Stockhausen-Nono dispute and Adorno’s critiques deal less with language and music as such than the possibility of a musical immediacy that short-circuits language’s mediation. In this paper, I place the debate between Stockhausen and Nono into dialogue with Theodor Adorno’s lecture “The Aging of the New Music,” to demonstrate that all three were primarily concerned with music’s potential for immediate communication, unhindered by the distanced referentiality of language.</p>
<p>I begin by arguing that Stockhausen’s and Nono’s vocal disagreement masks their more fundamental agreement on the power of sound to effect immediate communication beyond language. Stockhausen’s criticism of <em>Il canto sospeso</em> read within the context of his studies with Werner Meyer-Eppler shows that he was motivated by the information-theoretical conceit of the direct power of nonlingual sound. For Meyer-Eppler, as for Stockhausen, a word’s <em>sounds</em> carried the affective charge formerly assigned to its meaning. Similarly, Nono’s strident rebuttal to Stockhausen’s criticism claimed that a word’s sound immediately impresses the affect of the word’s meaning. Nono critically misreads Maurice Merleau-Ponty to argue that the affect of a particular word inheres within its phonemes themselves, thereby getting around the problem of language’s second-order referentiality.</p>
<p>Having shown how their views converge, I turn to Adorno’s criticism of postwar serialism’s “schematic organization.” His Darmstadt lecture “The Aging of the New Music” specifically targeted their shared utopic hope for immediacy. For Adorno, their faith in the possibility of immediate sound was the deluded search for the “pure voice of Being” or the Adamic “pure name,” a language whose immediacy guaranteed its communicative efficacy. Adorno’s critique of serialism was thus a critique of Stockhausen and Nono’s hope to conjure a primordial, immediate “voice” in the void of language’s failure.</p>

<p>Björn Heile, among others, wrote of the challenge modernism presents for opera, a form wedded historically to “realism, illusionism, and representation.” Even operas accepted into the modern canon such as <em>Wozzeck</em> bracket off the medium of representation to blur diegetic song and operatic song, as discussed by Cone and Kivy. I argue in this paper that the most successful contemporary operatic and vocal works confront the problem of representation directly, as part of the larger crisis of language that characterizes the modernist project as a whole. I thus examine four post-1980 vocal works in which language can be said to collapse as a determinite and stable site of meaning, replaced by music’s radically particular modes of communication and expression. Each example foregrounds the failure of language in a different way, and presents—rather than re-presents—a voice whose very opacity demands our engagement.</p>
<p>The majority of Claude Vivier’s <em>Prologue pour Marco Polo</em> (1981) is set to Vivier’s own <em>langue inventée</em> which stands in not for a specific foreign tongue but for the complete opacity of the “other” in any incarnation. By contrast, Salvatore Sciarrino<em>’s Luci mie traditrici</em> (1996) operates as an allegory of a world where language kills. Its hushed murmers and use of <em>sillabazione scivolata</em> privilege what is irreducible to nonmusic expression, and thus beyond the dangers of representation. The third of Gerard Grisey’s <em>Quatre chants pour franchir le seuil</em> for soprano and orchestra (1997–98) stages the “Death of the Voice” itself as temporal canons remove elements of sense to leave only “echoing drifts” behind. The setting of David Lang’s <em>The Difficulty of Crossing a Field</em> (2001) combines with Mac Wellman’s circular, nonsensical libretto to supplant verbal sense with the pure material immediacy of the language’s sounds and rhythms.</p>
<p>Each work is rooted in a specific historical context, yet points toward a universal event: the moment at which representation breaks down, and what is sayable gives way to what is irreducible to nonmusical expression. In doing so they invoke an ethics of the particular that integrates gesture, metaphor, and the complex, intersubjective power of music as social practice.</p>
