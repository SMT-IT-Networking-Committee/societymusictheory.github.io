<p class="abs-title">Journey to the Land of the Blues: Encounters and Exchange in British and European Visits to Chicago, 1957–60</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lawrence Davies (King’s College London)</p>

<p>In the late 1950s, a number of British, French, and Belgian blues enthusiasts visited the United States. Gravitating to Chicago, visitors such as Bruynoghe (1957–58), Demêtre and Chauvard (1959), Adins (1959–60), and Oliver (1960) sought to obtain discographical and biographical information about blues musicians, while immersing themselves in African American life. These visits have attracted little academic scrutiny; their participants are thought to have been motivated by the objectives of the jazz “revival” of the 1940s and the folk “revival” of the 1960s, when white enthusiasts sought to discover, document, and preserve what they heard to be a unique, exotic, and disappearing musical culture (Hamilton 2008; O’Connell 2015).</p>
<p>Alternatively, these encounters can be understood in the context of increasing transatlantic musical <em>exchange</em> during the 1950s, when both African American and British blues musicians first began to travel internationally in significant numbers. Drawing on the notion of fieldwork as “visiting” (Titon 2004), I show how hosts on both sides of the Atlantic were anxious to maintain this climate of exchange, absorbing their visitors into existing networks of musical and social interaction. Complicating the division between “insider” and “outsider” common to existing representations of African American culture at this time (e.g. Ramsey, Smith, et al. 1939; Blesh 1943), visitors’ accounts evoked African American musicians’ professional thoughts and concerns, moments of interracial affinity, and the conciliatory power of blues music in a way that is surprising—even unique— for this period (cf. Jones 1963). Finally, I suggest the need for a re-examination of early British and European blues appreciation with an eye not only to how enthusiasts (mis)represented African American expressive culture, but also to how they <em>participated</em> in it.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Chicago Blues in the Studio: Bill Putnam, Muddy Waters, “Still a Fool,” and the Chess Sound</p>

<p>Two related Muddy Waters recordings provide insight into how recording technology, studio techniques, and the input of the producer and engineer alter musical meaning. Produced by Leonard Chess, “Rolling Stone” (1950) and “Still a Fool” (1951) share the same riff and tune, and are derived from “Catfish Blues.” Recorded during the years Chess used Bill Putnam’s Universal Audio studio, both reflect how Putnam’s do-it-yourself approach to audio production and creative decisions made by producer resulted in innovative and now-standard recording techniques at the intersection of Chicago blues and rock ’n’ roll. Reverberation and echo mimicked the sound of live performance. The implications are far ranging. First, rather than write separate histories of blues, rhythm and blues, and 1950s rock ’n’ roll, we should consider how various genres of black music crosspollinated each other. Second, modeled after and seeking to capitalize on the success of Jackie Brenston &amp; His Delta Cats’s “Rocket 88” (Chess 1458), Waters and Chess recreated the overall sound of that recording in subsequent blues recordings. Finally, as white listeners encountered black music during the 1950s, reverb gave them the sense of being in a black nightclub or dancehall. Thus, these two recordings have import and serve as a metonym for what was happening in an industrial United States in the late 1940s and ’50s at the dawn of the Civil Rights era. They provide an added dimension and nuance in understanding how in the late 1950s and ’60s white American youth experienced black Chicago blues, rhythm and blues, and rock ’n’ roll initially not through live performances, but through sound recordings designed to give the ambience of the live black blues or rhythm and blues club, thereby providing white youth a safe glimpse of black musical culture—via recordings in which black music was mediated by white producers and engineers during the era when the studio emerged as instrument.</p>
