<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>The transition from silent to synchronized sound film radically changed the technology, practices, and aesthetics of filmmaking within a few short years. The advent of synchronized dialogue fundamentally transformed music’s role in cinema from a live experience to one mediated by technology. It also provided possibilities for heightening realism in film. Scholars (Crafton 1999, Gomery 2005, Slowik 2014) have primarily limited their focus to the transition to sound in Hollywood; as a result, international films are often measured against an aesthetic standard that was not universal. However, studying the early sound films of France, developed in a cosmopolitan industry that included émigrés from across the European continent, reveals a wider array of possibilities for the role music played in sound film before Hollywood practices became codified.</p>
<p>This session explores the musical response in France to synchronized sound, with a focus on the issue of realism. For some filmmakers, the realist potential of sound film was its most attractive feature. But others wanted cinematic storytelling to remain more abstract, as it had been in silent film, relying on music (more artificial than spoken dialogue) to help define a “poetic,” “fantastical” cinema. The papers in this session reveal the significance, for composers and directors alike, of grappling with realism in sound film, and music’s role in defining such an aesthetic. This examination of early 1930s French film music practices reveals the unique interplay of technology, musical modernism, and the avant-garde prompted by the transition to synchronized sound in France.</p>

<p>Surrealist cinema flourished in France in the late 1920s, but following the widespread adoption of synchronized sound in Europe in 1929, its future was uncertain. The anti-musical stance of many Surrealists (particularly André Breton), who believed that the abstract nature of music violated surrealism’s philosophical, literary, and aesthetic principles, made the very concept of surrealist sound film problematic. With the heightened realism of synchronized dialogue and the presence of a recorded musical soundtrack, music’s role in the new audiovisual form threatened to destabilize the dream logic that surrealist filmmakers had established in silent cinema. But the new technology also offered an opportunity for composers and directors to renegotiate music’s role in surrealist film.</p>
<p>I argue that music became a crucial tool in early conceptions of surrealist audiovisual cinema, when sound film’s potential energy was at its height. I examine two of France’s first sound films—Luis Buñuel’s <em>L’Age d’or</em> (1930) and Jean Cocteau’s <em>Le Sang d’un poète</em> (1930)—both of which favored an audiovisual aesthetic relying heavily on surrealist principles. These controversial films deliberately avoided realism, employing music as a tool for audiovisual juxtaposition, pastiche, and shock value. For <em>Le Sang d’un poète</em> composer Georges Auric wrote a score that Cocteau proceeded to cut up and reorder, an experiment in “accidental synchronization” and a means of avoiding explicit musical signification.</p>
<p>Buñuel incorporated preexisting classical works—by composers including Mozart, Beethoven, and Wagner—into <em>L’Age d’or</em> and juxtaposed them with absurd, even offensive, images. Though their approaches to the soundtrack differed, both directors experimented with film rhythm and pacing, with contrasting synchronism and audiovisual counterpoint, and with violating expectations of audiovisual unity. This brief but productive intersection between avant-garde cinematic and musical modernist practices at a critical juncture in France’s nascent sound film production influenced subsequent French cinematic experiments, particularly those of the Nouvelle Vague. My analysis of the music in <em>L’Age d’or</em> and <em>Le Sang d’un poète</em> theorizes the audiovisual elements constituting surrealist sound film; it also highlights the inherently surreal characteristics of the sound film medium itself, characteristics that most mainstream filmmakers would later try their hardest to erase.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Realism in Theory and Practice in Early French Sound Film: The Case of <em>Rapt</em> (1934)</p>

<p>In 1930, the French-Romanian surrealist poet and screenwriter Benjamin Fondane, lamenting the arrival of sound film, proposed a distinctly anti-realist vision for the new soundtracks: “<em>Noises and dialogue that are exaggerated, deformed, as fake as possible:</em> this is the only use of speech or sound that is likely to maintain all of the benefits of silent film, while altering its form and enriching its hypnotic power.” Meanwhile, composer Arthur Honegger embraced sound film’s potential to communicate to listeners the precise meaning of abstract instrumental music— its “reality”—through close coordination between image and sound. In practice, no one version of sonic “reality” could possibly emerge from the soundtracks of Honegger’s thirty-two feature-length sound film projects, due in part to the variety of sounds employed: music, dialogue, sound effects. The divergent visions of Fondane and Honegger collided in 1934 in <em>Rapt</em>, the first sound film project for Fondane, Honegger, Honegger’s co-composer Arthur Hoérée, and the experimental director Dimitri Kirsanoff (best known for the brutally realist 1925 silent film <em>Ménilmontant</em>).</p>
<p>Characteristically, Honegger declared that in <em>Rapt</em> he and Hoérée eschewed “descriptive harmonies” in favor of “classic forms” such as fugue to underscore a chase scene between a dog and a goat. Thus, “music would retain its autonomy so that it never encroaches upon the domain of the screen or vice versa.” Nonetheless, the scenes I discuss reveal that Honegger’s instrumental and Hoérée’s electroacoustic compositions blur the line between music and sound effect. The soundtrack’s complex interaction with the film’s images also undermines Honegger’s theoretical assumption that what images mean is concrete whereas what music means is abstract. In <em>Rapt</em>, Honegger and Hoérée successfully harnessed the concrete meaning of visual imagery such as rushing water and menacing storm clouds to define music’s “reality.” At the same time, as Fondane had predicted, the unstable relationship of film’s visual storytelling to one distinct version of reality provided the opportunity for music, image, and dialogue to work together in <em>Rapt</em> to collectively communicate not just realism, but insight, to the audience of this new, “hypnotic” technology.</p>
