<p class="abs-title">Written and Oral Practice in Late-Quattrocento Neapolitan Song</p>
<p class="abs-author">Elizabeth Elmi (Indiana University)</p>

<p>This paper investigates the complex relationship between oral and written practice in the song tradition of late-Quattrocento Naples by evaluating the contents of several musical manuscripts. The improvised tradition of sung poetry attained paramount importance in Aragonese-ruled Naples and permeated its diverse community of humanists, poet-improvisers, chapel singers, and composers. As an unwritten practice, the specific characteristics of this tradition have been lost; yet written sources of music and poetry from the period provide crucial information about how these performances might have sounded. Indeed, surviving examples of Neapolitan song in late fifteenth-century sources attest to a transitional process of transmission and preservation between oral performance and written record.</p>
<p>The sources for this study include four manuscripts, which Allan Atlas and others have identified as central to the musical tradition of Aragonese Naples: two sacred and secular anthologies (Montecassino N871 and Perugia 431); and two French-style chansonniers (Seville 5-I-43+Paris N.A.F. 4379 and Bologna Q16). In each of these manuscripts, the transmission of Neapolitan song seems incidental to the composition of the larger collection, and that repertoire’s importance has been consequently underestimated in earlier scholarship. Taken together, however, the four sources preserve a significant body of over a hundred Italian-texted songs whose musical, textual, and material qualities show evidence of their connection to oral culture.</p>
<p>This paper centers on two case studies of <em>strambotti</em> drawn from these manuscripts, which attest to different stages in the transformative process from oral to written practice. The first, “Sera nel core mio doglia e tormento,” exemplifies a song that has moved away from orality and has instead been diffused and concretized in the written tradition. In contrast, the second focuses on two songs with similar musical and textual fabric (“Quanto mi dolse sta crudel partita” and “Quanto mi dolse la nigra partita”), which allude more closely to the oral tradition in their material and compositional characteristics. These examples, framed within the larger Neapolitan corpus, reveal the manifold and evolving interactions between written and oral song traditions in the dynamic cultural milieu of Aragonese Naples.</p>

<p>Since Anton Webern’s study of Henricus Isaac’s <em>Choralis Constantinus</em>, scholars of fifteenth-century polyphony have acknowledged the role of motivic permutation in the compositional process, employing modern analytical terminology to describe motives as Prime, Retrograde, Inversion, and Retrograde-Inversion. Scholarship has also identified the structural role of canonic palindromes and <em>cancrizans</em> in music from Machaut (Walters Robertson) through the generation of Obrecht and Josquin (Todd, Wegman, Blackburn). Beyond obvious structural canons, composers employed motivic permutation on a smaller, albeit nonetheless pervasive scale.</p>
<p>This paper identifies more complex approaches to motivic permutation than previously recognized in analyses of fifteenth-century polyphony, including extended melodic palindromes (motives elided to or followed by their retrograde), “inversodromes” (motives elided to or followed by their inversion), “retro-inversodromes” (motives elided to or followed their retrograde-inversion), and even more complex “crabindromes,” in which one of these techniques appears against its own “crab,” or mirror image.</p>

<p>A cluster of anonymous chansons in the <em>Chansonnier</em> El Escorial IV.a.24 reveals a particular fascination with complex melodic permutations, palindromes, and mirror images. The combinative chanson <em>Averte oculos/Avertissiés vostre doulx euil</em>, replete with inverted and mirror canons, derives its Latin Tenor not from a lost liturgical chant (Hanen, Southern, Maniates), but from the fact that it is perfectly consonant with its own inversion. <em>Je n’ay que deul est desplaisance</em>, recognized for its polyphonic citation of the chanson <em>Puisque fortune m’est sy dure</em>, opens with a striking crabindrome and contains extensive motivic permutations. Another chanson about Fortune, <em>Par desplaisir tout plain d’anoy</em>, includes an extended palindrome and melodic themes that are their own retrograde-inversions. Similar mirror motives also occur in Ockeghem’s <em>Missa Quinti toni</em>, Josquin’s <em>Missa L’ami baudichon</em>, and Isaac’s <em>Palle, palle, palle</em>, not surprising considering its probable relationship to Busnois’ <em>Fortuna desperata</em>.</p>
<p>Such serious play has eluded identification in part because composers conceal such passages through rhythmic alteration and mutation. Recognition that composers perceived motives as complex—as a combination of potentials and limitations based on their essence (“<em>littera</em>”), quality (“<em>vox</em>”), myriad potential permutations, and elisions—promises deeper understanding of the compositional process and offers methods for distinguishing between compositional intent and analytical imagination.</p>
