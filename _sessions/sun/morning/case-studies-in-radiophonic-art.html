<p class="abs-title">Soundscaping the Radio: Sonic Witnessing and the Resonances of Experimental Radio Soundwork through Electroacoustic Soundscape Composition</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kate Galloway (Wesleyan University/Memorial University of Newfoundland)</p>

<p>In 1975 Vancouver Co-op Radio launched, broadcasting challenging sounds to local listeners’ ears. Radio operated as an important medium for composer, radio artist, and sound ecologist Hildegard Westerkamp to broadcast soundscape programming on her Vancouver Co-op Radio program <em>Soundwalking</em>. Soundscape radio work highlights processes of sonic witnessing, and explores the political and musical potential of remediated field recordings. The “ethnographic ear,” following Erlmann, of experimental soundscape radio provokes audiences to listen to the materiality of environmental change. Westerkamp’s <em>Under the Flightpath</em> (1981), for instance, uses microphone placements, interviewing techniques, and the sound-processing technologies of the sound studio to interrogate the social and sonic impact of the 1970s expansion of the Vancouver International Airport.</p>
<p>National and community radio programming in Canada shaped developments in electroacoustic soundscape composition. I contextualize the source of Westerkamp’s inspiration within the intellectual discourse on sound and the environment during the 1960s and 70s by such figures as composer and World Soundscape Project founder R. Murray Schafer and media theorist Marshall McLuhan. Westerkamp, a member of the World Soundscape Project, participated in the collective’s soundscape documentation initiatives used in <em>Soundscapes of Canada</em> (1974), a series of one-hour programs broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). At this time, CBC embraced experimental radiophonic formats, broadcasting Glenn Gould’s <em>Solitude Trilogy</em> across national radio (1967–77). In soundscape radio we hear how the World Soundscape Project used diverse radio techniques to cultivate sensory experience and cultural intimacy through soundwork, establishing approaches to composing electroacoustically with acoustic soundscapes.</p>
<p>I examine and apply media archeology to the repertoire from the radio programs <em>Soundscapes of Canada</em> and <em>Soundwalking</em>, and argue that soundscape radiowork produced by members of the World Soundscape Project developed listeners’ auditory acuity, and curated and remediated the soundscape during a period of robust urbanism and dynamic soundscape shifts. Building on scholarship that rethinks radio’s function in the propagation of experimental soundwork, and drawing on archival materials and aural histories, I trace the rarely examined influence of experimental radio on the compositional developments of soundscape composition, and suggest that soundscape radio programming cultivated opportunities for experimental soundwork to communicate social and environmental politics.</p>

<p class="abs-title">105.9 WHBI-FM and the Cassette Economy of Early Hip Hop</p>
<p class="abs-author">John Klaess (Yale University)</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, hip-hop radio programs formed a nexus coordinating the spaces, sounds, and practices of the genre’s nascent commercial period. Produced by members of the hip-hop community, and often airing between midnight and 6 a.m. on local-access stations, these programs balanced play of commercial recordings—circulated by vinyl record—with home-made demo tapes and recordings of live performances—circulated by cassette tape. These radio programs were themselves faithfully recorded to cassette by fans, becoming valuable objects that increased the pace and range of hip-hop’s dissemination. The media through which, and protocols by which, hip-hop circulated thus consolidated a musical economy nested within the broader commercial economy.</p>
<p>Yet studies of hip-hop’s early commercial period typically assign a privileged position to the recording industry. Where radio appears, it is discussed as a dissemination mechanism for studio recordings. Such focus occludes the on-the-ground social relations and media fundamental to hip-hop’s circulation. I broaden the scope to the multiple institutions driving hip-hop’s commercialization—the radio and record industries—and to the networks of production and exchange linking them.</p>
<p>In this paper I trace the circulation of tapes across the nodes of the cassette economy, emphasizing both their content and materiality. Drawing on extant recordings, as well as interviews I conducted with radio DJs between 2014 and 2016, I work outward from a series of programs airing on New York’s WHBI 105.9FM between 1979 and 1985 towards the networks in which they were situated. Among the shows I consider are the World Famous Supreme Team Show, DJ Afrika Islam’s Zulu Beats, and the Awesome Two Show. These networks are messy and complex. Attending to the circulation of hip-hop across chains of remediation in the cassette economy, I examine the social and technological relations integral to the early hip-hop community. I show that the networks of the cassette economy were generative, characterized by feedback-loops rather than linear trajectories. Decentering the record industry as the driving force of commercialization thus expands our understanding of the practices and media facilitating hip-hop’s circulation, pointing to a more diverse coalition of actors, institutions, and labors.</p>


<p class="abs-title">In Search of a Futurist Radio Aesthetic</p>
<p class="abs-author">Danielle Simon (University of California, Berkeley)</p>

<p>Pino Masnata’s 1931 opera for the radio, titled <em>Il cuore di Wanda</em> or <em>Tum-tum ninna nanna</em>, features a cast of unlikely characters: Wanda, her lover Mario, and Wanda’s heart. The heart plays the undisputed starring role in the production; its soprano voice sings of Wanda’s love for Mario until he flattens it into the shape of a record, so that it can only play the two-step dance “Tum Tum.” Widely billed as the first Italian opera composed specifically for the radio, the fifteen-minute broadcast seemed to herald the birth of a new art form, one that could access uniquely interior voices and bridge the gap between man and machine. Two years later, in collaboration with F. T. Marinetti, Masnata penned a futurist manifesto that embraced radio as a fully artistic medium. The outspoken futurist leaders heralded radio as “human, universal, and cosmic” and as a vocal art possessed of the capacity to engage the “true psychology-spirituality” of both the sounds of the voice and silence. True radiophonic art, they proselytized, should be simultaneously human and technological, universal and psychological, silent and spoken/ sung.</p>
<p>Drawing on insights from scholars of fascism and media studies including Margaret Fisher, Marcia Landy, and Walter Adamson, this paper seeks to examine what the voice meant for Futurist radiophonic art. It suggests that futurist radiophonic works were the first to highlight the medium’s potential for achieving the desired “metallization” of the human body advocated by Marinetti. Drawing on a variety of archival sources from popular radio magazines to futurist publications, this paper demonstrates how futurist productions for the radio—aside from print, perhaps the most politically charged platform available to the movement—foreground the fusion of humans and technology and the strange power and freedom of the mediated human voice. By exploiting radio’s lack of image to access otherwise inaccessible interior voices, works like <em>Tum-tum ninna nanna</em> explored the psychological implications of modern communication technologies and the possibility of collapsing space and time and reconfiguring the human by broadcasting the voice.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Pierre Schaeffer’s <em>La coquille à planètes</em> and Experiments in French Wartime Radio Production</p>
<p class="abs-author">Alexander Stalarow (University of California, Davis)</p>

<p>In a small studio on the left bank of occupied Paris, a group of French authors, musicians, and sound engineers led by Pierre Scheffer dedicated most of 1943–44 to experiments in radiophonic creation. The Studio d’Essai realized a diverse array of radio programs, conducted research to improve recording and broadcasting standards, and offered training programs in various technical and artistic aspects of radio production. Schaeffer brought these diverse activities together by writing and producing the “radiophonic opera” <em>La coquille à planètes</em>, which aired in eight hour-long installments in 1944, responding to contemporary French writers who hailed radio <em>le huitème art</em>. <em>La coquille</em> dramatizes the young Leonard’s encounters with monstrous incarnations of the twelve zodiac signs in contemporary Paris. Its form takes full advantage of radio’s expressive potential, negotiating between action and commentary, spoken dialogue and song, and between noisy soundscapes and composer Claude Arrieu’s orchestral score.</p>
<p>This paper draws upon <em>La coquille</em>’s libretto and recording, Schaeffer’s contemporary writing on radiophonic art, and archival sources detailing the work’s production and the Studio d’Essai’s other activities from 1943 to ’44. In bringing these sources together, I examine <em>La coquille</em> not only as an experimental aesthetic product, but as an administrative experiment in French radiophonic art production. Schaeffer used <em>La coquille</em> as a pretext to interest figures from other French Radio departments in radiophonic art, including Claude Arrieu and such established artists as stage and film actor Louis Salou and singer Pierre Bernac. Their collaboration enriched the artistic merit of <em>La coquille</em> and the quality of the hands-on training curriculum for Studio d’Essai interns, who worked side-by-side with professionals on all aspects of the work’s realization. Reports of the production’s successes and failures influenced institutional standards for production scheduling, the division of creative and technical labor, and recording practices for French Radio programming writ large. Considering how both <em>La coquille</em>’s form and its means of production were tailored specifically for French Radio reveals specific ways this national institution shaped many forms of mid-century art.</p>
