<p class="abs-title">To Joy and Failure: Ingmar Bergman’s Musicians</p>
<p class="abs-author">Per Broman (Bowling Green State University)</p>

<p>During the 1960s, critics faulted Ingmar Bergman for his lack of engagement with world problems, casting him as a self-centered navel gazer whose films mined the minutia of his own amorous and religious experiences. Yet, while Bergman’s reality is rarely political, the musical discourse in his films offers a consistent commentary on social order and the vicissitudes of human existence, not least through the frequent musician characters. The musicians appear on a wide variety of occasions, often suddenly and unexpectedly, and reveal, through music making and musical metaphors, central tenets of Bergman’s aesthetics. For example, in <em>To Joy</em> (1950) Bergman uses the soloist ambitions of the main protagonist as a symbol of pride in the conformist Swedish society as opposed to serving society’s greater good as an orchestral musician.</p>
<p>Departing from resources in The Bergman Archives in Stockholm, this paper explores Bergman’s use of musicians in and its role in his aesthetic vision. Following an overview of Bergman’s thinking about music, I demonstrate the essential roles the many musician characters play in the filmic narratives, focusing on his second-to-last auteur film, <em>In the Presence of a Clown</em> (1997), in which the dying Franz Schubert plays an important role as a character in the play-within-the-play. In the film, Schubert symbolizes the failure of the artist on a human level, but the music and the drama becomes transformational in the lives of the audience.</p>
<p>The notion of music’s and the musicians’ power—as a mirror of and temporary refuge from the struggles of everyday life—expressed in Bergman’s films constitutes if not a stronger at least a more consistent a message than the central ideas often highlighted in discussions of his works. The way the musicians speak about and use music remains virtually the same from his first film <em>Crisis</em> (1946) to his last, <em>Saraband</em> (2003). In contrast, Bergman’s more widely recognized religious and existential themes, such as the silence of God, were much more localized in his productions from the late 1950s and early 1960s. In this respect, music presents a vital path into the essence of Bergman’s production.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Articulation of Performance and Character through Music in the Films of James Dean</p>

<p>Shortly after James Dean’s death, François Truffaut wrote that Dean’s acting in his three feature films “flies in the face of fifty years of filmmaking; each gesture, attitude, each mimicry is a slap at the psychological tradition. Dean acts something beyond what he is saying.” Truffaut constructs this “something beyond” as being ineffable, impossible to describe in words, but one might more usefully see Dean’s performances as being articulated by something more concrete; namely, music. All three of the films Dean starred in before his death in 1955 at age twenty-four feature prominent musical scores. In <em>East of Eden</em> (Elia Kazan, 1955) and <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> (Nicholas Ray, 1955) the actor’s radically stylized performances are aided in their communication with the audience by Leonard Rosenman’s scores, which draw equally from modernist concert music and traditional Hollywood film scoring practices, helping to negotiate the gap between Dean’s characters on the screen and his audience in the cinema. The dissonance in the music matches the dissonance of Dean’s characterizations, described by Truffaut as containing within them “all our ambiguity, our duality, our human weaknesses.” The ambiguity and duality of tonality and atonality provides a musical illustration of Dean’s characters’ confused psyches. Rosenman’s scores were groundbreaking in their attempt to score not merely the action and mood of the film in classical Hollywood style, but also the psychology of the protagonists as they attempt to negotiate midcentury American masculinity. In <em>Giant</em> (George Stevens, 1956), on the other hand, Dean’s performance as the inarticulate oil man Jett Rink is betrayed by Dimitri Tiomkin’s traditional “Western” score, the lumbering cowboy theme given to Rink so at odds with the performance on screen that the music acts as a barrier between audience and character. <em>Giant</em> is usually seen as Dean’s least successful performance, and the music is at least in part to blame. Film music scholarship has usually focused on the role of music in articulating filmic narrative, but an analysis of these three performances and scores will attempt to open a space for analysing music’s role in creating character, scoring the actor and his/her role.</p>
