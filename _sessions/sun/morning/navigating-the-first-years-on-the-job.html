<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>There are a number of unique challenges faced by faculty members in the early stages of their career. Oftentimes, the transition from completion of the dissertation to a new faculty position is difficult. The session will offer practical advice for beginning professionals from a wide variety of academic institutions: community colleges; liberal arts colleges; departments and/or schools of music; independent conservatories; and research institutions. Our panelists will address the different kinds of responsibilities and unique deadlines that one will encounter the first two years on the job. The anticipated topics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Balancing teaching, research, service demands, and family;</li>
  <li>Being more self-directed in oneâ€™s work and research;</li>
  <li>Navigating peer-review procedures;</li>
  <li>Teaching effectively and efficiently</li>
  <li>Immediately preparing for contract renewals after one or two years at an institution; and</li>
  <li>Understanding the culture of an institution and becoming an effective agent within it, including networking and working effectively with the new colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following presentations by the panelists, there will be an opportunity for questions to the panel from the audience and open discussion of issues relating to the topics presented. Each speaker will give a talk of about twenty minutes, with ample time for questions and discussion, both after the individual talks, and after the completion of them all.</p>
