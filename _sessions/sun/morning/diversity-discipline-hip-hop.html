<p>In the introduction to his 2004 book <i>Making Beats: The Art of
Sample-Based Hip-Hop</i>, Joseph Schloss notes the relative absence of
music studies in hip-hop discourse:</p>

<blockquote><p>It does no disservice to previous work to say that [hip-hop studies] has
tended to focus on certain areas (such as the influence of the cultural logic
of late capitalism on urban identities, the representation of race in popular
culture, etc.) to the exclusion of others (such as the specific aesthetic
goals that artists have articulated). Nor is it a criticism to say that this
is largely a result of its methodologies, which have, for the most part, been
drawn from literary analysis. We must simply note that there are blank spaces
and then set about to filling them in.</p></blockquote>

<p>While hip-hop studies has continued to grow into a formidable
interdisciplinary force covering a wide range of repertoire from multiple
disciplinary angles, the situation Schloss describes still persists fourteen
years later, and music studies remain relatively uncited in broader hip-hop
scholarship. Since the early contributions of Tricia Rose (1994), Robert
Walser (1995) and Adam Krims (2000), other scholars have contributed to
discussions of hip-hop and race (Keyes 2004, Kajikawa 2015), religion
(Miyakawa 2005), flow (Adams 2009), postcolonialism (Rollefson 2017), and
gender and sexuality (Gaunt 2006, Kehrer 2017). This session has three
purposes: first, to present the plurality of current research in music theory
and musicology that engages with a range of hip-hop topics; second, to
consider ongoing issues of representation and ethical engagement; and third,
to provide a forum for a productive dialogue on the role of music studies
within the wider area studies and to highlight opportunities for
collaboration. Descriptions of eight short presentations within the session
follow.</p>
