<p class="abs-title">Playwriting in Song: “Reprise Types” in Stephen Sondheim’s <em>Sweeney Todd</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Nathan Beary Blustein (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Reprise pervades <em>Sweeney</em>’s score: every character recalls passages from earlier songs, altering music and lyrics according to the dramatic circumstances that bring him or her to recall an earlier tune. Analysis of reprise in musical theatre traditionally foregrounds the relationship between a song and its later recurrences. Yet in <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, many reprises bear striking similarities to each other—not in the music that they recall, but how recurring musical material functions within the formal, tonal, and motivic context of each new song. Seemingly disparate songs—in setting, dramatic situation, and emotional stake—can be linked when characters use the same “reprise type.” By studying the creative process behind <em>Sweeney</em>’s songs and numbers, as well as comparing different recordings, I argue that close reading of the music-theatrical conventions at play within <em>Sweeney</em>’s reprises (1) informs the relationships between characters and (2) amplifies, supplements, or even contradicts the story unfolding on stage.</p>

<p>First, I compare four songs throughout the show in which either Anthony or Johanna recalls an earlier song. Both “Ah, Miss” and “Kiss Me!” oscillate between two sections before blossoming into lyrical reprises that achieve tonal closure; by contrast, both “Pretty Women” and “City on Fire!” are disrupted by reprises. Next, I examine the two songs that Todd and Mrs. Lovett sing in the Act I finale, “Epiphany” and “A Little Priest.” Opposing forces seemingly guide this scene from all sides, but each song begins similarly, building up to a “corrected” reprise of one of the show’s first songs.</p>

<p>What does it mean for film music—subordinated, contingent, and “unheard”— to be plucked from its intended context and placed at the forefront of listener attention? The tradition of excerpting and arranging movie scores for the concert hall poses this question sharply. While scholarship on “cinematic listening” has picked up in recent years, the specifically music-theoretical issues raised by this repertoire have been largely unaddressed. I argue that far from squeezing programmatic-music into absolute-music containers, film-as-concert music presents hearing “cinematically” as a valid alternative to structural modes of listening, albeit one less reliant on imaginative visualization and narrativization than previously maintained.</p>
<p>This presentation investigates a subset of the film-as-concert corpus: standalone scherzi originating from action setpieces. More than any other type of underscore, action cues answer to dramatic/editorial/visual imperatives rather than “absolute” logic. My core data emerges from a detailed study of all thirty-four of John Williams’s film/concert scherzi, with emphasis on setpieces from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. I develop a comparative methodology that highlights small but impactful formal changes across different generations of a cue/piece. I isolate a set of compositional strategies that are employed to impute coherence to procedures that might otherwise disturb customs of musical unity (and sometimes still do). My analyses emphasize the way in which formal alterations bring about drastically different ways of hearing the work tonally and expressively across multiple versions. To conclude, I propose that hearing unarranged film cues-as-absolute music is a viable and in-fact widely practiced form of musical engagement.</p>
