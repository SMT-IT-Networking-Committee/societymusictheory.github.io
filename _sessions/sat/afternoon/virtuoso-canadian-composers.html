<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><em>Garage</em>. Written as the score for Director Edmond Chan’s prizewinning film of the same name, Alice Ho’s virtuoso composition captures the fear and angst of trapped individuals who are desperately trying to escape from an underground garage.</p>
<p><em>Vast.</em> Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, Chan Ka Nin was born in Hong Kong and moved to Vancouver as a teenager, where he studied with Jean Coulthard, one of Vancouver’s finest twentieth‐century composers. Chan skillfully blends Eastern and Western influences in this virtuoso work<em>,</em> which has become one of his most popular piano pieces.</p>
<p><em>Threnody</em>. Barbara Pentland and Vancouverite Jean Coulthard were founding members of the University of British Columbia’s School of Music. With influences ranging from Ralph Vaughan Williams to Arnold Schoenberg, Jean Coulthard was a significant Canadian composer known for her lyrical style. Her poignant requiem <em>Threnody</em> combines modern harmonies and references to J. S. Bach’s Cantata BWV 3, “Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid” [O God, how many a heartache].</p>
<p><em>Shattered Ice</em>. The mythic Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic became a reality in 2013 with the first transit of a commercial cargo vessel. Broadcast around the world, Réa Beaumont’s exciting composition <em>Shattered Ice</em> evokes the pristine northern landscape and cautions that man’s intrusion may destroy its fragile ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Vincula</em>. Originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and later based in Vancouver, Barbara Pentland was one of Canada’s most important and stylistically adventurous composers of the twentieth century. In her program notes for <em>Vincula</em>, Latin for “bonds,” Pentland writes, “The title refers not only to the unifying factor of a common source for the whole piece, but also the fetters of poverty and famine, persecution and fear, afflicting so many living beings.” Stemming from her work with the composer, Réa Beaumont is the author of the book <em>Composer Barbara Pentland,</em> for which she was named “a world authority” in the field (CBC Radio 2).</p>
<p><em>Zephyrus</em>. With works performed at the ISCM, award-winning Vancouver composer Jordan Nobles is known for his beautifully crafted delicate pieces that are exemplified by this piece, named after the Greek god of the west wind.</p>
<p><em>The Goodbye</em>. This piece was written as a tribute to one of Canada’s most promising conductors, Maestro Wallace Leung (1968–2002), who passed away suddenly but left an indelible mark on those who knew him. It marks the upcoming fifteenth anniversary of the loss of this close friend.</p>
<p><em>Sonata</em>. This is the first of nineteen piano sonatas written by Polish‐Canadian composer Walter Buczynski, Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto and a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth Medal. A melodic fragment from the opening of the work forms the basis of this virtuosic sonata. All movements are performed <em>attaca</em> before culminating in an exhilarating climax.</p>
