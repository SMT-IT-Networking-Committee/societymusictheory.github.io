<p class="abs-title">Listening to the Old City: Street Cries and Urbanization in Second-Empire Paris</p>

<p>The ubiquitous cries of Paris’s street hawkers, known as the <em>cris de Paris</em>, have captured the Parisian literary imagination since the Middle Ages. During the 1850s and ’60s, however, urban demolition severely disturbed the everyday rhythms of street commerce. As Paris was “bludgeoned into modernity” (Harvey 2003), hawkers faced stricter zoning laws, and the liminal spaces in which they dwelled vanished from the map. The proliferation of books, poetry, and musical works featuring the <em>cris de Paris</em> at this time suggests that many Parisians feared the eventual disappearance of the city’s iconic sights and sounds. Although scholars have increasingly turned to Paris’s urban landscape to contextualize individual works (especially operas), a broader perspective reveals how musicians historicized Paris’s street cries to express nostalgia for the city’s past.</p>
<p>Evoking Pierre Nora’s concept of “memory sites” as a point of entry, I demonstrate how the <em>cris de Paris</em> were preserved, glorified, and commodified through musical transcription and adaptation. My central case study is a book by JeanGeorges Kastner entitled <em>Les voix de Paris</em> (1857), which narrates the evolution and musical representation of street cries from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Kastner supplements his prose with representative musical examples, and includes pseudo-ethnographic transcriptions that record his own experiences of street noise. The book’s critical reception reflects contemporaneous concerns about urban change; for instance, Joseph d’Ortigue remarked that “street cries are disappearing, along with the vestiges of the old city.” Kastner’s study also provided material for composers searching for urban verisimilitude; stage works such as Offenbach’s <em>Mesdames de la Halle</em> (1858) and Charpentier’s <em>Louise</em> (1900) quote directly from Kastner’s transcriptions. Though largely overlooked by music historians, the <em>cris de Paris</em> played an important role in the emergence of midcentury musical <em>réalisme</em>, while their perceived disappearance inspired a wave of poetic responses epitomized in Baudelaire’s <em>Le Spleen de Paris</em> (1869). Drawing on archival materials from the Bibliothèque nationale de France and from the Archives de la Préfecture de Police, this paper explores the reception of street noise in French music criticism, and sheds new light on how everyday sounds helped articulate Parisian urban identity.</p>

<p>Singing and performing on barrel organs, violins, harps, and guitars, the <em>musiciens ambulants</em>, or itinerant musicians, were inextricably connected to urban street life in nineteenth-century Paris. While they were widely celebrated and romanticized in city culture, they also roused tremendous controversy over their use of street space. Some itinerant musicians blurred boundaries between public and private as they projected their music through residential windows and performed in the front courtyards of large estates. Other <em>musiciens ambulants,</em> who occupied fixed positions in squares, parks, and street corners, gathered crowds and interfered with city circulation. As these performers problematized urban space, they provoked the concern of the bourgeois class and civic administration, who feared the itinerant musicians were involved with crime, dissention, and even espionage. While scholars have attributed these social apprehensions to class prejudice and xenophobia, I assert that the concerns stirred by the <em>musiciens ambulants</em> were compounded by their performance practices and the mediation of the urban environment.</p>
<p>Building upon recent work related to music and space (Born, 2013 and Boutin, 2015), I contend that the urban context shaped the social reception of <em>musiciens ambulants</em> between 1830 and 1880. Drawing from the writings of Édouard Fétis, Victor Fournel, Gustave Droz, as well as police reports, I examine the musical habits of itinerant musicians; this investigation reveals how the performers’ use of city property and their interactions with urban dwellers triggered initiatives to sonically and socially regulate street space. In particular, I analyze Legouix’s vaudeville <em>Les marchands des chansons</em> (1837) and Battmann’s piano quadrille <em>Les musiciens ambulants</em> (1863), pieces that encapsulate the public’s complex response to itinerant performances. Finally, I claim that the <em>musiciens ambulants</em> caused Parisians to interrogate the public use of the urban landscape, particularly as city officials prepared for the International Exposition of 1867. This paper not only presents an enriched portrait of the itinerant musicians’ profession, but it also illustrates how the <em>musiciens ambulants</em> stimulated a vigorous discourse about the use of urban space and, ultimately, propelled the development of street policy in Paris.</p>
