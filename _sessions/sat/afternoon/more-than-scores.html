<p>This is an exciting moment in musicological research, as more
projects—whether journal articles, books, or archival projects—take advantage
of digital tools to make the objects of study present. A diverse range of
digital objects—musical recordings, facsimiles of a unique archival documents,
datasets—are now being incorporated into scholarly work. But the influence of
even the most excellent scholarship is muted if it cannot be preserved for
future reference, and even more importantly, made reliably discoverable to all
who might seek it.</p>

<p>The key to discoverability is metadata. Music librarians are, of course,
quite familiar with the challenges of using many of the common standards
(Dublin Core, METS, FRBR) to describe and classify musical works, with their
complex networks of derivations (the piano four-hands version a symphony) and
manifestations (the various recorded performances of the same). The kinds of
metadata that might accrue in a digital project about music can be even more
complex, with a welter of roles (not only composer, publisher, and performer,
but also editor, contributor, analyst, commentator, and so on), and analytic
types (such as measure numbers, staves, instruments, genres, keys, patterns,
etc.) that might figure in any given research environment. Scholars themselves
are often less familiar with the ramifications of creating useful metadata for
their projects. In the digitally networked world of music scholarship,
musicologists need to prioritize being good stewards of the metadata of their
projects: understand what metadata is needed; collaborate with publishers,
librarians, archivists, grant funding bodies, and scholarly societies to
amplify discoverability; teach students how to use metadata to find and utilize
the most rigorous scholarly work; etc.</p>
