<p class="abs-title">Hidden in Our Publications: New Concordances, Quotations, and Citations in Fourteenth-Century Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Scott Cuthbert (MIT)</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of known fourteenth- and early fifteenth century music already appears in print. Over the past sixty years, using myriad manuscript and facsimile sources, the editors of series such as <em>Polyphonic Music of the Fourteenth Century</em> identified many quotations and concordances among pieces. Since the completion of the major “M2” series, the vast majority of new concordances and new similarities have come from the discovery of new sources, primarily fragments. Yet with almost 2,500 pieces from the period already discovered, giving over 3 million pairs of pieces which could have connections, is it not possible that many citations have been missed?</p>
<p>This paper says, “Yes.” By pairing a new MusicXML database I have created of transcriptions of over eighty percent of the known repertory from 1300 to 1420, with my music21 software toolkit, I have been able to identify over forty definitive cases of quotation, citation, or borrowing. The paper alternates brief explanations of the methodology for identifying citations computationally with presentations of ten of these new citations and their implications.</p>
<p>Among the most important discoveries are: the bawdy source for Machaut’s last unidentified motet tenor (<em>Bone Pastor</em>), an unknown use of parody by Ciconia, new polyphony in the Tournai Mass manuscript, new concordances for Zachara da Teramo and Hubertus de Salinis, citations between Credos by Feragut and Tapissier, and new identifications of earlier repertories on the back of initial letters of the manuscript Bologna Q15. Two new identifications of Italian composers for what were previously assumed to be French works give further evidence to an aspect of my <em>ars mutandi</em> theory that much of the anonymous French repertory of the post-Machaut period is of Italian origin.</p>

<p>As new studies of medieval scribal practice continue to transform our understanding of music writing and collection during the later middle ages, the few surviving manuscripts of English provenance increasingly are due for scholarly reassessment. Rediscovered in 1971, the manuscript NYpm M. 978 is one of two sources for the well-known conductus <em>Singularis laudis digna</em>, a work perhaps best known for its persistent association with Philippa of Hainault, Queen of England and apocryphal savior of the Burghers of Calais. A miscellany of polyphonic sacred music, NYpm M. 978 has been identified as a choirbook attributed to the (or a) chapel of Edward III, or perhaps the household of his daughter Isabella, Countess of Bedford, and her husband, Enguerrand of Coucy. Existing scholarship dates the manuscript to ca. 1360–77; however, as I will show, this date was settled upon in error, due to a misunderstanding of historical context, with regard to the beginning of Anglo-French hostilities prior to the Hundred Years’ War and the text of <em>Singularis laudis digna</em>, as well as a misconstrual of the method and timeline of its construction.</p>
<p>In this paper, I argue that NYpm M. 978 was constructed in stages over a period of some thirty to forty years, beginning ca. 1335–36. Despite attempts to make the manuscript appear more cohesive, including immoderate decoration with red ink, close study reveals at least five distinct scribal hands using a minimum of two separate fonts, suggesting that the manuscript had multiple authors. The condition of the leaves, which in addition to significant water damage also exhibit erasures and amendations, indicates that NYpm M. 978 may have survived unbound as a fascicle manuscript for some time before its initial binding. Finally, careful examination of hitherto unobserved markings on the final leaf reveals the existence of other folia subsequently disengaged from rest of the manuscript. I conclude by proposing that NYpm M. 978 demonstrates a long-term engagement with a score by a group of medieval musicians, challenging the prevailing theory that new musical works quickly supplanted older ones prior to the invention of print.</p>
