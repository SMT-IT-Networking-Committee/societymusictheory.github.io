<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em> (1787) begins with an attempted rape scene. The victim, Donna Anna, later tells her fiancé Don Ottavio, who listens, believes, and vows vengeance. But as musicologist Micaela Baranello recently asked, are we willing to listen to and believe Donna Anna? Many productions suggest that we should not, painting Donna Anna as a woman seduced, rather than a woman coerced (Baranello, “When Cries of Rape Are Heard in Opera Halls,” <em>New York Times,</em> 16 July 2015). Importantly, the way that we view <em>Don Giovanni</em> represents a norm of both culture and genre, rather than an exception.</p>
<p>In 1979, Catherine Clément argued that opera features a parade of dying women. The new millennium, however, may challenge us to acknowledge the way that opera features a parade of raped women—Verdi’s Gilda, Shostakovich’s Katerina, Gershwin’s Bess, Britten’s Lucretia, and Carlisle Floyd’s Susannah. Rape culture is embedded in Western culture through centuries of cultural productions, many of which sit at the center of the operatic canon. Musicologists thus know that the so-called rape “crisis” is not at all new and instead deeply ingrained in the traditions we uphold in the classroom and on stage. As scholars across the arts and humanities strive for institutional and public relevance, musicologists working on opera have something urgent to offer. Indeed, the events on the musical stage—and their glamorization—are not far removed from the crises within our own campus communities and those in cities and towns across the country.</p>
<p>This panel represents a musicological response to the release of a campus climate survey, designed and administered in 2014–15 by the American Association of Universities, in which twenty-seven institutions participated. The survey’s “key findings” indicate that “11.7 percent of student respondents<span class="nobr"> . . .</span> reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force, threats of physical force, or incapacitation since they enrolled at their university” (AAU Campus Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct: Overview, Key Findings, Executive Summary, <a href="http://www.aau.edu/Climate-Survey.aspx?id=16525)">http://www.aau.edu/Climate-Survey.aspx?id=16525).</a> Notably, the year 2015 also saw the publication of a list of almost a hundred colleges and universities facing Title IX investigations for the mishandling of their students’ sexual assault allegations. Thus the issue of sexual violence on stage, perhaps now more than ever before, has the potential to help students and scholars at all stages of their careers make sense of the institutional and power structures that have normalized a rape culture. In an age of violence, as well as heightened sensitivity to that violence, musicologists and students who encounter violence in the works they teach and study are required to negotiate through an increasingly complicated musical and political landscape. The speakers on this panel will address sexual violence in opera, offering strategies for engagement in musicological research, as well as for bridging the space between the classroom and students’ lived experience.</p>
<p>The panel is comprised of five panelists, each giving a ten-minute position paper. Richard Will examines productions of <em>Don Giovanni</em> that critique the opera’s sexual violence, generally by foregrounding it and characterizing the hero as more predator than rake. Dating from the early 1980s onwards, many of the same productions also introduce what amount to motivations for Don Giovanni’s behavior, sometimes psychological (rape as neurotic compulsion), and sometimes social (rape as male birthright, whether in an aristocracy or some comparably phallocentric modern setting). Paradoxically, the motivations often neutralize the critique, representing violence as a pathology from which audiences may safely separate themselves.</p>
<p>Micaela Baranello discusses the staging of sexual violence in opera ballets on the contemporary stage. While ballets are often dismissed as superfluous, productions by directors such as David McVicar (<em>Faust</em>) and Damiano Michieletto (<em>Guillaume Tell</em> ) have used their flexible narrative space to stage scenes of violence against women (often drawing on the historical legacy of dancers’ lives). Baranello interrogates the extent to which these interpolations serve to reveal historical misogyny, or, to revel in women’s degradation.</p>
<p>Monica Hershberger examines the performance and reception history of Carlisle Floyd’s <em>Susannah</em> (1955), demonstrating how since its premiere, music critics, commentators, and opera companies have routinely dismissed or excused the opera’s rape scene as a “seduction” scene. Hershberger argues that <em>Susannah</em> exposes both the historical and continued misuse and conflation of the words “seduction” and “rape.” As one of the most performed American operas in the United States (and a favorite among college and conservatory opera programs), <em>Susannah</em> offers performers, scholars, and audiences the opportunity to critique contemporary rape culture.</p>
<p>Turning to the American college campus, Bonnie Gordon uses the 1608 Mantuan wedding festivities, most famous for the stunning performance of Monteverdi’s <em>Lamento d’Arianna</em> to discuss the practice of teaching operatic scenes of rape to undergraduates. At Mantua, abduction and rape made for a passionate performance, and Gordon argues that the productions used sung performance to normalize rape as a central narrative in civic power. Gordon demonstrates how confronting these scenes of violence can give students intellectual tools to understand the crises around power-based violence that are affecting campuses across the nation.</p>
<p>Ellie M. Hisama considers two recent performances of staged works about the rape of Lucretia. In 2015, students at Columbia University presented a staged version of Handel’s cantata <em>La Lucrezia</em> in an effort to “bring to light the various forms of abuse, both physical and psychological, that occur in even the most intimate relationships.” Also in 2015, the Juilliard School presented a modern-dress interpretation of Britten’s <em>The Rape of Lucretia</em> in which the cast prepared by reading firsthand accounts of rape on college campuses. Hisama draws together reflections by directors and student musicians on these productions in order to explore how musical performance can serve as a powerful, direct commentary on campus rape culture.</p>
