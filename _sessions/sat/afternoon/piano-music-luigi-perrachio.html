<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>A few years ago, when my colleague Laurie Sampsel and I were investigating
the University of Colorado’s collection of scores from the library of the
Catalan pianist Ricardo Viñes, I discovered an intriguing volume by a composer
whose name I had never come across before: <i>Nove Poemetti</i> (Nine little
Poems) by Luigi Perrachio, including one, <i>Libellule</i>, inscribed to
Viñes.</p>

<p>Italian instrumental music was developing quickly in the early twentieth
century, with composers like Ottorino Respighi (1879–1936), Ildebrando Pizetti
(1880–1968), Gian Francesco Malipiero (1882–1973), Alfredo Casella
(1883–1947), and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (1895–1968) all making their
presence known on the international music scene by the 1920s. These and others
were promoted by the musicologist Guido Gatti (1892–1973), who was an
important advocate for Italian instrumental music at a time when the world
still saw Italy primarily as a home for opera. He was also an early admirer of
Luigi Perrachio, publishing an enthusiastic article in 1918.</p>

<p>Perrachio was born in Turin in 1883, the same year and city as Alfredo
Casella; Gatti linked the two as the “generation of 1883.” Perrachio was
taught piano and cello by his father, an amateur musician, but received law
degree from the University of Turin in 1908. Music called him strongly, and he
completed a degree in piano and composition in Bologna in 1913 after spending
time in Vienna, where he worked with the Moravian pianist and composer Ignaz
Brüll (1846–1907). After a sojourn in Paris, he returned to Turin, where he
established himself as a promoter of new music, founding a group known as the
“Double Quintet of Turin” dedicated to presenting new works. In 1924, he
published a small monograph on the piano works of Debussy. In 1925 he began
teaching at the Liceo Musicale (now Conservatorio) of Turin, first piano, and
later composition. He was an important mentor for a generation of Italian
composers, continuing to teach at the Conservatory until 1955. His
deteriorating health led to almost complete immobility, but he continued to
receive private students at his home until his death in 1966.</p>

<p>Today, he and his music are almost completely forgotten, although there are
some recent scholarly articles in Italian, including a brief survey of his
piano music by Attilio Piovano, and one CD recording of music for harp.
Perrachio seems to have suffered from undue modesty: he published only a small
fraction of his work, and he was willing to do so only after significant
arm-twisting from his supporters. Castelnuovo-Tedesco, in a review of the
<i>Nove Poemetti</i>, begins, “Yes, it is decided, finally! Luigi Perrachio
has published some of his piano pieces: more compelled by the affectionate
pressures of his friends than by the impulse of his own will.” </p>

<p><i>Nove Poemetti</i></p>

<p>Each of these little poems bears a descriptive title—an homage to the works of Debussy and Ravel that he loved. The musical expressions of the extramusical ideas are clear. The dedications include musicologists (Gatti, Brugnoni), composers (Casella, Malipiero), and pianists (Ricardo Viñes, Clara Sansoni). </p>

<p>1. <i>Sera</i> (Evening), June 1917, to Casella. Words from the French symbolist Paul Fort (1872–1960) head the score. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Le soir tombe . . . C’est l’heure où Pan, rêveur, siffle dans
    la forêt. Le rossignol caché lui répond; et leurs trilles montent, se
    poursuivant dans les arbres qui brillent; tant pour les écouter, la lune
    est venue près . . . Le satyre s’est tû, et l’oiseau se lamente . . . Plus un
    bruit . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. <i>Zefiro</i> (Zephyr), May 1920, to Anita Olivero (a friend?). Unattributed words at the top of the score:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>nel quieto mattino<br>
    Zefiro folle scherzava<br>
    colle stille di rugiada<br>
    e coi fiori; <br>
    scherzava tra gli alberi<br>
    sugli alberi tra il fogliame<br>
    e la foresta tutta frusciava<br>
    sonante<br>
    come dolcissima arpa immensa . . . <br>
    E il cucu ridea a quello spasso . . .</p>
</blockquote>


<p>3. <i>La notte dei morti </i>(The night of the dead), May 1920, to Gatti.
Unattributed words:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>lenti gravi vanno e sereni;<br>
    i martiri gli eroi<br>
    le madri<br>
    i piccolo innocenti . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4. <i>Libellule</i> (Dragonflies), April 1917, dedicated Viñes.</p>

<p>8. <i>Notte</i> (Night), May 1920, to Attílio Brugnoli (1880–1937). Lines
by Giovanni Pascoli (1855–1912) extracted from his “La Notte”:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>. . . e in me trovai quel canto,<br>
    che si frangea nell’anima serena<br>
    piena, nell’alta opacità, de stelle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The twenty-five <i>Preludi</i>, composed in 1927 and dedicated to the
pianist Anna Urani, are in part an homage to Bach (explicitly mentioned in the
score on the final page), but musically seem to have more to do with the
concise preludes of Chopin, Scriabin, and others who based their cycles on the
circle of fifths. In 1926, Perrachio had published a hree-hundred-page
monograph on Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier, so the idea of doing some kind of
cycle through all the keys was likely fresh in his mind. There are no
superfluous notes here, and clarity is clearly at the forefront of his
conception. </p>

<p>Perrachio chooses a key scheme that is his alone, but which is inspired by
the circle-of-fifths key scheme used by Chopin in his op. 28 cycle, rather
than Bach’s chromatic progression. Perrachio arrives at twenty-five instead of
twenty-four because he writes a prelude in F-sharp ( no. 16) <i>and</i> one in
G-flat (no. 17). Another twist on the key scheme, so that he can finish in
B-flat major instead of D minor (memorializing Bach), is that he inserts the
keys of one flat (F major and D minor) near the beginning of his cycle.
Perrachio alternates keys major-major-minor-minor instead of
major-minor-major-minor. He begins with C major, but detours to one flat (F
major) then goes to the initial relative minors (A minor, D minor) before
going to sharps (G major, E minor, B minor, D major, A major, F-sharp minor,
etc.). Perrachio writes, just before the final phrase of the last prelude, “In
nomine JOHANNIS SEBASTIANI,” and appends (in Italian) the Biblical line “The
truth shall set you free” (John 8:32) at the bottom of the same page—his
answer to Bach’s “soli Deo gloria” in the manuscript at the end of WTC I.</p>
