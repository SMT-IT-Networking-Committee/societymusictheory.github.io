<p>“Let them keep away from the churches compositions—whether vocal or instrumental—in which there is an intermingling of something wanton or impure” reads the sole official pronouncement on music issued by the Council of Trent during its twenty-second session on 17 September 1562. Subsequent rulings issued by regional authorities either echo the Council’s description of prohibited music as wanton or impure or describe it as “vanum” (vain or empty), “profanum” (profane), “obscaenum” (obscene), or “turpis” (foul). None of the diverse documents surviving from the period, however, use the words in this lexicon of opprobrium in reference to a specific composition by Lasso, Palestrina, or one of their contemporaries. Thus, the question remains as to what it actually was that Catholic composers avoided when they wrote liturgical music in the decades following Trent.</p>
<p>Orlando di Lasso provides one answer to that question in the extraordinary Magnificat he based on Cipriano De Rore’s <em>Da le belle contrade</em>. De Rore’s famous madrigal, a setting of lyrics describing the parting of two lovers at dawn, presents a tripartite musical form that turns, as commentators from Susan McClary to Giuseppe Gerbino have noted, on the contrast between the music of the protagonist’s narration in the outer sections and the “theatrical” music of the beloved’s central lament. In the Magnificat, Lasso deploys De Rore’s madrigal in a severely circumscribed fashion, focusing on the music associated with the opening image of Venus ascendant in the east—an image he reconfigures as the Blessed Virgin herself, the <em>Stella matutina</em> of the Litany of Loreto. The eccentric and theatrical gestures of the central lament, on the other hand, he eschews entirely. Although he would use similar means in other genres, in the liturgical music of the post-Tridentine Church, as he conceived it, such wanton gestures had no place.</p>

<p>Cipriano de Rore published his setting of <em>Scarco di doglia</em>, an anonymous sonnet, in 1548 in Gardano’s edition of the third book of five-voice madrigals. At the surface level, the text follows a familiar narrative: the male lover recalls a time when he was free from grief (“scarco di doglia”) but then the absence of his beloved makes him complain and grow sad. The sestina brings relief: the beautiful thought of her lofty beauty comforts him, and he imagines her voice telling him that there was never so true a lover as he. De Rore’s setting is predictably expressive. It is filled with E flats at significant moments, and it employs a highly affective cadence, very unusual in a G mollis composition, ending the first part on A mi at the words “lagn’e atrista.”</p>
<p>This text, and its music, would seem a strange choice to serve as the basis for a mass. But a close reading of Lasso’s compositional decisions about what material from the madrigal to use and where to place it in the mass reveals an allegorical reading entirely appropriate to the Eucharist. Lasso in effect distills the essence of the madrigal, keeping just four salient features: (1) the opening, with its highly affective use of E flat; (2) the mournful cadence on A mi that closes the first part; (3) the bright chordal opening of the second part, with its invocation of the “beautiful thought” (“bel pensier”) of the beloved’s image, which comforts both the lover in Cipriano’s madrigal and the devout participant in the mass; and (4) the musical motive and counterpoint associated with the beloved’s lofty beauty (“l’alta bellezza”), which de Rore repeats in her final words (“[the sun] does not see a lover more true than you”). By transforming de Rore’s madrigal through the careful use of these elements, Lasso mirrors the spiritual journey of the mass.</p>
