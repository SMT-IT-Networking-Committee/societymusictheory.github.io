<p class="abs-title">“Don’t read my diary when I’m gone”: Teaching Scene and Sketch Studies through <em>Kurt Cobain Journals</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Elizabeth Clendinning (Wake Forest University)</p>

<p>From the spiral-notebook replica front page of the volume <em>Kurt Cobain Journals</em> (2003), the front man of the grunge band Nirvana issues a challenge to the reader:</p>

<p>Don’t read my diary when I’m gone OK, I’m going to work now, when you wake up this morning, please read my diary. Look through my things, and figure me out.</p>

<p>For students of popular music, the quest to “figure out” an artist’s life and work from original artifacts is a compelling one, but not a simple task to teach in a large introductory survey course. Internet streaming services allow student access to musical recordings and interviews, and primary source anthologies provide access to reprinted collections of period writings. However, access to musical artifacts—the material culture of the production and consumption of music—is often limited to those living in proximity to popular music museum or archival collections.</p>
<p>Through discussing the content of the <em>Journals</em>, which includes exact reprints of Cobain’s draft lyrics, genre analyses, illustrations, and other documents, I argue that published reproductions of artist-created materials provide an accessible way to introduce students to basic sketch study and archival methodologies within a popular music context. Based on in-class student reflections about the <em>Journals</em>, I suggest that the students’ sense of perceived closeness to these material artifacts not only helps them develop a greater appreciation for primary source studies, but also to assess publication of reproductions of musical artifacts and whether they promote or exploit the private lives of popular musicians.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Popular Music Performance as Pedagogical Artifact</p>
<p class="abs-author">Mandy Smith (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame/ Case Western Reserve University)</p>

<p>We often consider “the record” to be the primary source or artifact in popular music studies. But live performances can become living, breathing artifacts in the pop music classroom.</p>
<p>In this presentation, I use three categories of performance as pedagogical artifact at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to demonstrate their individual signifying power. The first two categories occur in our K-4 Meet the Instruments class. The class features a live demonstration about the drum kit’s construction, acoustics, and musical purpose, immediately followed by a Sheila E. drum solo video. The demonstration asks students to engage bodily and intellectually, while the video enables the demonstration to act as artifact by extension.</p>
<p>The third category includes newly recorded performances, such as the interactive artifact in our “Louder Than Words: Rock, Power, and Politics” exhibit. Rock Hall educators recorded four generically diverse versions each of well-known songs to teach museum visitors how musical affect can change musical meaning. Visitors can even combine the genres by selecting, say, metal drums and country vocals. Such recorded performances allow museum guests to experience—and even manipulate—musical affect in a more guided way than extant recordings permit.</p>
<p>As I tell students, everyone is an expert listener—we have all been listening to music our entire lives. But, as musicologists, it is our job to equip students with the tools and vocabulary to express this knowledge. At our best, we can deepen their understanding of—and relationship with—popular music’s history, sounds, and meanings.</p>

<p class="abs-title">eBay Musicology</p>
<p class="abs-author">Emily Gale (University of California, Merced)</p>

<p>My scholarship on sentimental song in the United States concerns music often overlooked by scholars in both musicology and popular music studies, and consequently also by librarians and archivists. This is music that is understood as too ordinary, too everyday to warrant serious study or consideration. In recent years, my research has been enriched immensely by the wide array of musical ephemera available for purchase on eBay, the online auction house. I have found eBay to be an endless treasure trove of resources that illustrate the degree to which popular music enters our lives as objects as well as performance. On a modest budget, I have collected Tin Pan Alley song sheets, mid-nineteenth century songsters, drink coasters decorated with song lyrics, pamphlets that were tucked into six packs of beer, songbooks, and satirical musical magazines—artifacts with significant research value, many of which I would have never discovered in a conventional archive. These objects—my growing personal museum of sentimental musical ephemera—have taught me to think about song as an ever-present aspect of day-to-day life in the context of US consumer culture. They also raise important questions about how music as a practice of everyday life intersects with concerns of race, class, and gender. In this presentation, I will share curiosities from my eBay-acquired collection as they pertain to my research on sentimental song in the United States and teaching of critical popular music studies in general.</p>
