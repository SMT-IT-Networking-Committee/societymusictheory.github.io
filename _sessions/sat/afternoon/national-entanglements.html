<p class="abs-title">Hubert Parry’s Dream of German Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Thomas Irvine (University of Southampton)</p>

<p>Hubert Parry (1848–1918) exerted profound influence on British musical life. He was the inaugural professor of music history at the Royal College of Music in 1882 and taught composition there before becoming Director in 1894. He held countless other offices, taught generations of musicians, and was one of the Britain’s most widely read popular authors on music.</p>
<p>Parry figures in most scholarly accounts of the period around 1900 as a primary protagonist of the “English Musical Renaissance.” This paper complicates this narrative by framing Parry’s trajectory in a transnational (German) context. Although he is remembered to today as the composer of such icons of English music as the hymn “Jerusalem” and the coronation anthem “I Was Glad,” Parry was in fact an ardent Germanophile. A leading English Wagnerite, he attended the first performances of the <em>Ring</em> in Bayreuth in 1876 and helped host Richard and Cosima Wagner during their visit to London in 1878. He wrote his only opera, <em>Guinevere</em> (1886), on a German text for performance in Stuttgart. In his writings Parry proposed an evolutionary model of music history in which German composers were the most advanced. He made every effort to model the British institutions for which he was responsible on German ones.</p>
<p>Mereion Hughes and Robert Stradling have argued that the “English Musical Renaissance” was driven in part by anxieties about the emergence of Germany as a military-industrial power. I take their argument further, in the spirit of Jürgen Osterhammel and Sebastian Conrad’s <em>Das Kaiserreich Transnational</em>, and suggest that Parry played the role of oracle for hegemonic discourses of German music. My point of departure is the Wagnerian oratorio <em>Prometheus</em> (1880), which also opens dialogues with Wagner’s polemical “other” Johannes Brahms, particularly the deeply national <em>Deutsches Requiem</em>. The main focus of my paper, however, is the RCM history curriculum, which Parry structured around the evolutionary superiority of German musical thought.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Italians Abroad: The Milan Exposition of 1906</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ditlev Rindom (University of Cambridge)</p>

<p>The 1906 Milan Exposition celebrated the completion of the Simplon Tunnel with a dedication to “Transport and the Fine Arts.” Given the recent nationalization of transport in Italy, the theme provided a well-timed opportunity to demonstrate the city’s cosmopolitanism and technological prowess, while also acknowledging the mobility and sophistication of contemporary aesthetic productions. The pavilion devoted to “Italians Abroad,” for example, highlighted both the global dissemination of Italian culture and the ever-growing number of Italians who were settling in cities across the Atlantic. Yet if the exposition’s international emphasis aimed to indicate Italy “climbing back with great effort to the magnitude of a nation” (as suggested by one report in <em>La Domenica della Sera</em>), attention to musical and human mobility nonetheless raised uncomfortable questions about cultural ownership and national pride, by interrogating claims of a unified Italian identity that were increasingly central to political rhetoric in the post-Risorgimento years. This paper examines the complex contemporary responses elicited by the Exposition within the context of wider debates around musical mobility and Italian nationalism in Milan at the time. Responding to recent scholarship that has addressed the status of emigration within post-unification Italy’s national psyche— alongside work on the politics of musical displays outside of Italy—I investigate the challenges posed in Italy by Italian music’s global presence, via a focus upon the exposition’s representations of New York and Buenos Aires: vital hubs of Italian immigration which by 1906 were also emerging as competing musical capitals. Notwithstanding the exhibition organizers’ assertions of the irreducible <em>italianità</em> of emigres and Italian opera alike, the accelerating rate of global emigration, the persistent popularity of Italian music abroad and the rise of performers firmly associated with the New World all destabilized any straightforward equations between music and nation. This paper thus reframes the role of music in constructing Italian identity in the post-unification era, by exploring the nexus of problems posed in Italy by “Italian” music abroad in its multiple forms and ethnicities, and more broadly by examining the values conferred upon diverse forms of movement and labour in the project to “make” Italians.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Measuring a Czech Ethnicity: Musicology, Race, and the (German) State</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kelly St. Pierre (Wichita State University)</p>

<p>A 2006 address by scholar Lubomír Tyllner celebrated the one hundred-year anniversary of the Czech Ethnological Institute (Etnologicky ústav), and so outlined its history beginning with its roots in musicological research. The Institute, Tyllner explained, was founded in 1905 as the Organizational Committee for Czech Song in Moravia and Silesia, was reinstated in 1919 as the State Committee for Folksong, and transformed to become the Department for Ethnography and Folklore Studies in 1954. Tyllner also paused to acknowledge three Institute members—Joseph Hutter, Bedřich Václavek, and Vladimír Helfert—killed either in concentration camps or Soviet prisons.</p>
<p>Tyllner’s history was wholly appropriate to the occasion and useful for reflecting the autonomy of today’s Czech Republic. It also omitted the Institute’s founding as part of the <em>Folksong in Austria Project</em> (<em>Das Volkslied in Österreich</em>), formulated by Viennese publisher Universal Edition; did not acknowledge the Institute’s production of Nazi-aligned research during the 1930s; and never recognized the death of German musicologist Gustav Becking during Czechoslovakia’s own postwar cleansing. That is, Tyllner offered a Czech history of a Czech institution—one nationalistically bent, but one also perhaps most ethically sound. As historian Tara Zahra points out, narratives drawing attention to the ways Czech musicologists participated alongside their German nationalist counterparts—narratives that grant agency to Czechs where they might have lacked it entirely—risk shaming history’s victims.</p>
<p>This paper examines the ethical maneuvering embedded in any Czech music historiography by exploring the ways Ethnological Institute scholarship aligned with German nationalist research through the beginning of the twentieth century. When the Institute began, participants like Leoš Janáček, Béla Bartók, and Zoltán Kodály used music research to geographically and biologically distinguish Germans from Czechs. Their methods and assumptions became radicalized in later members’ production of race studies, and arguments concerning “ethnogenesis”—supposedly racial musical traces—in Schubert’s works eventually even framing the deaths of musicologists Vladimír Helfert and Gustav Becking. Altogether, this examination reminds us that German and Czech musicologists shared in the same political landscapes, geographic spaces, scholarly conversations, and radicalized discourses through the beginning of the century. The consequences of this reminder also reveal Czech music studies today as analyzing not a stable, given repertoire, but part of still-unfolding negotiations of the twentieth-century’s traumas.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Bax’s <em>In Memoriam</em>: Memory, Martyrdom, and Modalities of Irishness</p>
<p class="abs-author">Aidan Thomson (Queen’s University, Belfast)</p>

<p>Composed in summer 1916, Arnold Bax’s <em>In Memoriam</em> is the earliest orchestral commemoration of the Easter Rising, the rebellion in Dublin in April 1916 that eventually led to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. Written in memory of the executed leader of the Rising, Patrick Pearse (whom Bax had met briefly a few years earlier), <em>In Memoriam</em> has been largely ignored by musicologists, partly because of its unusual performance history (the full score was lost for many years and the work premiered only in 1998) and partly because of the protean politics of its composer (a Briton sympathetic to Irish republicanism who later became Master of the King’s Music). In this paper, I argue that <em>In Memoriam</em> should be viewed, albeit retrospectively, as an important musical construction of Irish identity at the time of the Rising, and that it reflects Bax’s first-hand knowledge of (and sympathy with) nationalist-republican ideology through his acquaintance with leading members of the Irish Literary Revival.</p>
<p>Firstly, Bax stresses the continuity of the Rising with earlier rebellions by quoting the rebel song “Who Dares to Speak of Ninety-Eight?”, which recalls the Irish insurrection of 1798. Pearse is thereby assumed into the pantheon of dead Irish heroes, both historical and mythological (the latter through Bax’s recourse to the impressionist musical vocabulary of his Celtic-inspired early symphonic poems). Secondly, Bax’s adoption of the trope of the nineteenth-century funeral march emphasizes the centrality to radical Irish republicanism of martyrdom, something that Pearse had encouraged in his plays and poetry, and in public statements prior to the Rising. Thirdly, the presence of these themes and styles within the work’s ternary form hints at a narrative of resurrection: a commonplace in Irish historiography and literature since A. M. Sullivan’s <em>Story of Ireland</em> (1867). Consequently, the musical narrative of <em>In Memoriam</em> not only commemorates the events of the Rising but also mythologizes them: a process that occurred in (and through) many literary works over the next two decades, but which is unique in art music of the time.</p>
