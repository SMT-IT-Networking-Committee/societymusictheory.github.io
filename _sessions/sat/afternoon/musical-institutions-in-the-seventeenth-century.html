<p class="abs-title">The Chiesa di Santa Maria della Consolazione and Giovanni Legrenzi’s Early Venetian Career: 1671–77</p>
<p class="abs-author">Mollie Ables (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Shortly after taking permanent residence in Venice by 1670, Giovanni Legrenzi began contributing to the growing musical establishments at the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Consolazione, better known as the Fava Church. His time at the Fava coincided with the church’s first period as the center for oratorios in Venice, a time that also saw a marked increase in music for feast days. As a well-known composer, Legrenzi significantly contributed to the Fava’s increasing cultural relevance in the 1670s, and the church also afforded him connections and opportunities early in his Venetian career. The Venetian Senate granted the Congregation of the Oratory ownership of the Fava church in 1662 and, following the completion of the new oratory in 1667, the Fava became the main center for oratorios in Venice during the 1670s. Between 1671 and 1677, Legrenzi was regularly compensated for various services for the Fava church, mainly composing oratorios for the Lenten season. Payment records and lists of decrees from the period imply a narrative of when the Fava began to prioritize music administratively and financially. The number of musical personnel grew until 1677, when the church fathers abruptly suspended spending for music. In the following years, the Fava quickly re-emerged as an important musical center, particularly for oratorios. The musical activity of the 1670s, while Legrenzi was regularly composing for the church, set the precedent for the church as point of contact between larger musical establishments in Venice and aided Legrenzi’s entrance into the city’s musical culture.</p>
<p>Examining Legrenzi’s relationship with the Fava through unpublished archival documents reveals the operations of the institution when its role was changing in Venetian musical society. While the Fava benefited from Legrenzi’s contributions, Legrenzi also cultivated the professional connections the church afforded him in the 1670s and maintained a relationship with the Fava until his death in 1690. Tracing Legrenzi’s early activity at the Fava is crucial to understanding the role of the church in Venetian musical society, as well as how Legrenzi cultivated a successful Venetian career.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Privileged Dependency: The Legal and Social Position of Black Court Trumpeters in Seventeenth-Century Germany</p>

<p>Activities of black musicians in early modern Europe have so far received little scholarly attention, even though there is ample evidence of musical practices in the sizeable African diaspora of Portugal and Spain, countries heavily invested in the Atlantic slave trade. Perhaps surprisingly, black musicians were also present much further north, in German-speaking lands. <em>Hofmohren</em> (black court servants) appeared at German courts as early as the 1570s, and many of them were trained in a musical profession, especially as trumpeters and drummers. By the end of the seventeenth century, many large and medium-sized courts in the Empire, such as Brandenburg, Württemberg, Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, and Holstein-Gottorf, employed black trumpeters and drummers, using them for both ceremonial and military purposes.</p>
<p>Particularly their legal and social position within the court hierarchy and German society as a whole has been debated among historians. According to a frequently held view, black musicians, who had been bought on the international slave market and who had been sent as “gifts” to princely patrons, were considered free citizens and were fully integrated in German society, once they had officially entered court service. In the case of black trumpeters, their membership in the Imperial Trumpeters’ Guild (requiring proof of free birth) is usually cited as an argument for their free legal status.</p>
<p>In my paper I will complicate this view from the perspective of music sociology, by building on Lars E. Laubhold’s recent critical research on this guild, calling into question its legally binding character, and, particularly, by closely examining the lives of two black trumpeters, Christian Real (born ca. 1640, active at the Württemberg court) and Christian Gottlieb (died 1690, active in Schleswig-Holstein) as case studies. As my study of these little-known, yet well-documented careers seeks to demonstrate, the legal and social status of black musicians was far more fragile than that of their white colleagues. I will illustrate how this fragility becomes particularly apparent whenever they moved out of the courtly sphere, in which they were privileged and protected.</p>
