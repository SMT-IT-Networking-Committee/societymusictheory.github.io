<p class="abs-title">“Musicians Using Bizarre Sounds”: Charlotte Moorman’s New York Avant Garde Festival and Performance Art as Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Caitlin Schmid (Harvard University)</p>

<p>Best known for her controversial cello performances, Charlotte Moorman’s greatest contribution to the musical landscape of 1960s experimentalism was arguably her role as modern-day impresario of the fifteen nearly-annual New York Avant Garde Festivals (1963–80). The first of these was a simple six-concert series presenting contemporary composers; the Second Festival at Judson Hall headlined Karlheinz Stockhausen’s <em>Originale</em> (which features, among other things, a live chimpanzee); the Third added jazz, film, poetry, and dance nights; the Fourth relocated to Central Park; and by the Eighth Festival, the audience was treated to a twelve-hour extravaganza at the 67th Regiment Armory culminating in a performance of <em>The Second Coming of Charlotte Moorman</em>, in which the cellist and her instrument exploded out of a larger-than-life cake covered in fuchsia icing.</p>
<p>Moorman’s decision to develop the event from recital format to extravagant concert-cum-happening-cum-carnivale actively worked to blur the lines between music, art, and performance—and changing terminology in newspaper and magazine reviews reflected this crisis of category. Drawing on oral histories as well as archival documents from Northwestern University and the Getty Institute, I begin by tracing a detailed reception history of the New York Avant Garde Festival in order to explore how classifications of genre changed over the course of its many iterations. As one might expect, the question of whether or not this was a <em>music</em> festival grew thornier as the years went by. Nonetheless, I argue that there is value in studying both earlier and later Festivals—regardless of the way they were categorized by critics or audiences, regardless of the relative number of composer versus artist participants—through a musicological lens. To this end, I place Moorman’s Annual Avant Garde Festival in the context of other contemporaneous experimental music festivals such as Pauline Oliveros’s Tudorfest (1964) and the ONCE Group’s Here2 Festival (1965). Not only does this juxtaposition open up the space to highlight as-of-yet unstudied constellations of collaboration and influence, it also refocuses our attention on performance (in general) and sound (in particular) within the context of the festival medium.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Audiotopias and Remembrance in the Reception of Janet Cardiff’s <em>The Forty Part Motet</em> in New York City, 2001–14</p>

<p><em>The Forty Part Motet</em> is a sound installation by Canadian artist Janet Cardiff that “reworks” Thomas Tallis’ <em>Spem in alium</em> (c. 1570). In Cardiff’s installation, the separately recorded forty voice parts of the motet are played back via forty speakers shaping a large oval within the exhibition space and arrayed in eight groups of five, emulating the eight choirs of Tallis’ piece. With over fifty singlework shows worldwide and still in constant demand, Cardiff’s 2001 reworking of the Elizabethan motet enjoys unparalleled critical and popular success in sound art and the contemporary art scene at large.</p>
<p><em>40Part</em> was first shown in New York City on 14 October 2001, and the installation became a site of catharsis for MoMA PS1 visitors in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, inaugurating an enduring relationship between city and installation developed in seven further exhibitions. This paper traces the reception history of <em>40Part</em> in New York and places it vis-à-vis the psychosocial and urbanistic processes of restoration of the city after 9/11. Over the last fourteen years, Cardiff’s installation has accumulated meaning within the city’s rituals of remembrance and healing, serving to commemorate 9/11 (2001; 2011; 2012) and the recovery from Hurricane Sandy (2014). In its 2013 iteration at The Cloisters, <em>40Part</em> became a “sacred experience” of sorts that connected a remote, pleasant past with the visitors’ present. Like Cardiff’s reworking of <em>Spem in alium</em>, the Fuentidueña Chapel is a recent assemblage of variegated ancient remains, distributed so as to form a Romanesque-like whole. Smoothly and inaccurately, <em>40Part</em> too suggests the existence and the coming back of a stable and remote original motet. The trajectory of <em>40Part</em> across New York City is specific to the city’s needs, politics, and architectures of memory and erasure; the outstanding success of the piece worldwide, however, speaks to its generic character and timeliness. <em>40Part</em> effectively moves from one place to another while offering an acoustic cocoon to listeners. It couples mobility—of visitors, of the installation, and of its effects—with the privatization and individuation of acoustic space and experience in ways deeply attuned to twenty-first-century auditory culture.</p>
