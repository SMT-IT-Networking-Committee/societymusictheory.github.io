<p>What does a musicology career look like in the twenty-first century? This
session will convene musicologists working in the fields of forensic
musicology, fundraising development, digital education, and archival
preservation for a wide-ranging discussion about musicological careers both
within and beyond the traditional tenure track. Topics to be addressed will
include: how to stay engaged in musicology while pursuing careers beyond the
ivory tower; how Ph.D. programs can build skills applicable to both academic
and non-academic careers; what you can do to prepare for a wide array of
careers while working on your degree; and how we can reframe “non-traditional”
careers as something other than merely an alternative to academia. </p>
