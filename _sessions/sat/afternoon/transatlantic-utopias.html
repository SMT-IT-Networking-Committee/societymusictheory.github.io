<p class="abs-title">A Music Conservatory for the Blind? Francis Joseph Campbell’s American Dream</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Accinno (University of California, Davis)</p>

<p>When Samuel Howe first caught sight of Francis Campbell walking towards his house in Boston in 1857, he expressed amazement at the blind man’s high level of mobility. Walking unaided through the city streets, Campbell had come to the doorstep of Howe, the director of the Perkins Institute for the Blind, seeking employment as the school’s music teacher. In Campbell, Howe found a pedagogue whom he considered to be an ideal role model for his blind students. Manly and engaging, Campbell frowned upon any mention of “dependency” and throughout his life, expressed a desire to “show what a blind man can do.” Given carte blanche by Howe to train a cohort of pupils, Campbell placed nineteen out of twenty of the students in positions as organists, teachers, and piano tuners. Spurred on by these successes, the educator harbored a more ambitious dream: a national music conservatory for blind students. Campbell delivered a précis of his plan to the Harvard University Board of Supervisors in 1860. For an initial capital investment of $125,000, the conservatory would be attached to Harvard and allow blind students to immerse themselves both in musical training and general instruction at the university.</p>
<p>The proposed conservatory never reached fruition in the United States. Run ragged by the demands of a spouse in fading health and an unforgiving professional schedule, Campbell departed Boston in 1869 to pursue training at music conservatories in Leipzig and Berlin. During a visit to London in 1871, the Tennessean agreed to found the Royal Normal College and Academy of Music. Although pleased with the results of his English pupils, he frequently revisited the idea of an American conservatory for the blind in impassioned letters sent to friends and colleagues. Campbell’s imagined conservatory has long since been forgotten, the relic of a bygone era in which the social script of the blind musician reached its zenith. In recovering his advocacy efforts, I argue that Campbell helped to lay the groundwork for current disability rights activists who embrace the empowering benefits of education and who push to reimagine social and physical architecture for disabled citizens.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Afro-Wagnerism in Imperial London: Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s <em>Thelma</em> and the Endless Melody of Interracial Dreams</p>
<p class="abs-author">Samuel Dwinell (University of Akron)</p>

<p>By the time of his death in 1912, the black British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (b. 1875) was one of the most renowned writers of choral, orchestral, and chamber music in Britain. As well as enjoying the support of establishment figures such as Edward Elgar and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, Coleridge-Taylor participated in an emergent Pan-African political culture centered in London that involved black intellectuals from across the African diaspora, including the American writer and educator W. E. B. Du Bois. This black internationalism seized on London’s position at the heart of Empire to advocate and envision a more just future “beyond the color line” (in Du Bois’s words) of imperial modernity.</p>
<p>The rediscovery in 2003 of the score of Coleridge-Taylor’s opera <em>Thelma</em> (composed 1907–09) offers an opportunity to reassess the composer’s relation to transatlantic operatic culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Considered lost for almost a hundred years and never performed until 2012, <em>Thelma</em> dramatizes a pseudo-Nordic saga based on a popular Victorian novel by the British novelist Marie Corelli. As well as its Nordic subject matter, <em>Thelma</em>’s Wagnerian influences include prominent orchestral leitmotifs and a through-composed conception of text and song.</p>
<p>As I will argue, an analysis of <em>Thelma</em> provides new insights into how Wagnerism was put to use by black world-making practices in the early twentieth century. I situate the opera within a transnational black reception of Wagner that I call “Afro-Wagnerism”: an early twentieth-century black internationalism that saw and heard in Wagner’s operas the traces of a “dreamland” that would transcend the racial violence of anti-blackness (Du Bois’s 1903 <em>The Souls of Black Folks</em> is a seminal text). I also suggest how Coleridge-Taylor’s Wagnerism presages the middlebrow modernism that Christopher Chowrimootoo identifies within mid twentieth-century British opera. Building on Alex Ross’s recent discussion of “black Wagner,” studies of blackness and Wagnerism by Robert Gooding-Williams and Gayle Murchison, and scholarship on “black London” by historians such as Marc Matera, I conclude by arguing that <em>Thelma</em> pursues an interracial future that calls into question a widespread belief in the novelty of racial hybridity in the contemporary (twenty-first-century) transatlantic world.</p>
