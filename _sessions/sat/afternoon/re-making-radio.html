<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>These papers query the relevance of radio for musicology. In the golden age (1930s–40s) and postwar (1950s) eras, radio’s market saturation created a technological moment characterized by shared consumption and culture. Musicologists and media studies scholars have focused most of their attention on the important cultural work accomplished by radio broadcasts during these decades, in locales such as the UK (Doctor, Baade), the U.S. (Douglas, Hilmes, Smulyan), and West Germany (Beal, Currid). The four papers in this session probe the relationships among broadcasting, institutional funding, subcultures, and economies. Spanning the golden age to the present, they reveal why radio is still an important area of scholarly inquiry. Together the papers show why radio remains critically important. In connection with sound-studies scholars (Katz, Sterne, Kahn), presenters investigate the cultural impacts of changing radio technologies. They also engage with science-and-technology studies scholars (Pinch, Latour), focusing as much attention on consumers, economies, and institutional priorities as on broadcasts and content. These papers show there is much to be gained by analyzing radio’s various facets: broadcasting, but also audiences and institutional supports; advertising, but also political economy, cultural capital, and technologies of surveillance.</p>

<p class="abs-title"><em>Your Hit Parade</em> and the Soundscape of Standards</p>
<p class="abs-author">Brian Kane (Yale University)</p>

<p>In the era when the so-called Great American Songbook was in formation— spanning from the early 1930s until the mid-1950s—songs circulated in numerous performances and instances across diverse media, such as film, recording, radio, and sheet music. Yet, among them all, radio held a privileged place in distributing popular song. Successful programs (like the <em>Kraft Music Hall</em> with Bing Crosby) would often reach nearly fifty million listeners weekly. Since legislation limited the broadcast of commercial recordings on the radio—and also due to the strong intervention of the American Federation of Musicians—most of music heard on the radio at this time was performed live, undergoing constant re-arrangement by various performers. In this “media soundscape” there was often no version of a song necessarily considered by audiences to be the original or first, since all versions simultaneously competed for attention and sales.</p>
<p>As a way of addressing the auditory cultural conditions associated with this soundscape and, in particular, its implications for the ontology of music, I focus upon the popular radio program <em>Your Hit Parade</em>. Beginning in mid-1935, the show presented the top hits of the week, compiling sales from all domains of music production (recording, sheet music, radio, and jukeboxes) into a list of America’s hit songs. The show remained popular for almost two decades, eventually crossing over to television, until its demise in mid-1958. <em>Your Hit Parade</em> provides an illuminating case study for a three reasons. First, it covers almost the entirety of period in which the Great American Songbook was in formation. Second, songs that remained on the hit parade week after week were re-arranged, and thus offer a glimpse into the practice of constant adaptation that was typical of the era. Third, the show famously ended in the age of rock and roll; not coincidentally, this is when a shift in the production and consumption of popular music meant that songs became uniquely attached to particular hit recordings. Thus, the study of <em>Your Hit Parade</em> helps to articulate a historical shift in the ontology of music—from “songs” to “recordings” and from “standards” to “covers.”</p>

<p class="abs-title">Beyond Darmstadt: Radio and the West German New-Music Ecology</p>

<p>In postwar West Germany, a state-sponsored network of radio stations played an enormous role in cultural reconstruction (Badenoch 2008; Beal 2003 and 2006). This paper examines the numerous ways in which radio created vital institutional supports for a burgeoning new-music ecology. I begin by asking how powerful impresarios within various West German broadcasting stations, such as RIAS (Berlin), SWF (Baden-Baden), and WDR (Cologne), nurtured a range of new music initiatives including broadcasts, concerts, and special festivals. Even at the local-regional level, new music offerings fed a subterranean Cold War competition for notoriety and cultural capital. This ecology diversifies the Darmstadt-centric perspective that has so far dominated mid-century scholarship (Beal 2006; Borio and Danuser 1997; Grant 2001; Iddon 2013).</p>
<p>The paper then turns to a case study: How did the activities of the WDR make Cologne a formidable center for new music (<em>Am Puls der Zeit</em> 2006; Custodis 2004; Hilberg and Vogt 2002)? Using archival documents, I first examine the <em>Musik der Zeit</em> concert series. I summarize the range of repertoire that was played and its immediate critical reception in the press, and show how performers and composers were paid. Second, also synthesizing archival research, I summarize the content of Herbert Eimert’s notorious <em>Musikalisches Nachtprogramm</em>. Eimert’s popular bi-weekly new music broadcast is frequently cited as a major influence upon the pan-European avant-garde: “Anyone who was anyone was listening” (Iddon 2013, 228). But who could have been listening? I establish the literal reach of the Cologne broadcasting tower, as well as the scope, breadth, and depth of the repertoire and topics that Eimert and his collaborators discussed. In sum, this paper shows that the WDR provided crucial financial and institutional support for a wide range of new music initiatives—live concerts, dedicated broadcasts, and one of the first electronic music studios—which worked in tandem to produce a vibrant new-music scene in Cologne. Furthermore, this case study can spur us to think more deeply about the role that radio institutions played in sustaining the new music scene in Italy, France, Japan, and the U.S.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Broadcast Sound as Cultural and Natural Resource: Indigenous Music, Community Radio, and Ecological Activism in the Peruvian Andes</p>
<p class="abs-author">Joshua Tucker (Brown University)</p>

<p>It has been decades since AM radio ceded its central place in the media-scape of the Global North, first to FM music broadcasters, and later to various television and online streaming services. However, institutions broadcasting on the AM band remain pivotal elsewhere, particularly in relation to activities that lie outside the purview of commercial music broadcasting. Community AM stations play a particularly central role in carving out spaces for the maintenance and shaping of musical traditions otherwise considered peripheral, especially where underdevelopment or geographic complexity disfavors more technologically sophisticated media forms. In this presentation, I describe how two Peruvian organizations have shaped the relations between sound practice, ethnic identity, and ecological knowledge in rural-indigenous communities around the Andean city of Ayacucho, through the far-reaching power of AM radio.</p>
<p>I focus first on a moment in the 1980s, when an organization called the <em>Centro de Capacitación Campesino</em> (Center for Peasant Training, CCC) was founded at Ayacucho’s national university, amid the extreme violence unleashed locally by the Shining Path’s war against the Peruvian state. The CCC’s broadcasts provided young indigenous musicians with unprecedented access to publicity and resources with which to disseminate their music. Created by Quechua-speaking peasants, who were able to carry borrowed recorders into zones of violence unreachable by university-based professionals, its programs fostered an unprecedented indigenous music scene for performers eager to attain local renown, and also left an informal cassette archive of rural sounds.</p>
<p>The program ceased transmission within the decade, but its recordings attained a second life after 2000, when a community station run by the former CCC target community of Quispillaccta began coordinating operations with an indigenous-rights nonprofit. Drawing upon the CCC’s archive, the new station made old recordings of the town’s <em>chimaycha</em> music into a centerpiece of its broadcasts, and a symbol of indigenous ecological rationality. I describe how they brought <em>chimaycha</em> to engage the transnational environmentalist discourses. Furthermore, reinventions of the CCC allow local actors to mediate contemporary politics of ethnicity and ecological thought through radio, bringing local musicians and listeners to resonate with the global indigenous movement.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Music as a Technology of Surveillance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Eric Drott (University of Texas at Austin)</p>
<p>This paper explores questions of music use, commodification, and online surveillance resulting from radio’s remediation in online streaming services (Moscote Freire 2007). Key catalysts in the transition from ownership- to access-based models of music distribution—services like Pandora, Spotify, Deezer, and others— have positioned themselves as a means whereby listeners may be reintegrated into a “digital enclosure” (Andrejevic 2007), a space over which rights holders can exercise greater control. Yet online streaming’s promise of re-monetizing musical commodities previously de-monetized by practices of file sharing (Sterne 2012) has been called into doubt by difficulties in converting users of advertising-based “freemium” services into paying subscribers. This has impelled Pandora, Spotify, and others to develop alternative means of extracting value from users. Streaming sites have thus transformed into enterprises whose business is not only the sale of music-related services, but relies increasingly upon the collection, aggregation, and exchange of user data (Anderson 2013; Morris 2015).</p>
<p>A key issue this paper pursues concerns the changing status of music within the commercial strategies of online streaming. While previous research has indicated how various features, functionalities, and interfaces serve to distinguish competing services (Morris and Powers 2015), less attention has been paid to the way they position themselves vis-à-vis other new media companies also trading in user data and user-commodities. Notable in this respect is how music figures into marketing campaigns directed not at consumers, but at prospective advertisers and investors. Close examination of music’s representation in such marketing discourse underlines how it too has been transformed by the logic of user monitoring and commodification. Such discourse casts music as a medium that offers streaming services, advertisers, and data brokers privileged access to listeners’ innermost selves. But it also casts music as an ideal tracking device, pervading our everyday lives, insinuating itself into any and every activity, and accompanying individuals across the social, physical, and geographical spaces they traverse. In this way, the very attributes that make music so powerful as a “technology of the self” (DeNora 2000) facilitate its transformation into an equally powerful technology of surveillance.</p>
