<p class="abs-title">Outlining a Phenomenology of Ethics: Moral Failures in the Listening Practices of an Artificially Intelligent “Free” Improviser</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ritwik Banerji (University of California, Berkeley)</p>

<p>Over the past half century, collective free improvisation has been discursively constructed as the translation of the pursuit of socio-political freedom into the practice of unrestricted, non-hierarchical musical interaction (Cardew 1971, Smith 1973, Bailey 1980). Whereas in other musical practices performers must constrain their impromptu playing to conventions of genre or composition, free improvisers are (supposedly) at liberty to spontaneously contribute to, or obstruct, the ongoing musical moment with any sonic materials within their reach.</p>

<p>Implicitly, this ideological commitment to musical freedom produces a tacitly accepted moral order which governs non-musical social interactions between performers: thou shalt not openly criticize the playing of one’s peers. After all, if this practice offers musical freedom, it would be rude to tell someone how they ought to have played.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, players clearly have opinions, expectations, and desires for how their peers should listen and respond to them in the course of improvised musical interaction. The halcyon vision of free improvisation as a practice free of such normativities rapidly falls apart as improvisers engage with interactive music systems designed to listen and respond in the manner of a fellow free improviser. Though such systems often commit the same socio-musical errors as their human counterparts (e.g. playing too loudly, interrupting other’s musical ideas, etc.), human performers feel no hesitation in disclosing their disgust at how such systems offend them and fail to satisfy their expectations for interpersonal conduct in the course of musical interaction.</p>
<p>In this paper, I discuss my experience in the design and testing of such systems with improvisers in Berlin’s Echtzeitmusik scene of free improvisation over the past several years. I argue that the failures of socio-musical interactive abilities that players identify in my systems offer an outline of the phenomenological demands of ethical conduct in this practice of socio-musical interaction. Specifically, such critiques indicate, with a level of clarity glossed over in previous scholarship on free improvisation, how players expect others to engage with them in putatively “free” improvisation in terms of specific practices of listening, thinking, and physical action in musical interaction.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Composing within the Lines, Working behind the Scenes: Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, and Dick Vance’s Arrangements for <em>At the Bal Masque</em> (1958)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Darren LaCour (Lindenwood University)</p>

<p>The 1958 studio album <em>Duke Ellington, His Piano, and His Orchestra At the Bal Masque</em> features the Ellington band performing decades-old Tin Pan Alley classics under the guise of a supper club orchestra. Presented as a concert recording of the band’s set from its engagement at the Americana Hotel in Miami Beach—complete with canned applause before and after each track—the album fits alongside Ellington’s more ambitious concept albums with Columbia Records in the late-1950s, such as <em>Such Sweet Thunder</em> and <em>A Drum Is a Woman</em>. Critics and historians have largely dismissed <em>At the Bal Masque</em> because of its “light” fare and lack of original material, but the present paper argues that Ellington and his writing partner Billy Strayhorn insisted on adding compositional touches to even these arrangements. Their compositional thinking appears as “sonic signatures,” which I define as brief segments of music not present in the source material, but also through the arrangers’ handling of the formal structure and instrument combinations. These arrangements provide valuable insights into the composers’ working processes.</p>
<p>In the second part of the paper, I investigate a third, unrecognized contributor to the album’s arrangements: trumpeter Dick Vance. Other researchers have identified Vance as the arranger for “The Peanut Vendor” as it appears on <em>At the Bal Masque</em>, but archival evidence from the Duke Ellington Collection at the Smithsonian Archives Center demonstrates that Vance likely contributed two additional arrangements for the album: “Satan Takes a Holiday” and “Got a Date with an Angel.” I compare handwriting samples and point to financial records to substantiate my claims.</p>
<p>In sum, the paper disrupts two common assumptions about the Ellington band: first, that Ellington’s arrangements of others’ compositions do not merit the same scrutiny as his original work, and second, that Ellington and Strayhorn provided all of the material that the band performed. I demonstrate that much about Ellington and Strayhorn’s compositional process can be gleaned from their arrangements while also revealing that, behind the scenes, Ellington’s collaborators extended beyond his established circle of band members.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Earwitnessing Jazz and the Leonard Feather Blindfold Tests</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lucille Mok (Chicago, Ill.)</p>

<p>Over a period of three decades beginning in the 1950s, jazz critic Leonard Feather prompted colorful commentary and heated discussion by such prominent musicians as Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and Mary Lou Williams, among many others. They were responding to Feather’s “Blindfold Tests,” in which Feather played unidentified recordings, prompting reflections on the performances and attempts to identify the performers based on musical style. Featured on his radio show, as well as columns in <em>Down Beat</em> and <em>Metronome</em>, the tests were designed in an effort to expose prevalent racial stereotypes within the jazz community. Over forty-one interviews, Feather’s tests elicited responses that were sometimes surprising and always entertaining.</p>
<p>In this paper, I examine select archival recordings of the Blindfold Tests from The Leonard Feather Jazz Collection at the University of Idaho, presenting evidence that the tests provided a forum for the voice of artists in discussions on music and race in the jazz community. Feather’s interviews reveal contradictory ideas within the jazz community, while certain themes also emerge by analyzing them as a collection. In conclusion, I suggest that the series was more than a novelty act, but initiated important discussions within the jazz community. They revealed not only perceptions of gender and race stereotypes, but also uncovered insights into expectations of white and black jazz artists, respectively.</p>
<p>Some scholars have questioned the role of mainstream critics such as Feather as record-keepers of jazz history. In 1960, for instance, Amiri Baraka famously noted the dominance of white middle class male voices within critical jazz discourse. This research acknowledges and critiques the critic’s role within jazz discourses, while it also complements recent jazz research on figures previously considered auxiliary players in jazz history. It also contributes to recent discussions, facilitated by David Ake, Charles Hiroshi Garrett, and Daniel Goldmark, on the ontology of jazz and its players. Alluding to Feather’s self-identification as an “earwitness” of jazz history, I argue that his invitation to listen and reflect on musical performances involved jazz artists in the writing of their own histories.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Recent Jazz Arrangements of Western Art Music as Foreignized Translations</p>
<p class="abs-author">J. Cole Ritchie (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>Toward the end of the twentieth century, jazz musicians began to arrange works from the Western classical canon in a new way. Whereas earlier arrangers isolated popular classical melodies and adapted them to jazz performance practices, musicians such as Uri Caine, Dave Douglas, and The Bad Plus retain substantial elements of the original composition’s musical material and form. In performance they then refract the material through the eclectic selection of styles, instrumentations, and improvisatory resources available to modern jazz musicians. The resulting arrangements defamiliarize the listening experience for jazz and classical audiences alike. A close examination nonetheless shows that their idiosyncratic, occasionally even outlandish arranging decisions consistently respond to characteristic formal, stylistic, and orchestrational aspects of the source work, mirroring and magnifying them in the new medium.</p>
<p>In this respect, these arrangements correspond to the principles and aims of a tradition of literary translation known as “foreignization.” Standard Englishlanguage translation methods shape—or “domesticate”—their source texts to the constructions and procedures of English, not unlike earlier “swingin’-the-classics” models of jazz arrangement. A foreignizing translation approximates the syntactic and formal properties of the foreign text within the receiving language. This practice—first articulated by early German romantics Goethe and Schleiermacher and more recently explored by translation theorists Antoine Berman and Lawrence Venuti—expands the expressive capabilities of the receiving language by using constructions and forms from a different language. In addition, foreignizing translators purposefully employ a heterogeneous vocabulary to call attention to the author’s original word choice. This play of linguistic registers is analogous to the interaction of diverse jazz-influenced musics in these arrangements. In both cases, the result is a translation that conveys an author’s distinctive style to a new audience by accentuating the characteristics that made the original work significant in its own tradition.</p>
<p>Using the metaphor of foreignizing translation, I examine jazz arrangements of works by Mahler, Stravinsky, and Webern to clarify how these arrangements communicate the unique qualities of a classical composition to a jazz audience and also how jazz expression is enriched through confrontation with a separate musical tradition.</p>
