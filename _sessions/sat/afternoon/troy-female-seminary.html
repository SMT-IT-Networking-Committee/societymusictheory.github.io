<h2>Notes</h2>


<p>From its inception in 1821, Troy Female Seminary (Troy, New York), now Emma Willard School, garnered a renowned reputation for its academic and music education. Recognized as one of the first institutions in the United States to offer an education for young women that was comparable to that available for young men, Troy’s curriculum, which included music, surpassed that promoted at the finishing schools. Nineteenth-century educators contended that the study and practice of music had mental, emotional, and physical benefits that were on a par with those of many academic areas. Students were challenged to develop their talents singing intermediate to advanced literature and had opportunities to perform a wide range of genres at semi-professional concerts held throughout the academic year. Faculty members occasionally participated in the performances, making it possible for the students to perform repertoire that included parts for male voices.</p>
<p>In my lecture, I will identify the genres, level of difficulty, and composers of vocal music that formed the repertoire performed on Seminary concert programs from 1838 to 1872. The Edgecliff Vocal Ensemble from Xavier University (Cincinnati, Ohio), with faculty soloists Erin Keesy and Thomas Dreeze, conducted by Dr. Richard Schnipke, will offer representative examples. A literary and performance collaboration will reveal the significance of vocal music in the education of young women at a groundbreaking female institution, whose practices and curriculum would serve as models for other schools. In addition, this lecture recital will affirm that the students were trained to sing repertoire beyond the level of parlor music for amateurs.</p>
