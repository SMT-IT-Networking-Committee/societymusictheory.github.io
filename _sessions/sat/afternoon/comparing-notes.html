<p class="abs-title">A Well-Tuned History of the Music of the World: Helmholtz’s Investigation into the Material Conditions of Hearing</p>
<p class="abs-author">Julia Kursell (University of Amsterdam)</p>

<p>In the preface to his treatise <em>On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music</em>, first published in 1863, Hermann von Helmholtz thanked his sponsors for their unusual support: “The following investigations could not have been accomplished without the construction of new instruments, which did not enter into the inventory of a Physiological Institute, and which far exceeded in cost the usual resources of a German philosopher.” This held in particular for his “Harmonium in perfectly natural intonation” that was financed by the Senckenbergsche naturforschende Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>This instrument was meant to allow an investigation into the physiological nature of hearing, yet this was based upon an important assumption. Helmholtz claimed that the way in which humans hear is not given by nature, but learned through contact with the music and instruments they encounter during their lifetime. This enabled him to understand the history of music as a reservoir of experimental knowledge. What would people hear if they did not use the standard instrument of his own time, the piano? To answer this question, Helmholtz scrutinized the available knowledge about music history world wide, and he tested his assumption about the functioning of the musical ear under different conditions at his harmonium.</p>
<p>In this series of investigations, the harmonium became an acoustic <em>passe-partout</em> for all kinds of music. Given Helmholtz’s speculations about the essentially mathematical nature of sounds and tone relations, this instrument was a practical and, at the same time, precise tool for rendering these speculations audible. This paper will discuss how Helmholtz’s own practice of hearing was an open and somewhat vulnerable process in which he himself learned to hear in new ways and listen to previously non-existing sounds while arguing that, at the same time, Helmholtz’s method was to provide a powerful model for future researchers to reassess music according to new, “better” or “correct” tuning systems.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Emancipating Microtones: Nineteenth-Century Experiments with 53-Tone Equal Temperament</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel Walden (Harvard University)</p>

<p>In her 1851 treatise <em>Acht Briefe [. . .]</em>, music theorist, novelist, and political revolutionary Johanna Kinkel included a rather startling call-to-arms: “Emancipirt die Vierteltöne, so habt ihr eine neue Tonwelt!” Proposing that Chopin’s “unerhörte” melodies gained power from their structural organization around hidden quarter-tone relationships, Kinkel proposed a liberatory future where all “Klang-Atome” can contribute equally to compositional structure and microtones could be used to imitate the subtlety of “eternal nature.”</p>
<p>Kinkel’s arguments anticipated experimental keyboard technologies that featured as many as fifty-three equally tempered divisions of the octave in approximation of the “natural,” “pure,” and scientifically “proven” intervals of just intonation. This paper will offer a history of the 53 ETS system in England and Germany, focusing on R. H. M. Bosanquet’s “generalized keyboard” (1876) and Tanaka Shôhei’s “enharmonium” (1890). Bosanquet proposed his instrument for the performance of non-Western scales including Indian rāgas, whereas Tanaka argued his enharmonium could restore the sonorous glory Western music enjoyed before twelve-note equal temperament. The merits of the enharmonium were exhibited in a pedagogical album where annotations to canonical works revealed how certain pitches would be altered within a just-intonation framework to maximize consonance. Musicians could enjoy physically distinct sensations between what were previously enharmonic equivalents, opening a new sonorous field as Kinkel desired.</p>
<p>The 53-note system played an essential role in the development of comparative musicology and music theory. Bosanquet and Tanaka’s methods for calculating interval relations of both Western and non-Western scale systems influenced Alexander J. Ellis’ efforts to establish cents as an objective metric to quantify pitch. Schenker was aware of the 53 ETS system and suggested early in his career, like Kinkel, that Chopin was grasping at microtonal variations of the pitches printed in the score by alluding to the seventh overtone. His later “discovery” of the essential diatony of deep background musical structures, however, depended on excluding non-diatonic pitches that were understood as effeminate and non-German. I propose that music theorists and ethnomusicologists alike could benefit from reconsidering the racial and gendered subtexts of these often-overlooked historical narratives in order to better understand the origins of the analytical practices they espouse.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Tanaka Shôhei’s Quixotic Quest for Just Intonation and Pure Ears</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jonathan Service (University of Oxford)</p>

<p>In 1884, Tanaka Shôhei—a Japanese polymath who was to publish two epochal musical monographs that framed his career like bookends—arrived at the University of Berlin to study in the laboratory of Hermann von Helmholtz. As he records in <em>Junseichô hatsuan no dôki</em> (1937), at his first interview with his advisor, Helmholtz told him that, yes, the Japanese must evolve and change with the times, and their music must adapt to the modern world, but “Do not,” Helmholtz can be heard to thunder in Tanaka’s recollection, “allow the ears of your people to be corrupted by the system of equal temperament.” Tanaka took this advice to heart, publishing in 1890 his dissertation <em>Studien im Gebiete der reinen Stimmung</em> which contained a theorization of what he called 53-tone “just intonation.”</p>
<p>Tanaka’s convictions put him on a collision course with the most influential person on the music scene in Japan at the time, Isawa Shûji. In correspondence with Alexander J. Ellis (identified as Mr. T.), Tanaka quibbled with Isawa’s claims. Whereas Isawa insisted on the universality of the basic building blocks of music both East and West—“There is not the least bit of difference between the twelve tones of the East and the West”: this is the determined <em>ostinato</em> of Isawa’s <em>Report of the Commission of Musical Investigations</em> (1884)—Tanaka was keen to delineate the difference between the tempered system achieving dominance in Europe and the pure intonation he held to be prevalent in Japan.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, there was a certain commonality of purpose between Isawa and Tanaka—the dream of a cohesive, national music, which would respond to the challenge posed by modernity while remaining true to the cultural traditions of the archipelago. This common purpose set them at odds with the predominant trend at the turn of the century in Japan, which was towards a bifurcation of the field: “traditional” music (performed, Tanabe Hisao, prewar Japan’s most influential musicologist, averred, in “pure intonation”) over and against Western music and its techno-scientific twelve tone equal division of the octave.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Ambivalent Ethics of Comparative Musicology: A Japanese Case Study</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benjamin Steege (Columbia University)</p>

<p>Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and Otto Abraham’s “Studies on the Tone System and Music of the Japanese” (1903) is an exemplary representative of early comparative musicology, synthesizing all that would have been seen as compelling about the nascent discipline. In addition to showcasing a modernist ethos of precision and authenticity in the aspiration to make present the sheer acoustic sensation of unfamiliar music, the text also displays philological flair, historical erudition, and an ethnological sensitivity unusual for its time. But from a broader perspective, beyond merely expanding the scope of discourse for its own sake, what exactly did the two Berlin psychologists, Hornbostel and Abraham, aim to accomplish with this document?</p>
<p>Whatever the now seemingly self-evident significance of comparative musicology in the history of music studies, the underlying impulses that motivated this research agenda remain little understood. Recent interpretations have viewed it as motivated variously by a desire to construct an evolutionary, race-hierarchical narrative of music, by the dissemination of recording technology, and by the need of colonial expansion for cultural knowledge of any kind that might aid the administration of new populations. Valid as these assessments are, this paper argues that to grasp the central, unstated project of early comparative musicology additionally requires an evaluation of the fundamentally <em>psychologistic</em> character of this discourse, and of the ethical potential the new psychology was thought to bring.</p>
<p>Although a text as ethnologically rich as “Music of the Japanese” may appear to anticipate a cultural turn in anthropology, “culture” as such was in fact precisely what these authors sought to bracket out in order to isolate the supposedly underlying psychological truths that culture, with its arbitrary conventions, would otherwise obscure. Cultural description exists in order to be exorcized, on the belief that the “psychological” was a higher sphere transcending other forms of difference and giving the lie to polygenist racial theories. Yet Hornbostel’s tacit insistence on the foundational significance of raw psychological apprehension was also a weakness insofar as it did not provide an adequate grounding for personhood, and thus left the project open to the very race-thinking it otherwise resisted.</p>
