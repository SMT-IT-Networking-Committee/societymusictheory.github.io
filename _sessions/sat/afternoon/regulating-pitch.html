<p class="abs-title">Internal and External Factors of <em>Seicento</em> Modal Conventions</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Dodds (University of North Carolina School of the Arts)</p>

<p>Seventeenth-century modal theory is notorious for its lack of consensus on matters of terminology and classification. The dominant system of modal classification in Catholic Europe, the <em>tuoni ecclesiastici</em> arising from the organ’s role in psalmody, was particularly lambasted for its lack of theoretical cogency and confusion with the <em>modi</em>. What, then, accounts for its origins and dominance?</p>
<p>New research indicates that the <em>tuoni</em> arose not from organ-choir <em>alternatim</em> practice as such but from the introduction of <em>basso per organo</em> parts to vocal polyphony in the mid 1590s. Once this occurred, market forces dictated notation of these parts in the keys of actual performance. The keys themselves resulted from the interplay of internal factors concerning traditions of modal labeling, notated transposition level, and performance practices. That they acquired such force of convention (used in labeling many thousands of works and described in some forty Baroque treatises) is due to a convergence of statistically demonstrated external factors. The <em>Pax Hispanica</em> won by the Peace of Câteau Cambrésis in 1559 brought a half century of economic growth to the Italian peninsula. Music printing rose meteorically; Venetian music publishers dominated the European market. Borne on a tide of post-Tridentine piety, Office music surged in popularity, surpassing Mass imprints as much as threefold. Italian printers’ reliance on moveable type, ill suited for the notational complexities of motets in <em>stile moderno</em>, advantaged the conservative styles favored for psalms and canticles, the genres most strongly associated with the <em>tuoni</em>. Synthesizing the author’s own data with studies by Kurtzman and Morelli on performance practices and recent analysis of music printing trends by Rose, Tuppen, and Drosopoulou, this paper demonstrates that economics, religion, publishing trends, printing technology, and musical style played mutually reinforcing roles in establishing the seventeenth century’s dominant system of modal classification.</p>

<p>Although commonly adopted as the point of reference for musicians in the Western world, “A” 440hz only became the standard pitch during an international conference held in London in 1939. The adoption of this norm was the result of decades of international negotiations launched in Stuttgart in 1834, involving a surprisingly dynamic mix of actors. If performers first raised the cry for musical standardization, composers were quick to follow in order to assert their authority in the field of aesthetics. At the same time, instrument builders’ participation in the negotiations revealed the stakes that standardization held for the sale of their products internationally, while physicists’ motivations were engendered by a scientific faith in being able to rationally determine the most accurate pitch for performance. Finally, representatives of different state ministries showed themselves eager to impose their nation’s norms as a sign of their cultural and scientific superiority.</p>
<p>While the history of reference pitch has been thoroughly documented from the perspective of performance practice, “the story of A” has remained underexplored as a historical, social, and political process, a lacuna that is surprising when compared to the rich historiography dedicated to similar processes of stabilization in the fields of sociology and history of science. Drawing on a broad corpus of archival materials and texts documenting both the negotiations and the debates surrounding the definition of A, my paper aims to recover the significance of this crucial process in the history of music. Which actors and countries were empowered in the negotiations? What were the procedures that finally led to the decision made by the 1939 London conference? Through what other settings and means besides official conferences were countries able to advance their claims on fixing the global diapason pitch? By answering such questions, this paper demonstrates the political, technological, scientific, and aesthetic contingencies underlying the historical construction of one of the most “natural” and seemingly stable objects of contemporary musical performance, itself the result of a cacophony of competing views and interests. In so doing, this project charts the changing maps of forces in charge of literally tuning the world.</p>
