<p>The theme of this panel will be teaching outside oneâ€™s primary professional
and/or scholarly area and the evolving expectations and needs of the musicology
academic job market. For many musicologists on the market today that includes
the teaching of world, popular, or vernacular music, and we are hoping to
address fresh, constructive ways of preparing prospective collegiate faculty to
more effectively teach students to experience music, musicians, and the social
and cultural contexts of repertories that might not be close to their research
or training. This panel will address practical concerns related to this topic
including undergraduate syllabus design, course preparation, NASM requirements,
strategies for locating departmental allies and resources, and how the growing
expectation for teaching outside the Western tradition is shaping the
musicology job market.</p>
