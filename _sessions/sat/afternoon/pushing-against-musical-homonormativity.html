<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>In the era of post-marriage equality, Ellen, and <i>RuPaul’s Drag Race</i>,
once-maligned and underground queer cultures have become mainstream through
the tireless work of political, legal and cultural activists who fought for
recognition, equality, and protection rights. Despite increasing acceptance of
LGBTQ lives, especially among younger generations, queer theorists,
commentators, and artists have pointed out the risks in assimilating within
the larger heteronormative culture in a process that Lisa Duggan (2003) calls
homonormativity, whereby queer voices are silenced in exchange for privileges
that society had previously denied them.</p>

<p>What gets lost in the transition to homonormativity are queer histories and
lineages, particularly those that were interrupted due to the losses from the
AIDS epidemic. This trauma abruptly silenced a generation of queer voices, and
precipitated the adoption of homonormative ideals that served as survival
techniques (Schulman 2012). As a result, queers are often left with lacunae,
further compounded by an archive that neglects queer lives and desires. This
past must be carefully reclaimed, reconstructed, and reimagined from within
the community (Dyer 2005, Bronski 2011), so as not to be co-opted and
commodified for neoliberal purposes and the cultural capital that
heteronormative ideals can gain from it.</p>

<p>Homonormativity enters into the musical conversation when queer composers
and performers are forced to adopt musicking practices that fail to interface
with their sexuality. Dominant (heteronormative) music practices, including
performance presentation, composer-performer relationships, ontologies of the
score, formal design, and other musical concerns, can be queered when one
actively attempts to resist the enticements of encroaching homonormativity.
Queerly oriented musicians must develop tools of resistance to protect and
cultivate their practices which are derived by looking backwards in order to
fashion a future (Love 2007, Muñoz 2009). </p>

<p>Percussion is an unstable category, at once understood as an ever-expanding
collection of instruments, a practice that is post-instrumental (Stene 2014),
and an action-centered practice (Schick 2006); much like “queer,” “percussion”
is a slippery term that avoids easy categorization (Hennies 2017).
Percussion’s queer history (Solomon 2016) aligns closely with American
experimental practices, providing a context for further research in queer
percussion performance. This provides an opening, allowing investigations into
what it means to make queer-labeled music (Goldberg 2016), and how unexpected
acts of artistic mayhem can disrupt the status quo (Halberstam 2012).
Percussion is uniquely situated as an instrumental practice to engage and
embody queer issues directly, hence the need for examining the queer potential
in percussive performance.</p>

<p>This lecture-recital seeks to highlight various strategies that develop out
of the queer percussion repertoire as a way to resist homonormativity. Works
by Cage (<i>One4</i>, 1990, two realizations played concurrently) and Oliveros
(excerpt from <i>Arctic Air</i>, 1992, spatially realized throughout the
audience) serve as reminders of radical queer statements that focus on the
liberation of sound, while Sarah Hennies’ (b. 1979) <i>Settle</i> (2012) is an
example of music that avoids a homonormative paradigm through the exploration
of a single repeated chord. Further, Pergolesi and Solomon will simultaneously
perform compositions of their own, putting into practice their theories of
queer resistance. </p>
