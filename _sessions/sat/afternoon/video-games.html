<p class="abs-title">The Sounds in the Machine: Hirokazu Tanaka’s Cybernetic Soundscape for Metroid</p>
<p class="abs-author">William Gibbons (Texas Christian University)</p>

<p>A radical departure from the colorful, lighthearted video games typically associated with the Nintendo Entertainment System, the science-fiction game <em>Metroid</em> (1986) falls into a category of late twentieth-century sci-fi that addresses deep cultural anxieties regarding blurring boundaries between humanity and technology. Both its protagonist and antagonist exist in an uncanny realm between living being and machine: the former spends the entirety of the game encased in a cybernetic suit that obscures and augments her human identity, while the latter is an organic consciousness wired into a vast computer network.</p>
<p>Particularly given the limited graphical capabilities of 1980s game hardware, Metroid’s audio design assumed a crucial role in conveying this unsettling mixture of the electronic and organic to the player. To that end, composer and sound designer Hirokazu “Hip” Tanaka (b. 1957) eschewed the melody-based approach to game composition popularized by composers such as Koji Kondo (<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>). Instead, Tanaka’s sound design exploited the technology of early game audio in highly unconventional ways, often creating timbres reminiscent of midcentury electronic art music.</p>
<p>By deviating significantly from the standards of the era, he hoped to (in his words) make players “feel as if they were encountering a living creature” by creating a soundscape “without any distinctions between music and sound effects.” The result of this approach, however, is a consistent blurring of multiple boundaries—not just between music and sound effect, but also between diegetic- and non-diegetic sound, organic and electronic sources, and, ultimately, between the player and the avatar. Using the “living circuits” of Louis and Bebe Barron’s landmark electronic score for the film Forbidden Planet (1956) as both model and forerunner of Tanaka’s work, this paper explores how <em>Metroid</em>’s “cybernetic” sound design both reflects the game’s narrative and resonates with 1980s preoccupations with the electronic nature of video games.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Encultured Musical Codes in Bear McCreary’s Video Game and TV Soundtracks</p>

<p>Bear McCreary is recognized as one of the most innovative composers writing for television and video games in recent years. A common thread runs through the bulk of his work: a fusion of live-recorded instruments drawn from the Western classical orchestra, various popular styles and electronic technologies, and a range of non-Western traditions. The combinations of instruments in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> (2004–09), <em>The Walking Dead</em> (2010–) <em>Dark Void</em> (2010), <em>SOCOM 4</em> (2011), and <em>Defiance</em> (2013–15) led commentators, and McCreary himself, to brand his music as “exotic” and “eclectic” with little attention paid to the multivalent nature of these terms and the degree to which they account for the style of his soundtracks.</p>
<p>Drawing upon McCreary’s published commentaries, his interviews with the media, remarks from executives and producers, critical reviews of his scores, and my own personal correspondence with the composer, I posit a framework through which this blending of traditions can be understood. Analysis of critical reception through the lens of theories of exoticism and eclecticism as well as Claudia Gorbman’s cultural musical codes provides fresh insights into McCreary’s creative approach. While his scores often evoke the distant or unfamiliar, I argue that he rarely employs instruments to call to mind their native contexts. Instead, McCreary re-contextualizes them as dramatic signifiers that become encultured as the television series or video game progresses. My conclusions offer a model for assessing comparable soundtracks, which collectively reflect an ongoing interest in non-Western sounds and intercultural musical practices by the entertainment industry. For many composers working in small- and large-screen media, a consistent fusion of instruments and stylistic elements has become their primary practice, complicating our conventional perceptions of exoticism and eclecticism.</p>
