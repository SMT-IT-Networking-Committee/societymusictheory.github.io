<p>This talk uses the fieldwork of Zora Neale Hurston as a point of departure
for meditations on how feminist noise can resonate in the academy. Hurston
embraced the noise of early field work recordings. By not splicing out what
others considered “noise,” Hurston actively resisted any attempt to make the
people with whom she made music into static phonographic objects. An alt-ac
pioneer, she got no play in academic music circles despite an Ivy League
degree, a Guggenheim fellowship, and the support of Franz Boaz. Inspired by
Anne Carson, I argue that Hurston embodies the essential noise of women whose
flesh and voice make logos inaccessible. It is long past time for music
scholars to embrace the kind of feminist noise that Zora Neale Hurston
practiced. Such an embrace means telling stories that our field couldn’t hear
in the past. It means thinking deeply not just about ideas but also about
practices and institutions, about the gritty unseemly business of universities.
Finally, it means thinking past diversity to imagine truly equitable
futures.”</p>
