<p class="abs-title">Blackness, Telepresence, and the Carceral State: Listening to the Hologram in American Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lucie Vagnerova (Columbia University)</p>

<p>My paper addresses a recent series of concerts and installations presenting deceased American artists in artificially voiced, 3D-animated, hologram-like form. The late rap artists 2Pac (Tupac Amaru Shakur), Ol’ Dirty Bastard (Russell Tyrone Jones), and Eazy-E (Eric Lynn Wright), as well as pop artists Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, are among the black American musicians rendered as hologram since 2012. To unpack the complex relationship of Blackness and telepresence in the American musical imaginary, I also draw on recent multimedia installations by Pamela Z, Kevin Beasley, and Laurie Anderson and Mohammed el Gharani.</p>
<p>I argue that this emerging music-technological tradition hinges on the fact that black life in the United States is always implicitly haunted by death. Tracing the figuration of the hologram as deathly in American popular culture, I draw on critical histories of sound recording to theorize listening to voices from “beyond the grave” (Sterne, Théberge, Stanyek, and Piekut). In hip-hop hologram performance, death appears in many guises: as overdose, AIDS diagnosis, murder, but also as conviction, imprisonment, second class citizenship, and the very policing of black life.</p>
<p>How, then, do we listen to these performances through the prism of death, both literal and social? Beasley’s <em>I.W.M.S.B.</em>, a 2012 electronic composition that digitally blends the voices of dead rappers into a nebulous flow, provides a point of access for my discussion of artificial vocality in hologram performance. I also draw on recent theories of musical Liveness to address the participatory character of rhyming and singing along with the hologram as well as the political stakes of the not-so-live performance of Blackness (Auslander, Sanden, Porcello). On the surface, I conclude, the hip-hop hologram appeals to the Afrofuturist tradition, but the corporate interests at play betray, at best, a partial exploitation of black performance with a strong footing in American music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Symphonic Funk and the Discourse of “Hot Rhythm” in the Music of Prince</p>

<p>The popular musician Prince rose to fame in the early 1980s as a sexual and racial provocateur whose work played upon Anglo-American fears of miscegenation and same-sex desire. However, he soon shifted his image towards a more traditionally masculine look, a change that was accompanied by an increasing reliance on older soul and funk musical idioms and a decreasing emphasis on rock guitar. This new direction struck many reviewers as kitschy or pretentious, but Prince’s simultaneous movement away from sexual licentiousness and towards musical styles more strongly marked as African-American represents an attempt to disentangle black musical identity from what musicologist Ron Radano calls the discourse of “hot rhythm.” Rhythm is the musical parameter most closely associated with sexuality, and as Radano and Kofi Agawu have pointed out, the syncopation of jazz and other African-American genres is linked to long-standing stereotypes of black identity in the white Western imagination. As an African-American musician who built his career on explicit sexuality and funk rhythm, Prince found himself mired in this discourse, identified primarily by his “driving sense of syncopation and passion for sexual lyrics,” in the words of one reviewer, and escaping it required careful musical maneuvering.</p>
<p>In this study, I explore how Prince constructs funk grooves that undermine stereotypes of black male sexual voracity and violence while retaining the African-American aesthetic values that, as Alexander Stewart and Olly Wilson have demonstrated, connect funk to West African rhythmic practices. Prince explores this tension between funk’s proud Afrocentrism and the web of racial exoticism that white America has spun around “African rhythm” on mid-1980s albums like <em>Parade</em>. In my analyses of songs from this album I demonstrate how Prince creates polyrhythmic funk rhythms within an ascetically spare instrumental texture, and how he puts this stripped-down funk style into dialogue with an avant-garde orchestral sensibility, a move that resembles Duke Ellington’s late-career “symphonic jazz” turn. In so doing, Prince creates funk music that enacts a complex and cosmopolitan black identity and resists the idea of a racial-rhythmic essence.</p>
