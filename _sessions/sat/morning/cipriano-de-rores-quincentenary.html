<p class="abs-title">Cipriano de Rore Reappraised: Lovesickness and Eroticism in <em>Calami sonum ferentes</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Jason Rosenholtz-Witt (Northwestern University)</p>

<p>“Every musician knows that four basses is not musically appealing.” So writes Edward Lowinsky about Cipriano de Rore’s enigmatic composition, <em>Calami sonum ferentes</em>. Although Orlando di Lasso admired <em>Calami</em> enough to include it as the last piece in his first collection (Antwerp: Tielman Susato, 1555), the piece fared badly in eighteenth through twentieth-century criticism largely because of anachronistic analytic methods. Critics from Charles Burney to Alfred Einstein and beyond have called it bizarre, unseemly, and unattractive. Not only did they find fault with its unusual combination of four bass voices, the particular use of chromaticism was perceived as “rebelling against law and nature” (August Ambros, 1868). Lowinsky believed that de Rore intended his piece to be unappealing, most likely a satiric composition meant as an “anti-chromatic manifesto.” His reasoning is that the music is deliberately harsh and contradicts the text. How might a reading differ if we take this supposition as fallacious?</p>
<p>G. B. Pigna’s poem invokes Catullus, the first-century Roman poet. A close study of Catullus’ readership in the sixteenth century illuminates allegoric messages in the verse, both erotic and melancholic, and facilitates a more accurate hermeneutic reading of de Rore’s composition. Additionally, knowledge of early modern medicine helps contextualize the physical and corporeal nature of the narrator’s malady––he is a deeply ill individual who has degenerated from lovesickness into the more dangerous and less treatable melancholia. A musical-textual analysis in this light shows de Rore thoughtfully matching the music to the text.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Comparing Cipriano de Rore’s Four- and Five-Voice Madrigals: Indicators of Style in Cadential Practice</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benjamin Dobbs (Greenwood, S.C.)</p>

<p>Cipriano de Rore’s madrigals, exemplars of the genre during the mid-sixteenth century, are all the more significant for the composer’s inclination toward a five-voice texture at a time when four-voice madrigals were standard. Indeed, in de Rore’s output the number of madrigals for five voices more than doubles the number of madrigals for four voices. This paper compares the composer’s style in four-voice and five-voice works, considering the rhetorical-formal device of the cadence from contrapuntal, harmonic, and textual perspectives. Analysis of the roles and patterns of individual voices, the combination of those voices, and variations in those patterns according to mode and ensemble size enables the designation of the elements of a cadence as essential to a texture of any number of parts, inherent to a particular mode, or as characteristic of de Rore’s four-voice or five-voice style more broadly construed. Two collections published in 1557, de Rore’s fourth book of madrigals for five voices and his second book of madrigals for four voices, serve as the primary body for consideration. The composer’s madrigals for three, six, and eight voices, though few in number, provide further repertoire for comparison, and will be considered briefly.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Is there Evidence for Meter via Cumulative Rhythm and Attack-Point Density in Cipriano de Rore’s Madrigals?</p>
<p class="abs-author">Richard Hermann (University of New Mexico)</p>

<p><em>Grove Music Online</em> describes de Rore’s music as “undergoing profound changes of style from his early to his late works.” This already suggests that my title cannot be definitively answered without an extraordinary completeness of repertoire analysis: may we hope for clever computer-assisted data collection in this regard? Thus, I here restrict consideration to examples from his early madrigals.</p>
<p>Sandwiched between books by AMB Berger (1993) and Houle (1987) are recent essays by Mavromatis (2012) and Royal (2012), which respectively take probabilistic and history of theory approaches to temporal issues of de Rore’s time. Instead, I will investigate an old technique called cumulative rhythm. This represents attack-points occurring in any voice and records them on a single line with a duration that stretches to the next present attack-point. Attack-point density notes how many voices attack at each recorded entry in the cumulative rhythm.</p>
<p>Curiously, these techniques have been missing from prominent recent textbooks and studies. Analysis of a small group of religious works from the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries reveals temporal organization. Nonetheless, Schubert (1995) points out modular constructions in the duos of Lassus that as a by-product generate cumulative and attack-point repetitions and, thus, organization. Are these structures present and causative for an emerging meter in de Rore’s madrigals?</p>

<p class="abs-title">Scheme and Schism in Rore’s <em>Mia benigna fortuna</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Timothy R. McKinney (Baylor University)</p>

<p>Discrepancy between recorded performances by respected early music ensembles of Cipriano de Rore’s madrigal <em>Mia benigna fortuna</em> underscores the importance of historically informed analysis for interpretation of music from former times. The current presentation reviews theoretical and compositional conventions regulating cadences and the associated application of <em>musica ficta</em> in light of an expressive moment in <em>Mia benigna fortuna</em> that is far more subtle than the extraordinary harmonic and melodic effects for which this madrigal is known. At issue will be the precise location and nature of the cadence accompanying the setting of “in doglia e’n pianto.” Should there be a half cadence concluding on an A sonority, as has been suggested, or a subsequent interrupted cadence toward D? In either event, should <em>musica ficta</em> in the form of C-sharp be applied to the A sonority, rendering it major, as in the performance by the Hilliard Ensemble, or should the sonority be minor, as in the performance by the Huelgas Ensemble? The talk concludes that expressive factors outweigh cadential conventions in this case. Rore intentionally undermines the cadence to reflect a marked shift in the emotional tone of the poem by emphasizing minor harmonic quality (a technique learned from Willaert), much as he famously broke conventions of proper melodic writing in this madrigal for the same reason by introducing leaps by major sixth.</p>

<p class="abs-title">A Deliberate Hoax? Using Rore’s <em>Calami sonum ferentes</em> as a Pedagogical Tool</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jared C. Hartt (Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory)</p>

<p>After grasping the concepts of two-voice species counterpoint, students understandably struggle with composing three- and four-voice textures. To aid in this regard, detailed study of representative examples is naturally of paramount importance. Given <em>Calami sonum ferentes</em>’s bad press in modern-day scholarship— for instance, Edward Lowinsky (1989) calls it a “deliberate hoax”—the madrigal may not be the first choice of species counterpoint instructors to illustrate salient features of mid-sixteenth-century multi-part composition. This lightning talk, however, will demonstrate why it proves to be a pedagogically useful example in the classroom. Not only does the madrigal’s pervasive chromaticism, rhythmic and metric anomalies, and suggestive poetry pique the students’ interest, but a detailed look at Rore’s compositional praxis and dissonance treatment therein reveals many useful tools for the budding student of counterpoint. Specifically, excerpts from <em>Calami sonum ferentes</em> will demonstrate how it can be used as a model to illustrate imitative writing, combining species, text setting, pitch doubling, treatment of suspensions in three- and four-voice textures in several voice combinations and registers, composing evaded cadences, fauxbourdon, changing textures, as well as other salient issues. Several seemingly peculiar progressions likewise lead the way to fruitful discussion of Rore’s meticulous handling of so-called prolonged counterpoint.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Building a Narrative: Music and Text Relationships in the Undergraduate Analysis Classroom</p>

<p>The role of analysis in undergraduate music education is to reinforce good interpretation skills and communicate musical intent. Good analytical interpretation of contrapuntal music, such as a madrigal, relies on identification and expression of formal elements such as points of imitation, awareness of one’s role in structural cadences, use of appropriate dynamic contrast in peaks and valleys within phrases, and emphasis of dissonances and their resolutions. In addition to these technical features that can be analyzed and used to clarify compositional voice and performance interpretations, I argue that the most important element of madrigal analysis is the relationship of text and music, and indeed this relationship should be the starting point. Examining the music-text relationship constructs a global view of musical moments that grounds any subsequent analysis of cadences, points of imitation, form, indications of emergent tonality, and motivic gestures. The connection of text and music also paves a road to narrative theories of music that are accessible to the undergraduate learner. To illustrate these points, I will demonstrate the validity of including early music within the undergraduate analysis curriculum by using two contrasting madrigals by Cipriano de Rore, <em>Mia benigna fortuna</em> and <em>Da le belle contrade d’oriente,</em> as models for analysis of text/ music relationships, from which we many launch into a deeper understanding of their more technical, formal elements.</p>
