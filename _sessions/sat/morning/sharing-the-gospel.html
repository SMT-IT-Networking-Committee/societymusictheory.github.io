<p class="abs-title">Embodying Faith and Fandom: Songs of Identity in Depression-Era Gospel Singing Communities</p>
<p class="abs-author">C. Megan MacDonald (Florida State University)</p>

<p>During the Great Depression, a time marked by migration and unemployment, the southern gospel industry flourished. Publishers produced records, hosted singing schools, sent quartets to perform at conventions, and sold millions of songbooks each year. Beyond a commercial popular music, the songbooks bound together faith-based singing communities where participants could reconcile shifting identities of gender, race, and regionalism in song. Publishers produced consumable products—songbooks and recordings—but the industry thrived due to creations of fan culture, such as submissions of songs and poetry to songbooks and fan newsletters.</p>
<p>This paper argues that these products of fan culture reveal performances of shifting intersectional identities that transformed into shared experiences through the individual and the communal embodiment of song. When the books were released every six months, singers quickly learned the four-part harmonies and the lyrics echoed from homes and churches to conventions and concerts. Often songs like “I’ll Fly Away” emerged from the intended ephemerality of the books to preserve lasting impressions of the South and the Great Depression. Songwriters addressed complex theological and cultural constructions of identity—affected by migration, labor, motherhood, and whiteness—in musical arrangements. These arrangements were then breathed into sound by the community as a whole. While the publishers produced the books, they were merely conduits and gatekeepers for these embodied expressions of faith. This research expands on the recent studies of southern gospel publishers by Goff, Shearon, and Harrison to include voices of the community through critical examination of song lyrics, songbook covers, interviews, and gospel newsletters housed in archives at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Emory University, the Center for Popular Music at Middle Tennessee State University, and the Library of Congress. These materials provide a vantage point to better understand how the embodiment of individual and communal song creates meaning and articulates identity in faith-based communities.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Tuning Up” in Contemporary Gospel Performance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Braxton Shelley (University of Chicago)</p>

<p>For practitioners of many African American Christian traditions, “tuning up” is a colloquial referent for a preacher’s shift from speech into song, most often at the end of a sermon. This phenomenon and its antecedents lie at the heart of many scholarly examinations of black preaching, ranging from Rosenburg’s (1970) <em>Can These Bones Live?: The Art of the American Folk Preacher</em> to Thomas’s (1997) <em>They Like to Never Quit Praisin’ God: The Role of Celebration in Preaching</em>. These observations concerning the musicality of black preaching depend on an analogy between such sermons and gospel songs. Although scholars have noted the interrelation of African American preaching and African American gospel music (Floyd 1997; Ramsey 2003), their relationship has not yet been used as a means to theorize gospel performance.</p>
<p>In this paper, I extend “tuning up” from its specific role in black preaching to contemporary gospel performance, considering this practice as an analytic for formal procedure in gospel music. I begin by analyzing excerpts from sermons— Bishop James Morton’s “The Lazarus Conspiracy,” Rev. Dr. Gina Stewart’s “Am I My Brother and My Sister’s Keeper?” and Rev. Dr. E. Dewey Smith’s “A Seminary From A Cemetery”—to illustrate the different forms this practice can take. I will then use homiletics, ritual theory, practice theory, and phenomenology to argue that “tuning up” is a means of organizing attention. Close readings of three gospel songs—Richard Smallwood’s (1998) “Healing,” Myrna Summer’s (1975) “Oh How Precious,” and Brenda Moore’s (1989) “Perfect Praise”—will illustrate how the vamp, the repetitive ending cycle that is one of gospel’s central features, musically performs the process of “tuning up.” As in the sermons, and in similar settings, the structure and performance of each of these songs invites an attention shift concomitant with the beginning of its vamp. It constitutes a shift in performance that calls forth a change in perception—from the individual to the collective, and from the ear to the body, engendering a communal experience that lies at the heart of the gospel aesthetic.</p>
