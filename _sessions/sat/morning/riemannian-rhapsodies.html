<p class="title">Insulated Formalism in Transformational and Neo-Riemannian Theory</p>
<p class="author">Benjamin Hansberry (Columbia University)</p>

<p>The distinction between phenomenological and abstract, theoretical considerations underlies many methodological tensions in music theory with music analysis often presenting some <i>combination</i> of experiential and theoretical ideas. Transformational analyses, for example, use the “transformational attitude” to connect formal claims to active, musical <i>experiences</i> (Lewin 1977). Transformational theory was influential in the development of neo-Riemannian theory, with maps of harmonic spaces sometimes conceptualized as kinds of transformational networks. But despite these apparently experiential origins, critics of neo-Riemannian theory have highlighted a lack of phenomenological engagement in its practice (Rings 2011, Harrison 2011).</p>
<p>While formal technologies are integral to transformational and neo-Riemannian analysis, we can understand the import of musical experience by considering the functions of abstract theory and phenomenology to be conceptually segregated. Under this paradigm, the main action of each type of concept is “segregated” into different analytical roles, insulating formal technologies from their phenomenology and allowing analysts to define new formal terms without immediately worrying over how they bear out in experience.</p>
<p>David Lewin’s analysis of Stockhausen’s <i>Klavierstück III</i> (Lewin 1993) provides an exemplary instance of this conceptual admixture. I give a brief commentary on this analysis, arguing that it consists of three basic steps: (1) phenomenological reflection, (2) formalization and exploration of theoretical relationships, and (3) translation of formal results <i>back</i> into phenomenological terms. I argue further that a similar analytical narrative underlies many neo-Riemannian analyses. While the first and third steps may appear absent or hazy, the goal—developing a new hearing from abstract formalizations—remains the same.</p>

<p class="title">L’Apothéose de Rameau: A Survey of Henri Pousseur’s Network
  Technique (<i>technique des réseaux</i>)</p>
<p class="author">André Brégégère (Queensborough Community College, CUNY)</p>

<p>The remarkable flourishing of Network Theory within the North-American music-theoretical discourse of the last two decades has largely bypassed the important precedent of Belgian composer Henri Pousseur’s (1929–2009) Network Technique (“technique des réseaux,”), a diverse series of heuristic procedures based on the use of interval cycles and networks, set forth in the 1960s and continuously expanded upon during the remainder of Pousseur’s career. My paper will offer a survey of the development and application of Network Technique, beginning with a brief review of its theoretical introduction in Pousseur’s 1968 article, “L’Apothéose de Rameau,” followed by a series of analytical vignettes illustrating its application in early works from the 1960s and 70s, and by a more detailed analysis of a more recent work, <i>Les Litanies d’Icare</i>, for piano solo (1994).</p>

<p class="title">Kurth’s Dynamic Dualism, or Three Responses to Riemann</p>
<p class="author">Daphne Tan (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Dualism, a cornerstone of Hugo Riemann’s system and its most polemical aspect, was a dominant theoretical concern well into the twentieth century. Ernst Kurth, one of the most prominent contemporaries of Riemann, is seldom associated with this concept. Yet as I demonstrate in this paper, Kurth took pains to address dualism and Riemann in print. Just as Riemann’s explanation for dualism underwent several revisions, Kurth’s rejoinders evolved over the course of his career.</p>
<p>The first half of this paper examines Kurth’s responses to Riemann in <i>Die Voraussetzungen der theoretischen Harmonik</i> (1913) and <i>Romantische Harmonik</i> (1920). For Kurth, Riemann’s initial campaign for the existence of undertones and his subsequent invocation of frequency and wavelength relied too heavily on tone-psychological assumptions. <i>Musikalische Logik</i>, Kurth argued, must be based on psychological<i> </i>premises; after all, “dualism in harmony is not sonic in nature . . . but energetic.”</p>
<p><i>Musikpsychologie</i> (1931) is my focus in the second half. In his final publication, Kurth targets Riemann’s theory of <i>Tonvorstellung</i>. Unsatisfied with Riemann’s reliance on conscious processes, Kurth counters with his own theory of tonality grounded in (unconscious) oppositional forces. I examine this “dynamic dualism” and its “three levels of development.” Finally, with Kurth’s own discussion of Hugo Wolf’s “An den Schlaf” as a starting point (1920), I suggest how dynamic dualism has the potential to bear analytical fruit.</p>

<p class="title">FRETworks: Idiomatic Voice Leading on the Guitar</p>
<p class="author">Daniel Tompkins (Florida State University</p>

<p>This paper explores the harmonic space of the guitar and transformational possibilities therein. The guitar’s harmonic space will be conceptualized as a Cartesian plane of frets by strings where voice leading is measured as node and shape movement along the plane. Fretboard-transformational distance will be compared to more conventional pitch-transformational distance, which also compares the perceived harmonic distance between listener and performer.</p>
<p>Historical tablatures, particularly Alfabeto tablature from the early 17th-century Baroque guitar’s repertoire, show the prevalence of shape-based voice leading and will serve as historical models for chordal transformations. The result will be graphs similar to Klumpenhouwer networks but with each node assigned to a specific string. Isography will therefore be synonymous with isomorphic shapes on the fretboard.</p>
<p>A partial-planing technique that is abundant in the 20th-century classical guitar repertoire will be used for “fretwork” analyses. Some idiomatic passages in Elliott Carter’s <i>Changes for Solo Guitar</i> (1984) will be modeled with “fretworks.”</p>
