<p class="abs-title">Outsiders and Insiders: Musical Practices of African and Brazil-Born Slaves as recorded in Brazilian Newspapers</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rogerio Budasz (University of California, Riverside)</p>

<p>Newspapers are among the most important and least researched sources for information on Brazilian music during the nineteenth century. Regarding the music of African- and Brazilian-born slaves, newspaper ads, chronicles, and police reports provide the distorted view from those who disdained and tried to eliminate those practices. Playing the marimba, guitar, and cavaquinho appear in the ads as identifying features of runaway slaves, along with observations on their perceived moral and physical defects. A different discourse surfaces when a slave owner announced a slave for sale. In these cases, playing European wind instruments, reading music, and knowing some music theory were positive features that could increase a slave’s monetary value. Both types of ads reveal strong connections between music making and professional occupations. Barbers were by far the most common professionals to play a European music instrument among slaves, and most of these barbers were West Africans. Bi-musicality surfaces among West, Central, and East Africans, revealing a high degree of flexibility and adaptation. Brazilian-born slaves outnumbered Africans as guitar (viola and violão) players and had little interest for African instruments, with the exception of those used in religious practices. Data collected so far also suggests a link between specific African ethnicities in the diverse types of street and religious music making in Brazilian cities. It also provides a clear picture of the actual configuration, training, and functions of the so-called <em>música de barbeiros</em>, ensembles of barber musicians that were common in Rio and Salvador by the 1820s and ’30s, and that are generally regarded as the predecessors of <em>choro</em> groups. Moreover, it shows that music worked as a path for newly arrived Africans to become insiders, in some cases even helping them to attain manumission.</p>


<p class="abs-title">“Mata cacique” (Kill the Indian Chief): The Crossroad Between Musical Activism and Indigenous Imagination in Brazilian Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Silvio dos Santos (University of Florida)</p>

<p>Responding to the news of a murdered Indian chief in northern Brazil around 1980, Marlos Nobre composed his <em>Yanománi</em>, op. 47 as a symbol to the suffering of an indigenous nation facing annihilation. This palindromic work conveys an imagined Indian ritual of death and transfiguration, where the cacique is murdered, but returns near the end with a call for revenge. This is significant within the contemporaneous notions of the Yanomami as savage people, as proclaimed by Napoleon Chagnon’s seminal <em>Yanomamö, the fierce people</em> (1968). As anthropologists have observed, Chagnon’s work justified the passage of laws and policies by the Brazilian government that proved to be disastrous to the indigenous nations. As one of the foremost Brazilian composers, Nobre pioneered an advocacy on behalf of the Yanomami through art, at a time when only international attention could potentially change their situation. In attempting to restore the cacique’s dignity, Nobre anticipated the work of Sting and other Brazilian singers in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Yet, as a cultural artifact, Nobre’s work plays into the long history of constructed images of the <em>Indio brasileiro</em> (Brazilian Indian), which has varied from representations of the exotic and noble savage to the backward and pagan Indian. Nobre further complicates this characterization through a confluence of a pagan figure who, in calling for revenge, assumes a position of power that threatens national stability.</p>
<p>As I demonstrate, Nobre highlights the plight of the Yanomami within a musical language that, while emulating musical aspects of the indigenous Brazilians, is built on serial procedures and extended techniques. As such, while it has the power to reach broader audiences worldwide, it also emphasizes the sense of otherness of the Brazilian Indians. Indeed, while the few indigenous words in the lyrics are hardly understood, the Portuguese words are clear: <em>Mata cacique</em> (kill the Indian chief). Ultimately, Nobre’s work represents an emerging consciousness of the need to preserve the life and culture of Yanomami, joining the work of anthropologists and artists in bringing international attention to the negligence, if not criminal acts, of the Brazilian government.</p>
