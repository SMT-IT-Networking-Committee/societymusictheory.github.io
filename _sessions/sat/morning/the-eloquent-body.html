<p class="abs-title">The Clavecinist’s Eloquent Body: Gestural Rhetoric in French Baroque Harpsichord Playing</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christina Hutten (University of British Columbia)</p>

<p>Courtly life in early modern France was a spectacle of legible human bodies. “[At a ball] all your steps and all your actions are tributaries to the eyes of the spectators, exposing to them the good and bad with which Art and Nature have favored or disgraced your person,” wrote Michel de Pure in <em>L’Idée des spectacles</em> (1668). Harpsichordists participated in high society’s obsession with display and interrogation of character, giving their compositions picturesque titles evoking high dances or socialites like <em>La Conti</em>. Susan McClary (2012) and Sara Gross Ceballos (2014) have interpreted French keyboard music as the aural counterpart of literary and painted portraiture but have not considered how the visible dimension of performance contributed to successful characterization. I will argue that sonic imitations depended on harpsichord-playing’s role in the cultivation and demonstration of civility through physical discipline.</p>
<p>Affective performance required a credible performer. Close reading of references to <em>posture</em> in eulogies, treatises, and letters of harpsichord pedagogues, including Jean-Henri D’Anglebert, François Couperin, Jean Philippe Rameau, Pierre Claude Foucquet, and others, reveals that French audiences read body language not as the sort of unfolding rhetorical argument described by Tom Beghin in his analysis of Haydn sonatas (2015), but as Aristotelian modes of persuasion: <em>logos</em>, evidence of the player’s <em>adresse</em> (competence), <em>ethos</em>, demonstration of <em>talent</em>—the physical training needed to execute florid ornamentation with an air of ease, and <em>pathos</em>, expression of <em>sentiment</em> (feeling).</p>
<p>Composers exploited the intersection between good deportment and visible features of harpsichord techniques to create subtle pictorial effects. Using video of my performance of a representative allemande by D’Anglebert, I will demonstrate how <em>stile brisé</em> and <em>agréments</em> mimic the physical demands and visual impact of ballroom dance. With Rameau’s <em>Les Cyclopes</em>, I will explore the moral tensions surrounding the use of <em>batteries</em> and hand crossing, regarded as immodest contortions, to evoke grotesque characters. My paper will prove that a historicized understanding of the claveciniste’s eloquent body is integral to the interpretation and performance of this repertoire and key to understanding its social potency.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut”: Early Modern Physiologies and Metaphors of the Heart</p>
<p class="abs-author">Bettina Varwig (King’s College London)</p>

<p>This paper investigates physiological and metaphorical conceptions of the heart in early eighteenth-century Lutheran culture, using J. S. Bach’s 1714 cantata “Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut” (BWV 199) as a focal point. The cantata’s libretto is replete with references to the (fluid or solid) materiality of this vital organ, from the heart overflowing with blood to becoming a fount of tears, drying up, being battered, and breaking. When resisting the common assumption that this kind of language was inevitably conceived as metaphorical, these ideas begin to resonate intriguingly with scientific and medical writings of the time, lending a palpable physical reality to their poetic and theological semantics. Over the preceding century, anatomical knowledge of the heart had been thoroughly transformed in European discourse, as the Aristotelian notion of the heart as the seat of sensation and the passions was challenged by a mechanistic understanding of the organ as primarily a blood pump, bolstered by William Harvey’s discovery of blood circulation in 1628. These competing lineages of knowledge continued to interact in intricate and often contradictory ways in the decades around 1700, as in Steven Blankaart’s <em>Reformirte Anatomie</em> (1691), which affirmed that the interface between body and soul did not happen exclusively in the brain, as posited by Cartesian philosophy, but that the soul was distributed throughout the body via the blood flow. Such tangled notions of human corporeality throw a very different light not only on this sort of cantata text and its musical realization, but more broadly on the question of where and how music was thought to operate in and upon performers’ and listeners’ bodies. Building on current research in sensory history, music and materiality, and the history of the emotions, the kind of somatic archaeology proposed here aims to move beyond the shorthand appeal to “Pietist” modes of expression in Bach’s works by recovering some of the intensely sensual dimensions of the Lutheran worship experience. It thereby seeks to instigate a more comprehensive reconstruction of the historical phenomenologies of music and the body that underpinned these early modern forms of musicking.</p>
