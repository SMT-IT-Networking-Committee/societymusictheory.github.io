<p class="abs-title">Structural Levels in South Indian Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Schachter (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>In the present study, I propose a theory of structural levels in Karnatak music, the classical music of South India. In the characteristic patterns of melodic ornamentation and phrase construction within a <i>raga</i>, as well as in formal approaches to composition and improvisation, the pitch language of Karnatak music involves highly sophisticated elaborations of simple voice-leading strands that themselves elaborate a normative background structure. While the approach in this paper bears obvious resemblance to important currents in Western music theory, the concept of structural levels also has substantial precedent in Indian musical scholarship (Mudaliyar 1893, Sambamoorthy 1964, Rammohan 2006, Ramakrishna 2012, Janakiraman 2013, Krishna 2013), and it features prominently in the deliberate compositional and improvisational strategies of musicians past and present. The musical analyses suggest surprising isomorphisms both within and across the various structural levels, raising important questions regarding the interrelationship between theory and practice. A secondary but no less crucial aim of this study is to continue to build awareness and increase accessibility between Western and Indian musical traditions, hopefully piquing excitement for the potential fruits of future interaction.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Subdominants, Lower-Fifth Dividers, and Inversion in
  Schenkerian Theory </p>
<p class="abs-author">Frank Samarotto (Indiana University, Bloomington)</p>

<p>In Schenker’s mature theory the subdominant would seem to have a decidedly subordinate status. This paper proposes to show that the subdominant, and the lower fifth in general, took on several distinct roles during the development of Schenker’s theory, and that these merit reconsideration. The resulting categories, though not mutually exclusive, are conceptually discrete and differ in logical justification; together they allow for a richer analytical palette.</p>
<p>First, two familiar categories will be reexamined: these include the use of the subdominant as support for a neighbor note, as well as the ubiquitous use of subdominant to prepare the dominant. A third category approaches <i>Funktionstheorie</i> by suggesting that the subdominant <i>Stufe</i> can be represented on the surface by II, an equivalence sometimes implied in Schenker’s own analyses.</p>
<p>My final two categories propose—or revive—unconventional categories of the subdominant. Schenker initially paired upper-fifth dividers with their counterpart of lower-fifth dividers, but quietly retired the latter in his mature work. I will argue that the lower-fifth divider can be reinstated by employing a rationale derived from strict composition. A final category draws on the <i>Harmonielehre</i>’s<i> </i>concepts of development and inversion that characterize, respectively, the “naturally”-occuring upward fifth motion and its “artificial” derivation, the descending fifth. The analytical value of this proposed category of inversion will be explored in examples ranging from Monteverdi to Beethoven.</p>
<p>This paper will show that a more nuanced and multifarious view of the subdominant can find real foundation in Schenker’s work.</p>
