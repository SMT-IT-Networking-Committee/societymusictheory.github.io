<p>While the aesthetic of film music during the Classical Hollywood era
(1930–60) was largely one of late romanticism, with a chromatic tonal palette,
lush orchestrations, and traditional thematic structures, recent research has
begun to explore how Bernard Herrmann (1911–75) broke this mold in a number of
ways. Schneller (2012) discusses the manipulation of motivic cells as the
basis of his thematic material. Waxman (2010) observes stylistic links between
Herrmann and Charles Ives. And Husarik (2010) examines experimental mixing of
acoustic and electronic instruments in Herrmann’s score to <i>The Day the
Earth Stood Still</i> (1951). These traits all betray a larger tendency in
Herrmann’s film music toward modernist techniques, which only became widely
adopted in film’s post-Classical era, thus establishing Herrmann as a
trailblazer for later film composers. This alternative-format special session
will present five ten-minute lightning talks with eight-minute Q&amp;As. Each talk
will scrutinize one strain of modernist writing in Hitchcock’s <i>Vertigo</i>
(1958), a score that remains one of Herrmann’s most esteemed even as the film
reaches its sixtieth anniversary in 2018.</p>
