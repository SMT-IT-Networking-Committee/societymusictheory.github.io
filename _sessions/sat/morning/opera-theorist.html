<p>The tale of opera and the modern music theorist is not one of love at first sight: if anything, it is a flirtation nearly unrequited. While the repertoire invited for discussion at SMT meetings has widened recently to embrace popular, film, experimental and non-Western musics, opera has remained a wallflower. This vast literature—a dominant art-form for much of the common-practice period—still awaits mainstream analytic attention. Neglecting it distorts our cultural understanding and leads to unwitting censorship. More importantly, there are issues that take center stage in opera analysis that have significant ramifications for other repertoire: narrativity, tonality, interactions of schemata and music topics, and form. While some theorists have gallantly made overtures to opera, most of the work has been on Germanic composers, snubbing a wide body of work by French, Italian, and Russian composers, among others. This is part of a larger trend: at the 2014 SMT conference, for example, only two papers were on eighteenth- or nineteenth-century music by non-German composers (not including poster or joint sessions).</p>
<p>To begin to address this problem, two theorists explore a few of these issues (specifically, in regard to tonal closure and form), connecting diverse operatic selections to music theory and analysis.</p>

  Operas</p>

<p>In a number opera, what does it mean when a number, an act, or an opera begins and ends in the same key? What does it mean when it doesn’t? Studies of tonality in opera extend back nearly a century, but there is less consensus on this subject than ever. Music theorists (as opposed to historical musicologists) have barely addressed the issue outside of Mozart and Wagner. Non-German composers have been especially neglected.</p>
<p>In this paper I discuss three enormous numbers from Rossini’s serious operas: Act 3 of <i>Otello</i> (1816), which constitutes a single number; the Act 1 trio from <i>Maometto II</i> (1820); and the Act 1 finale of <i>Semiramide</i> (1823). All begin and end in the same key. Arguments for “tonal unity” are difficult to maintain for any but the <i>Semiramide</i> excerpt, the most conventional of the three. Even its coherence is of an unusual kind, involving hexatonic poles, parenthetical mediants, and the recurrent highlighting of a single diminished-seventh chord. The <i>Otello</i> and <i>Maometto</i> numbers return to their opening keys as a sign of formal completion but not, I will argue, of tonal closure. That tonal return became a mere terminating convention (to borrow a term from Pieter van den Toorn) made it easier for the next generation of Italian composers to abandon it.</p>

<p>Operatic Formenlehre is alive and well—witness the wealth of publications on the <i>solita forma</i> and on concerto-like sonata forms in Mozart arias. But form in opera has often been thwarted—throughout its long history—by dramatic exigencies: one need only witness recitatives popping up unexpectedly in the middle of Handel’s da capo aria “V’adoro pupille” from <i>Giulio Cesare</i>, or in the sonata form “Cosa sento” in Mozart’s <i>Figaro</i>.</p>
<p>The hybrid relationship that operatic music maintains with drama and text often requires the disruption of musical form, just as it sometimes shatters conventions of harmonic syntax, regular meter—and an almost infinite number of musical “norms.” Is it fruitless, then, to search for consistent formal procedures in a genre that breaks its own rules by design? But there is a vast conceptual distance between form and formlessness. Indeed, in order to create surprise, initial expectations must be created: there must be some formal elements remaining intact so that the audience can perceive the deformation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore those pseudo-forms conceptually mid-route between closed operatic numbers and fragmentary continuum. Terminology is proposed that spans this spectrum. Formal categories are examined here in light of the <i>topos</i> of storm scenes, in operatic selections from all periods. Storm scenes herald moments when ordinary patterns of behavior are thrown to the winds. In addition to the harmonic, rhythmic, and textural disruptions that one expects in an operatic tempest, formal elements run the gamut from clear set pieces to near-disorder.</p>
