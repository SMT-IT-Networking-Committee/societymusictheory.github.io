<p class="abs-title">Trilateral Exchanges: Ragtime in Bombay in the 1910s and Its Musical Connections with London</p>
<p class="abs-author">Bradley Shope (Texas A &amp; M Corpus Christi)</p>

<p>In the 1900s and ’10s in India, foreign and domestic entertainment troupes in urban centers began to cater to a demand for American popular music, including ragtime. Though British regimental bands played ragtime marches from the 1890s throughout South Asia, including numbers written by John Philip Sousa, staged variety shows began to perform ragtime in 1913, when the revue “Hullo Ragtime!” ran sold-out performances at the Royal Opera House in Bombay. This paper will explore a relationship between the established entertainment industry of Bombay and the popularity of ragtime. Here it will focus on professional relationships between touring ragtime shows and the Parsi-, English-, and Hindi-language theater industries, and will suggest that American showman Maurice Bandman, living and performing in India at the time, played a crucial role in organizing shows that included ragtime in Bombay. It will articulate key figures involved in ragtime’s development, describe the character and scope of venues that supported performances, describe the constitution of audiences, and explore the background of performers. Following Andrew Jones’s (2001) pioneering work on American popular music in China, it will tightly contextualize the development of ragtime within colonial entertainment culture as a whole. To this end, it will explore the relationship between ragtime performances in London and their parallel development in Bombay, suggesting that an exchange of resources and personnel between London and Bombay supported much of its presence across urban India.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Sound, Colony, and the Multinational: The Gramophone Company between London and Singapore, 1900–10</p>

<p>Some early sound recordings were made in soundproof studios; many others were produced under more improvised circumstances, often in plush hotels. In 1902, Gramophone Company operative Frederick Gaisberg famously recorded Enrico Caruso in a Milanese hotel; months later, he etched the first <em>bangsawan</em> (Malay opera) discs in a hotel in Singapore. Gaisberg’s travels and diverse palette are familiar to musicologists and ethnomusicologists alike. Less well understood are the ways international transport and mobility furnished the material core of recorded music during those pioneering years. Like Dunlop and Cadbury, the Company was an early multinational corporation, initially sponsored by American investors; like rubber and chocolate, recorded music was the product of venture capitalism on a global scale.</p>
<p>This paper illuminates the vast ensemble of actors and networks that went into the rapidly globalizing music record industry. It does so by retracing the movement of recordists (Gaisberg and George Dillnutt), recording technology (shipped by the ton on ocean liners), shellac (obtained from Indian lac bugs), discs (impressed at the Company’s factories in Riga and elsewhere), and huge, often migrant, labor forces. I track these elements as they came to mediate musical relations between two cities in particular: London and Singapore. These cities had long been connected: Singapore became a British colonial dependency in 1819, and was the Empire’s most thriving entrêpot by 1900. Thus, when the Company—floated on London’s Stock Exchange in 1897—sought to expand, Singapore presented an obvious destination: their 1905 newspaper campaign advertised the gramophone as a means to transport music “from London to some far-away corner of the earth where music never was before, to keep the men who watch the outposts of the Empire entertained.”</p>
<p>Such missionary zeal notwithstanding, I demonstrate that the gramophone facilitated a bidirectional, if unequal, interurban exchange bearing the stamp of colonial politics and economic globalization. I thus sketch an alternative history of early recorded sound: one that departs from those lately proposed by sound scholars (Sterne 2003; 2012; and Horning 2013), to consider the gramophone not only as a cultural and technological form, but also as a globalizing practice of space.</p>
