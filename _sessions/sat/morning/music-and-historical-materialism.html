<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>What is it to account for music, its history, and its theory within a historical-materialist explanatory framework? To answer this question requires that we deliberate about how foundational Marxian concepts apply to music. Most basically, we must ask: from which side of Marx’s division between production and ideology shall we regard music? Should we prioritize the role music plays in material life, i.e. its capacity for satisfying some constellation of human preferences, desires, and needs, and thus its capacity, under capitalism, for assuming the form of a commodity? Or should we instead investigate music as what Marx called a “definite form of social consciousness,” an ideological mode of awareness through which cognizing subjects become aware—though in a potentially distorted, class-perpetuating fashion—of the concrete circumstances of the reproduction of social life? Or should music be seen as somehow transcending or undoing this division? This session’s papers 1) reflect on how these and similar questions have been formulated and answered by previous Marxist thinkers; 2) consider how such questions can or should be formulated and answered by present-day inheritors of Marx’s intellectual legacy; 3) address the reciprocal impact that the subject fields of historical materialism and music theory/musicology have had on one another; 4) identify points of intersection between Marxist theory and particular musical genres/pieces; and 5) indicate how historical-materialist discourse might show the way out of, or at least make palpable the insufficiency of, the self-imposed political narrowness that prevails in contemporary music scholarship.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Marxism and Minimalism: A Troubled Intersection</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sumanth Gopinath (University of Minnesota)</p>

<p>Upon initial reflection, it seems that Marxist thinking has little to do with musical minimalism. The self-avowed apoliticism, spiritualism, and abstraction of much minimalist music appear to be in polar opposition to the musical practices, aesthetics, genres, and forms typically affiliated with Marxist politics—worker’s songs, folk music, socialist realism, and even Marxism-affiliated modernisms. Nonetheless, Marxism and Marxist scholarship can help us to think about the history and interpretation of musical minimalism. In the following paper, I (1) briefly work through the arguments surrounding time, teleology, dialectics, and political valence in (post-) Adornian criticism of musical minimalism; (2) adapt Marxist/ neo-Marxist historical periodization to the interpretation of US-American musical minimalism’s development; (3) consider the class backgrounds of the early US-American musical minimalists/quasi-minimalists (including Young, Riley, Reich, Glass, Cale, Conrad, Monk, Niblock, and Oliveros); and (4) reflect on the basic musical materials of musical minimalism, by considering the possible social determinants of “drone” vs. “pulse-pattern” minimalism and by interrogating minimalism’s implicit notion of a musical “materialism” that is both preoccupied with and divorced from the forms of historical materialism arising in the Marxist tradition. The paper ends by discussing Phill Niblock, who is representative of the most explicitly <em>workerist</em> approach to musical minimalism.</p>

<p>While a Marxist approach to music studies is hardly unprecedented, its most significant expositors tended to assume an audience of initiated Marxists. Figures such as Adorno and János Maróthy took for granted the coherence and intelligibility of their core tenets. As a result, Marxist music theory’s most basic commitments remain under-theorized. With a view to remedying this deficiency, we 1) specify what we take to be the key points of unity for Marxist treatments of music, i.e. the minimal conditions inquiries into music must meet in order to be deemed historical-materialist; and we 2) describe a music-analytical methodological principle or heuristic that meets these conditions.</p>
<p>We begin with the assumption that musical practices are normative. We then defend the Marxian position that the normative structure of action itself—the basis upon which it is decided what is to count as an action and who is to count as performing one—in a given time and place is determined by the development of productive technical capacities, most importantly the division of labor and the form of production.</p>
<p>After laying this groundwork, we argue that certain practices have the societal role of articulating the normative structure of action: from these practices we learn not so much what to do, but what doing is. Our conclusion is that “historical musical materialism,” is properly understood as the attempt to situate music convincingly within a progression of communally self-reflexive practices.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Popular Music Studies, Marxism, and the Cultural Concept</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jarek Ervin (University of Virginia)</p>

<p>The study of popular music is linked to the project of cultural studies. The two are historically coterminous, share core theoretical assumptions, and were advanced by many of the same theorists. This entanglement has only intensified in our current intellectual moment, where it is a truism that we all live within culture. Now, it is all-but impossible to study popular music outside of the cultural studies paradigm.</p>
<p>Cultural studies itself is a diverse field, influenced by a number of traditions. Perhaps the most oft-remarked of these is Marxism. For affiliates of the Birmingham School in particular, the study of culture was a path not to the transformation of mere style, but of social life <em>in toto</em>. Despite this, Marxism has been a persistent thorn in the side of pop scholars. It is now a standard move to define the methodological terrain explicitly through the disavowal of various strains of Marxist thought (Adornian, structuralist, etc.). Indeed, one might argue that pop studies finds its methodology specifically through a doubled gesture of adopting and then abandoning Marxism.</p>
<p>This leaves popular music studies in an anxious place: both within Marxism and without. I argue that this is a tension that can be traced through classic texts from Hall, Hebdige, and other early pioneers. Highlighting the uneasy relationship between classical Marxian theory and those categories culled from cultural studies—and there is none more problematic than the notion of culture itself—I claim that this literature prophesies later renunciations of Marxism.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Are You Deaf?” Historical Materialism and the Art of the (Im)possible</p>
<p class="abs-author">Naomi Waltham-Smith (University of Pennsylvania)</p>

<p>A certain paradigm of potentiality persists throughout the tradition of historical materialism: an idea that historical change consists in the actualization of a latent historical potential. The political impotence of this dialectic of potential and actual is evident, reducing as it does historical change to possibility awaiting its inevitable realization.</p>
<p>Recent European thought has grappled with a number of different approaches to the deconstruction of this metaphysical couple of potential and actual, among them the Deleuzian virtual, the Derridean l’à-venir, Agamben’s inoperosità and Badiou’s theory of the Event. I see in these positions a continuum between two poles of absolute determination: necessity at one end and impossibility at the other. What interests me in this paper is the attempt, most fully realized in the thought of Agamben and Badiou, to uphold instead the category of contingency: the dual possibility that-it-may-or-may-not-be. “The essence of the impossible,” claims Badiou, “amounts to being deaf to the voice of the time. Thus is created a prepolitical situation whose principle…is the interruption of the ordinary social hearing.”</p>
<p>What is this exceptional hearing that reconfigures the relation of actual and potential and inaugurates radical historical change? In what way can listening be revolutionary? And, by thinking of listening in this way, how does this position music in relation to the Marxian division of production and ideology, historical and dialectical materialisms? I argue that music not only has a stake in but is also capable of reconfiguring historical materialism’s relation to potentiality.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Music, Technology, Music-As-Technology</p>
<p class="abs-author">Eric Drott (University of Texas at Austin)</p>
<p>A theme in recent scholarship treats music not merely as mediated by technology, but as itself a form of technology. Notable is the rich vein of work that has built upon Tia DeNora’s influential studies of individuals’ use of music as a “technology of the self.” However, the notion of technology employed in such accounts often remains undertheorized. Or, when it is theorized, it is done so in abstract, transhistorical terms—which is to say in idealist terms.</p>
<p>This paper offers by contrast a materialist reading of music as technology. This is beneficial on two accounts. First, such an approach offers a useful counterpoint to the neo-pragmatism that informs existing treatments of music as technology, treatments whose insights are largely confined to a microsociological level. Generally lacking has been sustained reflection on how the work of music operates within a broader political economy. Second, taking seriously the proposition that music is to be construed as itself a technology offers a way past some of the impasses in which traditional Marxian accounts of music have led (reflection vs. anticipation, art vs. commerce). Rather than treat music as an element of the superstructure, rather than ruminate on the processes by which music has been progressively commodified (or has resisted commodification), the reading offered here insists instead upon music’s productivity: how music, as means of production, is recruited for the fabrication of laboring bodies, subjectivities, cognitive capacities, affective states, and other commodities necessary for the ongoing reproduction of capital.</p>
