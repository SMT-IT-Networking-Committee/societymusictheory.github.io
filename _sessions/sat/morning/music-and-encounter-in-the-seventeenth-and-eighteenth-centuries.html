<p class="abs-title">Cavalli, Communiques, and the Kremlin: Muscovite Witnesses to Seventeenth-century Italian Music and Theater</p>

<p>When the Russian ambassador Vasilii Likhachev witnessed a theatrical performance in Florence in 1660, he truly did not have words to describe what he saw. There were flying horses, oceans with fish, floating clouds, and battle scenes—all this appeared in what he described as a series of little rooms, which seemed to appear and then disappear, replaced by ever-more-astonishing actions. Likhachev’s mission was one of several large Russian diplomatic embassies sent to the West in the period from the late 1650s through the 1680s, and extending throughout the Continent, from Italy to Spain to England. Not only do these diplomats provide wide-eyed descriptions of staged performances to which they were taken, particularly in Florence and Venice, but their own activities were closely reported by various representatives from their hosts and from the surrounding states. (Indeed, word apparently spread among Western officials of the Russians’ enthusiasm for theatrical spectacle, which they willingly supplied in ever-increasing magnificence.) Compiling and comparing these reports reveals new information about music and theater history in both Russia and the West. Combining Likhachev’s description with information from his hosts, for example, shows that the production that so amazed the Russian diplomat used sets originally constructed for Cavalli’s <em>Ipermestra</em>, a context that was apparently explained to the ambassador, who repeated it in his own account. And because these theatrical experiences coincide with (and may even have helped to stimulate) Russian plans to create their own court theater, in the early 1670s, these reports can serve to document the increasingly important communications networks throughout Europe and their impact on musical and theatrical developments in Russia during this period.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Inventing Eastern Europe in the Ear of the Enlightenment</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kevin C. Karnes (Emory University)</p>

<p>In his landmark study <em>Inventing Eastern Europe</em> (1994), the historian Larry Wolff documented the first attempts to partition the continent imaginatively into Western and Eastern domains. This partitioning, he argues, was undertaken by writers from Europe’s eighteenth-century hubs of Enlightenment, who traveled into Imperial Russia and wrote about their experiences abroad. In their accounts of travel, these writers “intellectually combin[ed]” easterly geographies and peoples “into a coherent whole,” and then “compar[ed]” that whole with westerly spaces, thereby “establishing the developmental division of the continent.” In this way, they conjured an image of Eastern Europe to contrast starkly with life in the West. While scholars across the humanities have embraced Wolff’s analysis (e.g., Bohlman 2011, Baker 2010, Todorova 2009), I suggest that its picture of Europe’s imaginative partitioning is limited by its ocular-centric readings of Enlightenment texts: Wolff is principally concerned with what travelers reportedly <em>saw</em> as they ventured east. A different picture emerges, however, if we consider what travelers <em>heard</em> alongside what they saw. Focusing on accounts of listening provided by such early travelers to Russia as the philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, the Hebraist Johann Joachim Bellermann, and the grammarian Gotthard Friedrich Stender, I discuss how the aural registers of their experiences alternately enrich and confound ocular-centric accounts of Europe’s imaginary division. Where these travelers saw foreign peoples and scenes, they sometimes heard familiar musics; where they saw an undifferentiated mass of individuals, they often heard a diversity of voices. Drawing on theoretical work by the media scholar Lisa Gitelman on written accounts of auditory experience (1999) and by the ethnomusicologist Ana Maria Ochoa Gautier on the impact of the listener on the audible field (2014), I argue that travelers’ habits of listening deeply inflected their ethnographic imaginings, and vice versa. And I suggest that attuning to those habits of listening reveals the Enlightenment inventing of Eastern Europe to be a far more complex and conflicted project than widely acknowledged today.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Old Lisbon, New Rome: Marginalized Voices in Early Eighteenth-Century Portuguese Villancico and Oratorio</p>
<p class="abs-author">Danielle M. Kuntz (Baldwin Wallace University)</p>

<p>Scholarly analyses of Iberian music commonly acknowledge the pervasive influence of Italian musical styles across Portugal and Spain during the eighteenth century. Yet, in spite of the active sponsorship of Italian music by Iberian patrons during this period—Domenico Scarlatti’s employment at the Portuguese and Spanish courts is a well-known example—the Iberian musical community responded in complex ways to the influx of Italian musicians and styles. In this paper, I chart a changing musical power dynamic in early eighteenth-century Lisbon, where King João V’s success in his political and religious quest to transform Lisbon into a “New Rome” meant the sudden disenfranchisement of many Portuguese and Spanish composers, poets, and performers.</p>
<p>Specifically, I draw on archival material to examine the politicized introduction of oratorio to Lisbon’s musical life between 1719 and 1723. During this time, a sizeable contingent from Lisbon’s distinguished Iberian musical community innovated the expansion of the customary villancico performances at Lisbon’s Sé Cathedral to include a new style of Iberian vernacular oratorio—the earliest known productions of this genre in Portugal. Although the music has been lost, the printed chapbooks of these oratorios, and the villancicos to which they were paired, not only reveal subversive political texts, but also betray the sumptuousness of the resulting musical spectacle through detailed annotations that indicate diverse styles, textures, and instrumentations. Moreover, these documents name approximately twenty contributors, both local (such as Jayme de la Te y Sagau and Julião Maciel) and more distant (such as Antonio Literes and Francesc Valls), who supplied text or music for the new works. I posit that these villancicos and oratorios served as a last attempt by an elite Iberian musical community to legitimize their work through a blended Ibero-Italian paraliturgical musical product. Although the project proved futile—the productions were completely abandoned with João V’s implementation of the Roman Rite in Lisbon’s parish churches in 1723—this paper gives voice to the political and musical figures who struggled to find a place in the transitioning Iberian soundscape.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Smudged Blotches, Glued Paste-overs, and Crosshatched Rewrites: Uncovering Sumaya’s <em>Murió por el pecado</em> and His Compositional Process</p>
<p class="abs-author">Craig Russell (Cal Poly)</p>

<p>Few composers influenced the Hispano-American world more than Manuel de Sumaya. From his post as Chapel Master of the Mexico City Cathedral, he introduced New Spain to the European “high Baroque.” He was the first American to compose cantatas. He established the first standing orchestra in the New World and became the first to introduce the recitative and aria styles to New Spain. Additionally, his musical dramas <em>Rodrigo</em> (1708) and <em>Partenope</em> (1711) established him as the first American-born composer to have composed operas. Sumaya’s groundbreaking contributions have long been acknowledged, but almost nothing has been known about Sumaya’s actual compositional <em>process</em>—until now.</p>
<p>The material that reveals this process has been hiding in plain sight. If we lift the cover to Legajo 78/27 in the Mexico City Cathedral Archive, we find the score for <em>Cielo y mundo</em> (a polychoral, concerted Christmas <em>villancico</em>). But sewn to the back of this piece, we find another separate, unrelated, and previously “undiscovered” work, <em>Murió por el pecado</em>, which is a four-movement cantata for soprano, strings, and continuo, intended for Corpus Christi. The text alludes to standard religious metaphors and also to Mexican imagery (Guadalupe and <em>maté</em> cultivation). Not only does this discovery add yet another musical jewel to the extant Sumaya repertoire, but more importantly, this manuscript provides—for the first time—invaluable clues as to <em>how</em> Sumaya actually drafted, revised, and polished his works. Notably, this folder contains the <em>only</em> known manuscripts in Sumaya’s hand to be written out in score format (as opposed to separate performance parts). How could this cantata have been overlooked? At first glance, <em>Murió</em> seems to be a hodgepodge of pitches, messy text, smudges, snippets of pasted-over corrections, and expansive globs of crossed out material—more an explosion of chaos than an actual “finished work.” But this paper will demonstrate that with painstaking care (and an intimate knowledge of Sumaya’s notational idiosyncrasies), we actually <em>do</em> have a retrievable, polished composition and—perhaps more importantly—we have a record of the work’s compositional stages (much like a Beethoven sketchbook).</p>
