<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>The editing and textual criticism of Bruckner’s symphonies confront a set of problems as notoriously complex as those found with any composer’s works. Bruckner’s methods of composition and especially revision were complicated to begin with, and attempts by twentieth-century scholars to explain this topic confused as well as clarified. Beginning in the 1930s a group of Austrian scholars, led by Robert Haas, revolutionized the understanding of Bruckner’s works by arguing that previous editors had altered his scores without his permission or had coerced the composer into making ill-advised changes. The first Bruckner Collected Works Edition, edited by Haas between 1932 and 1944, accordingly set out to reclaim Bruckner’s pure Urtexts, freed of external influences and additions. This approach was highly influential; for the past eight decades Bruckner scholars, critics, and performers have invested almost exclusively in these “original” versions, while great suspicion lingers concerning what have long been construed as unfortunate editorial intrusions in many early editions.</p>
<p>Now, with ongoing archival and text-critical research generating significant new insights into Bruckner’s compositional activity, traditional conclusions about the texts of his symphonies are being called into question. The fruits of this work are beginning to appear in the New Anton Bruckner Collected Works Edition that begins publication this year. It is, then, an opportune moment to scrutinize the complex of issues involved in evaluating and understanding the texts of Bruckner’s major works.</p>

<p>In November 1893, after a series of publications and successful performances, Anton Bruckner signed his will. He bequeathed the autograph manuscripts of his major works to the Imperial Library and stipulated that his engraver, Josef Eberle, should borrow them for future editions. Only years later did it become clear that, in many cases, the readings in the manuscripts differed, often substantially, from those in his contemporary editions. In 1932 the Bruckner <em>Gesamtausgabe</em> began to base all its scores on the manuscripts because, in the words of its principal editor, Robert Haas, the first editions contained arrangements “with extensive cuts and massive orchestration changes . . . that have no verifiable connection with the master.” The composer designed his will, so the argument went, to preserve the correct readings in the library “for later times.”</p>
<p>The collected works edition provoked one of the most vitriolic debates in the history of musicology. Scholars such as Friedrich Blume, Hans Ferdinand Redlich, and Deryck Cooke supported Haas, while Egon Wellesz and eventually Haas’s co-editor, Alfred Orel, were among the many who argued for the first editions. More recent scholarship has shown that while Haas was correct about many of the contemporary printed editions, he was wrong, at least as far as the first editions of the Third and Fourth Symphonies are concerned. Ironically, these readings, which Bruckner publicly praised, are among those that differ most from the manuscripts he left to the library. How does one reconcile these contradictions? To what extent should the will influence editorial policy when source-critical evidence dictates otherwise?</p>
<p>The present paper begins with a fresh look at Bruckner’s working relationship with two of his most important editors, Franz and Josef Schalk, and specific events of 1893 that influenced the language of the will. It then parses the pertinent passage, concluding that the composer never intended the document to influence postmortem editorial decisions. The paper concludes with guidelines the <em>New Anton Bruckner Collected Works Edition</em> is using to establish a hierarchy of sources for Bruckner’s individual works.</p>


<p class="abs-title">“It Will Now Achieve Its Effect”: Toward a Longer View of the Processes of Symphonic Composition</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benjamin Korstvedt (Clark University)</p>

<p>The primary investment of musical source studies is ordinarily in recapturing what Stefan Zweig called the “mysterious moment of transition in which . . . a melody, emerges out of the vision and intuition of a genius.” This pursuit informs most investigations of the compositional process and even much critical editing. While such work has revealed a great deal, it also tends to narrow our view by fostering the belief that composition is an essentially private matter aloof from merely practical concerns, let alone winning audience approval.</p>
<p>By focusing on an exemplary case, this presentation will demonstrate that an overemphasis on the value of these early stages constrains understanding of the longer span of the compositional process, especially when dealing with a large, public genre such as the symphony. It draws on my intensive study of all extant primary sources of Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony in showing that the history of its composition—which covered some fifteen years—is only fully understood when seen in its full span, extending well beyond initial conception to the achievement of a finished text able, as Bruckner put it, to “achieve its effect.”</p>
<p>The later stages of this process primarily addressed practical matters attendant on the effective performance of a big symphonic work by a large ensemble for a broad audience. This naturally involved the refinement and clarification of orchestration, tempo, dynamics, and other performance matters. Yet, as the presentation will reveal, in these later stages Bruckner also made substantive formal changes (some of which have been uncovered only by my research), particularly in the Finale, which he revised repeatedly before and after the work’s early performances. Much of this late-stage work involved outside input and even collaboration with other musicians in ways that challenge conventional ideas about the nature of authentic musical creation, but no doubt exists that Bruckner regarded the end result as fully valid. The presentation concludes that while the extent of this pragmatic phase of this symphony’s composition was exceptional, this sort of late-stage, collaborative work is a normal part of the compositional process of any major public composition.</p>
