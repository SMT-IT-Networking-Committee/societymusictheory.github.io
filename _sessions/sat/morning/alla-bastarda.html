<p class="abs-title">Transgendered Voices in Early Modern Italy: <em>Cantare alla bastarda</em>, Everyday Virtuosity, and Performing Otherness</p>

<p>Scholarship on the canzonetta in early modern Italy emphasizes its stylistic relation to the madrigal (DeFord) and the development of solo genres (Ossi). Canzonettas that require polyphonic performance for their effect have remained unexplored, including those employing <em>cantare alla bastarda</em>, a technique that sheds light on the construction of identity through song. The tradition of virtuosic vocal <em>alla bastarda</em> performance, in which a wide-ranging, embellished solo paraphrases a polyphonic composition, flourished from the 1580s to the 1620s (Wistreich). However, a different <em>alla bastarda</em> style appears in sixteen three-voice canzonettas by Orazio Vecchi and Adriano Banchieri published between 1597 and 1607. Unlike the solo technique, in the <em>alla bastarda</em> canzonetta singers create audible distinctions between male and female characters in dialogues, switching octaves by alternating chest voice and falsetto. Aside from the wide vocal range, these pieces do not call for particular virtuosity, lacking melodic embellishments or novel dissonances. Banchieri wrote that <em>La pazzia senile</em> (1598), in which he uses the technique, was sung recreationally by three friends.</p>
<p>Both composers exploit the awkwardness of registral contrast in all-male singing to depict courtesans, impotent old men, and comic Others through <em>cantare alla bastarda</em>, reinscribing hierarchies of gender and class. Such pieces are distinct from serious canzonettas in the same books that are sung in falsetto throughout, though after 1600 Banchieri increasingly recommended using six singers of conventional ranges in performances of his collections. However, in <em>Le veglie di Siena</em> (1604), Vecchi uses <em>cantare alla bastarda</em> to depict a female partygoer parodying the voices of two Jews. Since <em>Veglie</em> was printed in six part-books, of which this piece uses only three, the <em>alla bastarda</em> texture is clearly intrinsic to this effect, and is lost if Banchieri’s six-voice option is taken. Many editors have transcribed these pieces in six-voice scores, erasing the novel technique altogether. Preserving the <em>cantare alla bastarda</em> texture in editorial and performance practice restores the fluid identities that singers experienced in this music and conveys a sense of how musical recreation constructed social relationships in the early modern period.</p>

<p>In 1567 Giovanni de’ Bardi was eyewitness to a performance in Rome by a famous bass singer, whose virtuosic display probably places him in that special category of bass singers known as <em>bassi alla bastarda</em>. Aside from the pioneering work of musicologist Richard Wistreich on the “warrior, courtier, [and] singer” Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, there has been little attention given to the practices of <em>bassi alla bastarda</em> and the inherent tensions that their particular style of vocality invoked in broader contemporary discourse. Bardi, for example, was consumed by <em>meraviglia</em> [wonder] at the 1567 performance at same time that it literally filled him with nausea.</p>
<p>One type of standard <em>bastarda</em> practice required the solo bass singer to traverse the vertical “terrain” of a (typically) four-part musical composition by leaping between various parts at will, potentially expanding his “natural” voice to a range of three octaves. The <em>bastarda</em> soloist thus dispersed his corporeal-vocal practices in a way that defied the discreet role of the bass singer as musical foundation. In so doing, he transformed notated composition anew through performance; at times, the original composition might be all but eviscerated in the <em>bastarda</em> performance. In instances such as these, the performer moves so far away from the music in its notated form that, according to Bardi, “even the composer does not recognize it [the music] as his offspring.” The corporeal connotations of Bardi’s reference to the term <em>creatura</em>—translated here as “offspring”—could call into question the authoritative position of the composer as progenitor; in such cases the “bastard” performer became the generator, in the sense of one who creates or reproduces.</p>
<p>This paper explores the anti-mimetic, anamorphic dimensions of <em>bastarda</em> performance practice as an important strand of renaissance and early baroque musical culture. I argue that the bodily dimension of <em>bastarda</em> singing (as well as the connotations related to the designation itself) reflected broader tensions during this period: tensions between the natural and artificial, notated musical “texts” and their performative realizations, and the potential for perceived dissolution of both musical and social order.</p>
