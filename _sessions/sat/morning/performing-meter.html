<p class="abs-title">Creaking Chairs and Metric Clarity: Microtiming Glenn Gould Recording Schoenberg op. 19/1</p>
<p class="abs-author">Richard Beaudoin (Brandeis University / The Royal Academy of Music, London)</p>

<p>The audible creaking of Glenn Gould’s beloved, loose-jointed, swaying piano chair—fashioned by his father and used throughout his career—has historically been a subject for apologetic liner notes and recording-studio memoirs. Along with his vocal sounds, such creaks are integral to Gould’s interpretations; they are part of what we might love, or hate, about his recordings. Developing Sanden’s theory of corporeal liveness, the creaks are considered here as “sounded movements” of Gould’s body.</p>
<p>Nested-square diagrams created with the Lucerne Audio Recording Analyser [LARA] are used to present millisecond-level measurements of the number and location of all sound events—including each chair creak—in Gould’s 1965 recording of Schoenberg’s op. 19/1. Broadening the scope of earlier microtiming methodologies, this approach records onset timings of so-called “ambient noises” alongside the piano music. Blending these categories, sounds created by Gould’s body (and equipment) are understood as part of each phrase and gesture.</p>
<p>Schoenberg’s op. 19/1 exhibits greater rhythmic, registral, and even tonal stability as it progresses to its end. Indeed, theorists have long singled out this seventeen-measure work for its unique metrical unfolding. Marrying analytical literature with microtiming data reveals a correlation between the composition’s trajectory of metric clarification and the decrease in Gould’s physical activity. Quantifying sounds that are normally marginalized, this paper connects sound studies, theory, and performance analysis, fusing theoretical observations about Schoenberg’s composition with the artifacts of Gould’s corporeality.</p>

<p>Discussion of temporal periodicity in music typically considers meter, perception, and listening together: to experience <em>meter</em> means <em>perceiving</em> temporal hierarchy by <em>listening</em> to sounds. The mainstream psychological model, developed primarily by Mari Riess Jones (1995, 1999, 2006) and Justin London (2002, 2004), focuses upon a process of “attending,” in which one’s attention synchronizes with periodicities of external sound stimuli. Their model draws upon a corpus of laboratory experiments in which participants listen to sound recordings. However, those participants did not, for example, <em>see</em> a conductor’s gestures, or a musical score. The result is a “listener-oriented” perspective: music in time is treated primarily as something heard, rather than something produced. Musical contexts outside controlled laboratory experiments, on the other hand, are not bound by such restrictions.</p>
<p>I explore two examples of metric “multi-tasking” from a performer’s perspective in order to highlight additional types of knowledge that are useful for navigating musical periodicity, whether or not that knowledge is considered perceptual or aural. In a Brad Mehldau trio recording of “Anthropology” and Meredith Monk’s “Panda Chant II,” individual musicians follow two non-nested pulse hierarchies at the same time, but attention (as currently theorized) cannot simply entrain with both. Additional strategies—which may utilize abstract, symbolic, or multi-modal resources—are necessary. I argue that these strategies can apply to normative metric situations as well as rhythmic pedagogy. Discussing them also helps disentangle the concepts of meter, perception, and listening.</p>
