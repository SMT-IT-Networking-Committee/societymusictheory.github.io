<p>This special session addresses the related topics of implicit bias in
academic settings and proposes concrete ways for all members of academic
communities to create an inclusive music curriculum and classroom. The session
has two parts. Part I is led by Dr. Betty Jean Taylor, University of Texas at
Austin, and Dr. Claudia García-Louis, University of Texas at San Antonio. Drs.
Taylor and García-Louis are experts in minimizing implicit biases and in
showing how biases affect hiring, peer review and other forms of academic
evaluation. Taylor and García-Louis present not only on how decision-making
processes in a college/university setting may affirm biases about race,
ethnicity, and sexuality but also on how to overcome such biases to create an
inclusive curriculum. Part II of the session is a roundtable discussion with
music faculty about specific ways to create an inclusive curriculum and
classroom that recognizes the intersectionality of issues of gender, race,
ethnicity, and sexuality. </p>
