<p>Investigations of how people have used music to represent, perform, enact,
and cope with trauma have proliferated in the last decade. Scholars have drawn
on myriad theories of trauma to examine relationships between music and trauma
for Holocaust survivors, Cold War- and glasnost-era Eastern European
musicians, and civilians and soldiers in Iraq. However, despite the growing
interest in trauma within music scholarship, there has been scant attention
paid to relationships between musical phenomena and trauma prior to World War
II. And yet, the wars, revolutions, forced displacement, slavery, and
imperialism of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries make these
years some of the most violent in the histories of modern Europe and the
Americas, and thus some of the most important to address when asking questions
regarding relationships between music and trauma.</p>

<p>Building on the success of last year’s “Musicology and Trauma Studies”
panel, this panel—a preview for a <i>Nineteenth-Century Music Review</i>
special issue—addresses this gap in scholarship by investigating how the
cultures of imperial Britain and France, the Mexican-American War, and the US
Civil War engaged with music to articulate and cope with trauma. Although
scholars have often considered Freud a central figure within trauma studies,
this panel’s participants challenge his centrality by relying upon pre- and
post-Freudian conceptions of trauma, investigating musical practices through
socio-historically specific understandings of what was variously understood by
psychologists, philosophers, medical professionals and the public as hysteria,
melancholy, shell shock, or <i>commotion</i>. Elizabeth Morgan and Sarah Gerk
address, respectively, how battle pieces and lament songs created empathy
among listeners and performers during the Mexican-American War, and how for
Irish Americans during the US Civil War, lament songs from the Irish famine
were used to express trauma of both events. Erin Brooks investigates Sarah
Bernhardt’s role in articulating cultural trauma in Paris during the
Franco-Prussian War. Finally, Michelle Meinhart and Jillian Rogers examine how
music functioned during World War I, providing insights into music’s use in
shell shock therapy for soldiers convalescing at the Craiglockhart Hospital,
and into how Maurice Ravel’s <i>Le Tombeau de Couperin </i>(1917),
<i>Frontispice</i> (1918), and <i>La Valse </i>(1920) might be
understood—through the theoretical conceptions of trauma of psychoanalysts
Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok—as sonic manifestations of trauma. </p>

<p>Following each panelist’s overview of her research, there will be a
roundtable discussion focusing on the question of how music scholars might
engage with theoretical conceptions of trauma in addressing musical phenomena
that predates many of the most lasting understandings of trauma. In addition
to moving one step further towards creating a Music and Trauma AMS Study
Group, this panel sheds new light on the meaning of music and musical
practices in the contexts of war in the long nineteenth century, while also
articulating the importance of and significant possibilities for new
frameworks by which trauma theory might be employed in historical studies of
music. </p>
