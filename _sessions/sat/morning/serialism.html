<p class="abs-title">Elliott Carter’s and Luigi Nono’s Analyses of Schoenberg’s
  Variations for Orchestra Op. 31: Divergent Approaches to Serialism </p>
<p class="abs-author">Laura Emmery (Emory University)</p>

<p>Elliott Carter’s theoretical foundation and compositional practice differed distinctively from that of his contemporary, Luigi Nono. While Nono was primarily invested in the twelve-tone system, Carter devised his own harmonic language based on all-interval tetrachords, seeking to distance himself from the growing trend of serialism. Despite their divergent compositional aesthetic and opposing views on the applicability of twelve-tone music, the two composers shared their admiration for the works of the Second Viennese School. In this paper, I examine Carter’s 1957 and Nono’s 1956 analyses of Schoenberg’s <i>Variations for Orchestra</i>, Op. 31. The analyses, housed at the Paul Sacher Stiftung and Fondazione Archivio Luigi Nono, illuminate aspects of Schoenberg’s work that each composer found most compelling and applicable to their own works.</p>
<p>They allow us to understand which of Schoenberg’s techniques served as the basis of their own system. Thus, this study not only offers a rare opportunity to look at one same piece analyzed by two composers with unique points of view, but it shows how Schoenberg influenced two schools of thought.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Webern’s Late Cyclicism: Music So “Loose” but More “Strict”
  than Ever Before</p>
<p class="abs-author">Brian Moseley (University at Buffalo)</p>

<p>At Christmas in 1939, Webern wrote to Hildegard Jone with a copy of his new cantata movement—a setting of Jone’s “Kleiner Flügel Ahornsamen”—along with an intriguing description:</p>
<blockquote>[H]owever freely it seems to float around—possibly music has never before known anything so loose—it is the product of a regular procedure more strict, possibly, than anything that has formed the basis of a musical conception before.</blockquote>
<p>Webern’s description revels in a paradox originating in Jone’s poem, wherein the fluttering fall of a maple seed (“Ahornsamen”) is contrasted with its predestined and highly determined growth into a new tree. Both Jone’s poem and Webern’s musical setting are beautiful artistic imaginings of Emmanuel Swedenborg’s “theory of correspondences,” a concept which asserts that “the whole natural world corresponds to the spiritual world.”</p>
<p>Large cycles are an important way that Webern’s setting expresses these ideas. Though under-explored in literature about Webern’s music, cycles are typical means of organization in his late work and were used in a wonderful variety of ways. Using music drawn from a variety of compositions, I argue in this talk that large cycles functioned as generators of musical form and manifestations of his spiritual and artistic philosophy. “Kleiner Flügel Ahornsamen,” from the First Cantata, Op. 29, is a touchstone example used to describe this view of organization—one that hinges on the idea of music “so loose” but “more strict” than ever before.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Proliferation of Serial Processes in the Early Music of Bruno
  Maderna</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christoph Neidhöfer (McGill University)</p>

<p>After World-war II, composers of the younger generation in Italy—like elsewhere—searched for radically new creative approaches. The leading figure was Bruno Maderna (1920-1973), who invented a distinct serial technique whose mechanisms and political implications had a profound impact on others, especially Luigi Nono and Luciano Berio. While recent scholarship has examined Maderna’s mature serial technique (Borio, Fein, Neidhöfer, Rizzardi, etc.), its roots and earliest development have received less attention.</p>
<p>This paper demonstrates how Maderna invented a wide range of row techniques before embarking on his mature matrix technique around 1951. Focusing on two early key works, <i>Composizione n. 1</i> for orchestra (1948-49) and <i>Studi per “Il processo” di F. Kafka</i> (1949-50), I show how Maderna’s gradual adoption of serialism closely tied in with his deep-seated humanism, in his quest for new forms of expression by means of a compositional technique untainted by fascism. Maderna (1953-54) described his later, complex permutation technique as resembling “the technique of life in its becoming.” With evidence from his sketches I argue that he conceptualized serial procedures as a symbol of life from early on and that it was in fact the ramifications of this symbolism that motivated him to embrace serialism in the first place.</p>
<p>In <i>Composizione n. 1</i> Maderna programmatically anthropomor-phizes themes and tone rows, as he indicates with titles in the score, without showing how this works, however. In the Kafka Studies the series associated with the politically suppressed “freely” mutate, symbolizing the characters’ struggle for liberty and justice. </p>

<p class="abs-title">Vestiges of Serialism in Helmut Lachenmann’s Compositional
  Method</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benjamin Downs (Stony Brook University)</p>

<p>This paper argues that the “serial principle” continued to play a significant but unrecognized role in Helmut Lachenmann’s compositional method, well after his creation of concepts that supposedly replaced it. The composer himself admits that serial thinking remained formative to his compositional process, but recent historical and theoretical accounts gloss over this fact to mark his 1966 theory of sound-types (“<i>Klang-typen</i>”) and his concept of <i>musique concrete instrumentale </i>as his compositional <i>Stunde Null</i>. Through a discussion of findings in the sketches for his works from the late 1960s and 1970s, I show how serial principles persist in Lachenmann’s compositional method through at least 1978.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the sketches for his 1968 <i>tem-A</i> and especially his<i> </i>1977 <i>Salut für Caudwell</i>, which show his deployment of <i>Klangtypen</i> not as a governing category, but as one of four equal categories. The other three appear in the sketches as “Intensity” (“<i>Intens</i>.” or “<i>Intensität</i>”), “Rhythm Pattern” (“<i>Modell-Rythmus</i>” or “<i>Rhythmus Modell</i>”), and “Duo-type” (“<i>Duo-typ</i>”). These categories are further complicated by his use of a classical twelve-tone row, a duration series, and a matrix of 6 interrelated “Playing types” (“<i>Spiel-typen</i>”), each organized according to quasi-serial processes. By showing how Lachenmann continued to employ parametric thinking, I join Irna Priore and Martin Iddon in demonstrating the afterlife of high modernist serialism – how the spectres of Darmstadt continue to haunt post-Darmstadt musical composition.</p>
