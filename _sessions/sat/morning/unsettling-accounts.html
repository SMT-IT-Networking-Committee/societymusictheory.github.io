<p>This panel explores ways that new compositions and arrangements can make
lost music part of our historical imagination. The participants look at two
types of music identified with enslaved people: the vanished works of the
African, Joseph Antonia Emidy (1775–1835) and the Portuguese <i>modinha</i>
(c.1780–1820). Performances by Tunde Jegede and Žak Ozmo, along with position
papers and discussion, will illuminate a transatlantic music witnessed above
all in artefacts, traditions and accounts. The panelists propose two solutions
for bringing such repertories out of the shadows: writing or arranging music
to narrate history, and explaining how this music illuminates sources that
inspired it. Emidy’s music and Portuguese modinhas lie between orality and
archives. The Guinean Emidy shared the fate of millions of west Africans: he
was captured as a child in Africa, sold to Portuguese traders and transported,
in his case to Brazil.</p>

<p>But unlike most slaves, Emidy then traveled to Europe and became a
professional violinist in Lisbon. His musical excellence led to his second
enslavement, from 1795, when the English frigate captain Sir Edward Pellew,
seeing a black man in the opera band, ordered Emidy’s kidnapping and
impressment as the ship’s fiddler. In 1799 Emidy was freed in Cornwall, where
he became a locally renowned composer. No notation survives; we know of
Emidy’s output only through British notices after 1795. Unlike Emidy’s works,
modinhas survive as scores. Possibly invented by the Brazilian mixed-race poet
Domingos Caldas Barbosa (1740–1800), the genre came to be cultivated by
several Portuguese composers. But scores don’t capture how modinhas might have
been executed, according to apposite evidence. Combining Brazilian, West
African and art song traditions, modinhas require the integration of all three
for their reinvention.</p>

<p>Transatlantic music-making bound together three continents that its
creators moved between. The panel presentation is structured to “sound” this
lost music—that is, explore its depths and properties—through performance and
scholarly debate. The panel opens with ten minutes of Jegede’s music, created
as part of his research into Emidy. Two position papers then follow. The first
presenter, Jegede, introduces audiences to Emidy’s extraordinary journey and
explains how Jegede and his collaborators interpret Emidy’s legacy by
combining creative practice with primary source reports. For Jegede, recording
becomes a means to extend oral traditions and to bring Emidy’s music back into
a transatlantic cycle. In the second position paper, Berta Joncus identifies
clashes in reports about Emidy’s music during and after his lifetime, linking
these contradictions to contemporary biases, and proposing ways to reconsider
Emidy’s impact. The discussion is then thrown open to the floor for fifteen
minutes: what is the potential for using twenty-first-century music to tell
music history? Ozmo will then, over twenty minutes, perform a selection of
modinhas, interlacing these songs with explanations of his archival sources
and their shortcomings, and clarifying the modinha’s impact outside Portugal.
A concluding debate, chaired by Naomi André and with input from Michael Veal,
will summarize findings and encourage audience feedback on new ways to
conceptualize transatlantic musical culture.</p>
