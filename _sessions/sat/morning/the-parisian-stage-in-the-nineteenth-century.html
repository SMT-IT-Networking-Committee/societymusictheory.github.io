<p class="abs-title">The “Girouette” Effect: <em>Les Pages du duc de Vendôme</em> and Political Iconography in 1820</p>
<p class="abs-author">Anna McCready (Royal College of Music)</p>

<p>The paper examines the single-act ballet <em>Les Pages du duc de Vendôme</em>, a propagandist stage-work by Gersin and Dieulafoi premiered at the Opéra in 1820. The ballet was presented as the Opéra’s “new” <em>pièce de circonstance</em> for the birth of the Duc de Bordeaux, the intended heir to the Bourbon throne. This highly successful Restoration ballet was uncharacteristic of the politically constrained <em>circonstance</em> genre, in that it took its name, plot, and characters from an Empire vaudeville of 1807, also by Gersin and Dieulafoi. I call this this vaulting across constitutional change the “girouette” or “weathervane” effect. As one of the most revealing theatrical girouettes, <em>Les Pages</em> was embedded with allegory, iconography, and political innuendo that belonged to Napoleon’s political machine, and which has been previously unaddressed in scholarship. In its new Restoration context, the dramatic plot, the location, and the character names of <em>Les Pages</em> (particularly Marimon, who allegorizes the Empire and Restoration Marshall Marmont, and the Duc de Vendôme, who allegorizes Napoleon and Louis XVIII) provided a deep stratum of political ambiguity. The emerging conflation of Empire and Bourbon symbols in this now disregarded ballet infuses it with great significance for scholarly understanding of the Restoration. This paper examines possible reasons why this Empire propagandist work escaped the Bourbon censor. In this paper, I demonstrate how the accommodation of Napoleonic symbols, exemplified in <em>Les Pages</em> and promoted by the girouette effect, helped to promote an atmosphere of conciliation and to quell unspent revolutionary tensions within France’s fractured society. This perception of the girouette effect as a functional element of conciliation reconfigures the envelope of current research (Hibberd, 2009; Walton, 2003, 2007). Both Hibberd and Walton have proposed that phenomena (a mute dancer, Swiss scenery) diverted audiences’ attention from issues of revolution within late-Restoration works. This paper proposes that the girouette effect, during the early 1820s, provides a pre-existing lens through which we can examine the suppression or non-interest in the revolutionary spirit in works of the late Restoration. My paper proposes, then, that the girouette effect is a vital formant of the early French Restoration Zeitgeist.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Beyond Opera and Musical Theater: Rethinking Nineteenth- Century Parisian Theater with Music through the Lens of <em>Féerie</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Tommaso Sabbatini (University of Chicago)</p>

<p><em>Féerie</em>, the French fairy play, was a conspicuous presence on the nineteenth-century stage, yet it has been long neglected by scholars. The last decade has seen a few interventions in the fields of theater history (notably by Roxane Martin) and film studies (by scholars of Georges Méliès), but musicological contributions are still wanting. Musicology, though, would be well equipped for dealing with a genre that, like opera and melodrama, relies in equal measure on verbal, musical, and visual elements.</p>
<p>In this paper I will present some results of my ongoing study of <em>féerie</em> between 1870 and 1900, based on a wide variety of historical evidence—including, but not limited to, a substantive repertoire of works, hitherto mostly ignored and in part unpublished. Far from being a time of decline for <em>féerie</em> as commonly claimed, the fin de siècle witnessed its exceptional vitality and capacity for adaptation. Some <em>féerie</em>s abandoned patchwork scores compiled by house conductors in favor of fully original scores commissioned to well-known composers (the first example is Victorien Sardou and Jacques Offenbach’s <em>Le roi Carotte</em>, 1872); some renounced the traditional fairy-tale subjects for scientific ones (Adolphe d’Ennery’s adaptations from Jules Verne; Offenbach’s <em>Le voyage dans la lune</em>, 1875); and finally, Georges Méliès transferred <em>féerie</em> from the stage to the new medium of film.</p>
<p>As a prominent genre that was neither literary nor operatic, <em>féerie</em> challenges scholars of nineteenth-century Parisian theater to abandon the traditional bipartition between spoken and musical theater—the latter further split into two camps, operetta and opera—and focus instead on genres, institutions, and the vast area of theater with music (melodrama, operetta, <em>vaudeville</em>, opera, revue, military play), whose full appreciation has been impeded by anachronistic taxonomies.</p>
<p>I will discuss the economy, the ideology, and the poetics of <em>féerie</em>, and I will appraise its role at a decisive juncture for the development of the media of modernity. In fact, as a form of popular entertainment at the center of the media landscape of the “capital of the nineteenth century,” <em>féerie</em> affords privileged insight into the nascent phase of mass culture.</p>
