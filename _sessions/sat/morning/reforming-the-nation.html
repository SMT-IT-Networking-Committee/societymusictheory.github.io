<p class="abs-title">Listening to Another Italy: New Music for Ancestral Legacies in 1960s Italian Documentaries</p>
<p class="abs-author">Marco Cosci (Fondazione Giorgio Cini)</p>

<p>The transition between the fifties and sixties is a watershed moment for the construction of postwar Italian identity through cinema. A new generation of directors is deeply interested in exploring the historical and political legacy of World War II, the changes in the processes of industrialization, as well as rural culture in danger of extinction. Not only feature films of those years reflect this critical point, but also, and foremost, documentaries become a privileged medium to reveal the contradictions of a country that was increasingly divided between tradition and progress. Whereas much scholarship has been devoted to narrative agency of music in feature film, sound in documentary film has received little scholarly attention. However, as documentary theorists have already clearly shown, documentaries are always a representation of the world (Nichols 2010), not only filtered by the camera, but also mediated by sound. And in Italy, since it was impossible to record and synchronize direct sound, the composer gained a striking role as the main reference for the soundtrack.</p>
<p>In this paper I will focus on the Egisto Macchi’s output, a leading figure of the renewal of Italian music in the Nuova Consonanza group. He worked with significant filmmakers scoring hundreds of non-fiction films during the 1960s. Combining archival sources with historiographical and theoretical discourses of musicology and film studies, my paper calls for a reconsideration of Macchi’s documentary film music as an Italian alternative to musical modernism through the historical and political lens of cinema. By eschewing stylistic elements already widely encoded in feature films, these documentaries reveal alternative musical constants, with room for avant-garde experiments, defining a renewed artificial soundscape. Macchi’s scores systematically shun tonal system and widely encoded musical styles in an attempt to investigate the most striking and hidden characters of the reality observed by the camera. Thus, musical experimentation becomes the closest way to establish a dialogue with “reality,” allowing the spectator to engage with the subject matter afresh, in order to obtain an effect of inner truth and authenticity.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Whirling Around Mexico”: Mabel Dodge Luhan and Carlos Chávez</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christina Taylor Gibson (Catholic University of America)</p>

<p>In 1930, ten years after the Revolution (c. 1910–20), Mexico had a palpable reformist energy, despite continued political fragmentation and occasional military conflict. Mexico City’s artistic community was re-imagining a mexicanidad that privileged pre-conquest and native culture in a simultaneous effort to reject colonial hierarchies and embrace a new national identity. Streams of U.S. “pilgrims,” many part of the intellectual elite, made their way to Mexico, resulting in a transnational exchange called the “Mexico Vogue.” Like many of her fellow pilgrims, patroness Mabel Dodge Luhan visited Mexico in 1930 because she hoped to find an alternative to the capitalist modern life she associated with New York City. Her unpublished account of the trip, “Whirling Around Mexico,” provides an unusually detailed account of the personal connections required to navigate Vogue-era Mexico.</p>
<p>Carlos Chávez is as central to “Whirling Around Mexico” as he was to Mexican cultural life. By 1930, he was director of the Orquesta Sinfónica de México and head of the National Conservatory. From these positions of power, he became the primary voice of Mexican musical identity, associating it with cosmopolitan avant-gardism. Yet in the early U.S. press about his music, the national and Pan-American attributes of the work were emphasized above the modern aesthetic, and this became a theme in writings about Chávez and his music. The interactions between Mabel Dodge and Chávez recorded in her memoir revolve around a planned journey to observe and record the Huichol Indians’ peyote rituals. Both equated these rituals with the primitive, but their histories imbued that concept with different meanings. As a patroness operating in a system that privileged the single creator narrative, Mabel Dodge held hidden and often unacknowledged power—power that Chávez both recognized and subverted. By recasting his interactions with Mabel Dodge as part of network building, this paper explores the implicitly collaborative nature of art and, using a post-colonial lens, revisits the significance of primitivism and the space it provided for misunderstandings that appeared mutually beneficial but were ultimately limiting.</p>
