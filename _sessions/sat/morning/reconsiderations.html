<p class="abs-title">Reconceptualizing the <i>Lydian Chromatic Concept</i>: George
  Russell as Historical Theorist</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael McClimon (Furman University)</p>

<p>It is difficult to overstate the influence of George Russell’s <i>Lydian Chromatic Concept</i> on jazz pedagogy; he has been called the first jazz theorist, and the book has been praised as “the foremost theoretical contribution” of its time. And yet, the <i>Concept</i> has been largely ignored in recent music-theoretical scholarship on jazz. This paper considers why, by examining Russell and the <i>Concept</i> from a historical perspective.</p>
<p>Russell’s work in the <i>Concept</i> can be divided into two components: chord-scale equivalence and Lydian generation. The former has taken a strong hold in teaching improvisation; the idea that a scale can stand in for a chord symbol was groundbreaking, and seems so obvious in retrospect that many authors today do not even credit Russell with the idea. This equivalence grows out of the more fundamental theory (indeed, the Concept itself) that the Lydian mode is the principal organizing force of all tonal music. This idea is more controversial and has not taken hold in the same way. But of course, theorists are used to adopting worthwhile theoretical ideas from authors without assuming their entire worldview.</p>
<p>By reconsidering Russell historically, we can begin to understand why parts of his idiosyncratic theory have flourished while others seem to have fallen by the wayside. The paper begins by briefly outlining Russell’s contributions, tracing their adoption, and then considers what we might gain by reincorporating some of his original intention of the <i>Concept</i> into modern scholarship.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Constructionist and Interpretative Claims on Polytonality:
  Reframing the Theorizing Activity on Twentieth-Century Multi-Layered
  Harmony </p>

<p>Twentieth-century <i>polytonality</i> is one of the most “under-theorized” as well as contested labels for a compositional practice, attributed to significant passages or complete movements in the music of Bartók, Stravinsky, Milhaud, Ravel, Britten, among many others. Despite recent investigations into the global pitch structure of polytonal compositions, the reception of the contested label reflects the tension between the <i>constructionist</i> aspects of the style, in which composers deliberately combine distinct layers resonant with tonality, and perceptual and <i>interpretative</i> claims, in which listeners-as-analysts resist and argue for perceptual and logical limitations of a musical conception that suggests split and concurrent tonal systems or centers. The larger significance of such contention, however, reveals the serious challenge polytonality posed to a much-valued repertoire: to invite distinct conceptual entities into the composition, whose diverging systemic forces undermined the coherence and completeness of “masterworks.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the paper approaches polytonality by revisiting some of the theorizing activity on the subject in the 1920s to 40s by composers such as Koechlin, Milhaud, Casella and Bartók, which has subsequently been either dismissed or appropriated by the post-Schenkerian and set-theoretical approaches developed in the second part of the century. It is argued that notions of polytonality in the 1920s draw from a number of compositional phenomena, which actively explored new compositional arrangements and listening strategies. The paper inventories early accounts of polytonal practice into five key components, examines examples discussed by the above authors, and argues that polytonality casts a much wider net on compositional practice than traditionally granted, which could then be applicable to works of composers such as Lutoslawski and Ligeti.</p>
