<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>In 1804 Consul Bonaparte became Emperor Napoleon. The moment would have important consequences for music history, featuring endlessly in accounts of Beethoven’s <em>Eroica</em> Symphony. Yet musicologists have been less ready to write about French music composed during the First Empire (1804–14): works from this period—in particular state-censored theatrical ones—have often been dismissed as propaganda spectacle, peripheral to mainstream nineteenth-century aesthetic developments. However, recent studies of music under authoritarian regimes have productively exploited the multiple tensions between governmental control and artistic creativity, thus finding new meanings in “official” artistic objects.</p>
<p>This session explores these issues by looking at a range of responses to Napoleon’s cultural politics. The Opéra—as Paris’s most prestigious theater—was central to the regime’s theatrical propaganda, and spectacular events there have often been interpreted as mere political display. Yet, as the first paper will show, such productions owe as much to an aesthetic commitment to the unification of the different arts—as in Le Sueur’s <em>Ossian</em>—which originated in the new practices instigated under the revolution. The legacy of the revolution can also be seen in reactions to Napoleon’s reorganization of the theaters in 1806–7. After the freedom of the revolutionary period, this top-down regulation of genres and institutions did not go unchallenged; the second paper considers the phenomenon of “genre-consciousness” in the production and reception of musico-theatrical works from these years, including a spate of pieces in which genres were personified on stage. The session thus reinserts Napoleonic theater into music history, both by pursuing continuities with revolutionary practices and ideals, and by revealing it to be a site of experimentation and meta-theatrical reflection. By showing the way in which Napoleon’s cultural prescriptions were obeyed, negotiated, and at times ignored, the session also contributes to broader considerations of the relationship between creative practice and political power.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Dreaming “Opéra de Luxe”: Spectacle in Le Sueur’s <em>Ossian ou les Bardes</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Annelies Andries (Yale University)</p>

<p>On 10 July 1804 an enormous three-tiered aerial palace appeared at the Paris Opéra, accompanied by the ethereal sound of eight harps, and by 111 singers and dancers lamenting Ossian’s fate. Critics raved about this dream scene in Le Sueur’s <em>Ossian ou les Bardes</em>, calling it the most astounding spectacle ever staged at the Opéra.</p>
<p><em>Ossian</em>’s reliance on the combined effect of music, dance, costumes, and stage sets, and its evocation of an ancient mythological universe, have traditionally been linked to its function as Napoleonic propaganda, while Le Sueur’s operatic aesthetics have been treated as a precursor of Wagner’s theories of the <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>. In contrast, this paper interprets the “total spectacle” in <em>Ossian</em> as a product of the artistic agenda of the Opéra’s directors. I demonstrate that staging the rich visual and musical world of Macpherson’s Ossianic poems (1760–65)— the principal source of <em>Ossian</em>—provided the ideal opportunity to reassert the Opéra’s prestige and its artistic prowess, which had been in decline since 1789. An analysis of <em>Ossian</em>’s creation history and the institution’s administrative documents reveals that consecutive revisions of Le Sueur’s opera increasingly capitalized on the Opéra’s reputation for visual and musical luxury and its ambition to be a center for the fine arts. <em>Ossian</em> furthermore profited from the institution’s aspiration to integrate better the operatic arts, a process influenced by the importance of immersive theatrical experiences to post-revolutionary conceptions of theatrical illusion and catharsis, and reflected in reorganizations around 1800 that encouraged closer collaboration between its various creators.</p>
<p><em>Ossian</em>’s dream scene most fully realized the Opéra’s new ambitions. Although building on a long history of spectacular French operatic dream scenes, its innovative union of the institution’s vast resources overwhelmed audiences and created demand for scenes with ever more impressive musical and stage effects, leading directly to the extravagant tableaux of <em>grand opéra</em>. By examining the artistic and institutional prompts behind these spectacular scenes, my paper seeks to unearth the larger aesthetic developments in which Napoleonic opera participated and dethrone the imperial propaganda machine as the principal agent in its creation.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Genre Consciousness” in the Napoleonic Theater</p>
<p class="abs-author">Katherine Hambridge (Durham University)</p>


<p>In Martainville’s <em>Le Mariage du mélodrame et de la gaîté</em> (1808), a personification of the institution of the Théâtre de la Gaîté uses vaudeville techniques and melodies from <em>opéras-comiques</em> to debate the qualities of her competing generic suitors “le petit vaudeville” and “le mélodrame,” along with the admission of dance, song, pantomime, mute characters, laughter, and battle scenes to her court. This knowing, meta-theatrical entertainment was one of several staged responses to recent changes in the theatrical economy: in 1806–7, after fifteen years of proliferating institutions and genres, Napoleon re-introduced strict theatrical regulations, assigning particular genres to particular venues, and reasserting genre divisions on the basis of subject matter and the role and proportion of spoken word, music, and dance.</p>
<p>In histories of genre theory, the years around 1800 are often seen as the birth of a modern, anti-generic attitude, courtesy of—among others—the Schlegel brothers and their insistence that each work is “a genre unto itself.” This (German) Romanticization of genre has infiltrated musicology with lasting effect, as Senici (2014) has recently shown. At the same time, genre as an heuristic tool of classification, communication, and analysis has remained in use. Even when applied with sophistication, as in Kallberg’s consideration (1996) of genre as a Jaussian “horizon of expectations,” there have been few attempts to examine the historical and geographical specificity of genre as a category of experience.</p>
<p>In this paper I seek to problematize both these positions by examining an alternative moment of generic transformation. Using surviving administrative documents, my paper begins by reconstructing the political and financial motivations for Napoleon’s 1806–7 retrenchment, and the bureaucratic process of defining genre characteristics. I then explore how, and to what extent, genre categories shaped the use and reception of music as a dramatic medium. <em>Le Mariage</em>, for example, reveals awareness both of the artificiality of generic and institutional boundaries, and of the generic associations attached to certain musical vocabularies, forms, and effects. The examination of such “genre consciousness” among institutional committees, creators, and audiences opens up new ways of engaging with established narratives of nineteenth-century generic experimentation.</p>
