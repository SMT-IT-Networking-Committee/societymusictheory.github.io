<p>How do musicians get out of a jam? Concluding these lengthy, unstructured sections requires band members to choose to reunite and resolve their improvisations in the same moment. When jazz-fusion bands like The Grateful Dead and Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood arrive at this juncture, they seem to accomplish the impossible: After thirty minutes of improvising with little more than a shared pulse and mode, players suddenly synchronize. Phrase groupings align, and the band unites in an elided cadence. They do this using neither hand signals nor rehearsed instructions, and without ever missing a beat.</p>
<p>Band members are able to improvise such complex changes collectively because they are communicating with one another using musical cues. By analyzing transcriptions of live performances by a variety of jazz, funk, and jazz-rock bands (i.e. jam-bands), I show that there is a consistent pattern in their use of these cues. In order to initiate a collective change, bands must give two cues simultaneously. One musician introduces a salient pitch-based event, like a marked motivic repetition or an accented chromatic harmony, while another answers it with consecutive hypermetric upbeats. This opens a line of communication that enables players to share and act upon their intentions, such as resolving the jam. The musical negotiations of these bands suggest that the individual voices of bebop solos and free jazz may have grown into the collective conversations of improvisation in the mid- to late-twentieth century.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“I Know It’s Over”: Melodically Established Keys and Tonal (Non-)Closure in Contemporary Popular Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jeremy Smith (University of Minnesota)</p>

<p>Recent research on popular music has shown that it often contains a “melodic-harmonic divorce” (Temperley 2007). This paper shows instances of the “loop divorce” type (Nobile 2015) from recent popular songs that feature the melody clearly establishing the tonal center, while the harmony does not coordinate with <em>any</em> root position tonic harmony. Spicer’s 2009 presentation shows this phenomenon in older songs, but refers to them as having an “absent tonic,” in other words a tonic that is only implied by the given pitches. In the more recent examples shown in this paper, the tonic is only absent in its harmonic form, while it is very much present in its melodic form. The harmonic loops so recurrent in today’s “top forty” music contain three or four chords that determine the song’s diatonic pitch-collection, but not necessarily the tonal center. Often the ionian vs aeolian dichotomy is highlighted through ambiguous harmony, so the melody determines the tonality. The melodies in this paper create major tonalities, often through strong melodically-cadential patterns such as 3 2 1. Paradoxically, the closed, repetitive loops in these pieces represent what Satyendra (1997) calls “open structures” since they contain no harmonic resolution to tonic harmony and end with an unfinished quality. This paper also discusses why most songs displaying this phenomenon have harmonic loops starting on IV, and speculates as to why the technique is not used to create minor tonalities. Examples under consideration include songs by Justin Bieber (“Sorry”), Coldplay (“Fun”), and Katy Perry (“Last Friday Night”).</p>

<p class="abs-title">Long Dissonance and the Metaphors of Musical Work</p>
<p class="abs-author">Joon Park (University of Arkansas)</p>

<p>This talk reintroduces the concept of melodic-harmonic divorce (discussed by Allan Moore, David Temperley, and Drew Nobile) as a more general phenomenon, “a long dissonance,” by looking at similar instances in classical music. The concept of long dissonance is then compared to the conventional treatment of dissonances. In a conventional understanding of a musical work, a dissonance elaborates a consonance and consonances function as the building-blocks of a composition. I argue that a long dissonance does not participate in this process because what is being elaborated is not as clearly articulated as in the case of conventional dissonances. In other words, while the function of conventional dissonances is clear (as embellishments), that of long dissonances are not.</p>
<p>This paper draws on the conceptual metaphor theory to investigate the concept of function and the conventional view of musical components. I argue that when a musical note is described to be “functioning as” something, we metaphorically understand the note to be a worker in a factory. Similar to how a factory worker takes part in manufacturing a finished product, I argue that a properly functioning note takes part in creating a musical work. In this context, a long dissonance can be described as “lazy,” “estranged,” or “divorced.” This conceptual metaphor is then considered in the context of Kant’s notion of purposiveness (Zweckmässigkeit) and Heidegger’s concept of “standing-reserve” (<em>Bestand</em>).</p>

<p class="abs-title">Salience, Common Tones, and Middleground Dissonance in the Fourth Chorus of Brad Mehldau’s Improvisation on “All the Things You Are”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rich Pellegrin (University of Missouri)</p>
<p>This presentation examines the relationship between pitch stability and salience (a function of metric placement, duration, parallelism, loudness, register, etc.) in performances by Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, and Brad Mehldau, with special attention given to the usage of common tones. A Bill Evans improvisation on his composition “Bill’s Hit Tune” is first presented to illustrate how upper chord tones may form ascending middleground lines that work against their implied resolutions, temporarily privileging salience over stability. A passage of a Herbie Hancock improvisation on “Autumn Leaves” is then presented to illustrate how common tones can also privilege salience over stability by frustrating the resolving tendencies of unstable chord tones (though sometimes a repeated tone may lose its “need to resolve” (Strunk 1985)).</p>
<p>The remainder of the presentation focuses on the fourth chorus of Brad Mehldau’s improvisation on “All the Things You Are,” that which appears on his 1999 album, <em>Art of the Trio, Volume 4: Back at the Vanguard</em>. My analysis brings together elements from both the Evans and Hancock examples, demonstrating how middleground common tones which are salient but often unstable combine to form plateaus, ascending and descending lines, and a coherent large-scale structure.</p>
