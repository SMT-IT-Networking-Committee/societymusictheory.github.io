<p class="abs-title">Synchronization in the Synagogue</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rosa Abrahams (Northwestern University)</p>

<p>Congregants and leaders move in the Synagogue: they sway, bend, bow, and rock throughout the sung and spoken text. Music scholarship on body synchronization (Cox 2011; Leman &amp; Naveda 2010) and on bodies and ritual (Dissanayake 2009; Maróthy 1993) indicates that movement should be coordinated with speech or song, incorporated into some level of rhythmic hierarchy within the worshipper’s prayer. However, original ethnographic observations and interviews in North American Reform &amp; Conservative Jewish congregations reveal that metricity in embodied prayer entails more complexity than simple entrainment between body and voice or multiple worshipping bodies.</p>
<p>In this paper, I investigate bodily synchronization with unaccompanied vocal chant, integrating voice and movement analyses and positing that signature metrical movement patterns enhance and sometimes precede individual prayer experiences. To understand how meter materializes in a prayer context, I incorporate Frigyesi’s (1993) concept of “free rhythm” (distinct from metered or unmetered rhythms) into movement, suggesting that physical movements during prayer are also “free”: engaging multiple levels of rhythm, breath, and musical metricity, and expressing multiple metric streams between body and voice. Drawing from music theory, psychology, and my ethnography, I build a vocabulary for types of individual movements. Further, by examining the relationship of the individual to the group, I show that complex and seemingly spontaneous acts of personal worship are magnified across multiple worshippers, complicating conceptions of bodily synchronization to music in the synagogue, and raising questions of movement, ritual, and religious experience.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Spiritual Experience of Jonathan Harvey’s <em>Body Mandala</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Evan Campbell (McGill University)</p>

<p>Jonathan Harvey believed that “Music’s connection with spirituality can be thought of as music acting as a trigger for the spiritual experience” (Harvey 1999). Despite recent studies on Harvey’s music (Palmer 2001; Downes 2009), scholars have yet to pinpoint these spiritual “triggers” in his works. This paper identifies specific compositional techniques as triggers, linking passages from Harvey’s mesmerizing orchestral work <em>Body Mandala</em> (2006) to three kinds of spiritual experiences. I describe how these experiences are inspired by Harvey’s own Buddhist spirituality, and how they shape the formal trajectory of the work.</p>
<p>I begin with an overview of Harvey’s interviews and writings, in which he refers to three key spiritual experiences: Unity, Transcendence, and Emptiness. Harvey’s remarks provide enough detail to identify the particular musical features that shape these experiences in <em>Body Mandala</em>. I go on to describe how Unity and Transcendence interact to generate a formal push toward a climactic Emptiness section. This climax presents the main thematic material of the work in a formless, abstract state, which I interpret as Harvey’s attempt to evoke Emptiness—a core tenet of his Mahayana Buddhist faith. This climactic section, and <em>Body Mandala</em> as a whole, is meant to rise above the sonic and touch the listener’s spirit. Whether Harvey achieves this lofty goal depends on the listener, but there can be little doubt that his spirituality lies at the heart of the work.</p>
