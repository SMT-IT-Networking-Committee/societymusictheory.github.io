<p class="abs-title">A “most authentic American folk music”: Nostalgia and Colonialism in the Soundtrack of <em>The Man in the High Castle</em></p>

<p>Svetlana Boym writes that nostalgia is not always “directed toward the past” but rather “sideways” (2001), an apt description of Philip K. Dick’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> (1962). Whereas the novel did gaze sideways at a futuristic contemporary parallel universe, the 2015 Amazon series looks backward at an alternate 1962 that more closely resembles the 1950s. The novel presents a world in which the Axis powers won World War II and the Nazis have eradicated black culture; rock ’n’ roll never happened, and jazz belongs to an almost forgotten past now coveted by Japanese collectors fascinated with artifacts endowed with the “historicity” of the former USA. While the Nazis surpass their technology, colonizing Mars and accomplishing intercontinental travel via rockets, the Japanese look backward to an America that no longer exists, with its Mickey Mouse watches, Civil War-era pistols, and Jean Harlow posters. This world, Cassie Carter argues, parodies the American colonization of nonwestern peoples by showing America colonized by a caricature of itself (1995). The Amazon show, however, translates the novel’s representation of imperialism from the context of present day anxieties about race, nostalgia, and post-colonialism, portraying a past alternate reality rather than an ominous parable of a contemporary Cold War. Drawing on the work of Boym, Caryl Flinn (1992), and Richard Middleton (2007), this paper explores how the show’s diegetic musical choices situate an audience looking backward at a fictional past that itself is steeped in nostalgia for a problematic “white” history stripped of African-American musical and cultural influence. This nostalgia is made ambiguous, however, with the inclusion of songs coded alternately “white” and “black” as the audience attempts to uncover the true motivations and agendas of the show’s characters. From its portrayal of an undercover Nazi agent listening to Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” to the surprising appearance of Chubby Checker’s “The Twist” in the season finale, the show undermines Dick’s deconstruction of American imperialism, questioning what can be considered “authentic” American culture and drawing disturbing parallels between the fictional subjugation of white Americans and the actual discrimination against African Americans.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Hooked to the Silver Screen”: David Bowie’s <em>Hunger City</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Katherine Reed (Utah Valley University)</p>

<p>Following his international success as the aliens Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, David Bowie turned his attention to another large-scale project: adapting George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>. It has long been known that Bowie originally conceived of this <em>1984</em> project as a stage musical. When that plan failed, the songs became 1974’s <em>Diamond Dogs</em>, retaining Orwellian overtones that carried into the stage design for the album’s tour. This elaborate stage show was assumed to be the end of Bowie’s <em>1984</em>, as he quickly moved on to record <em>Young Americans</em>. Recently, though, storyboards and script notes have come to light showing the proposed next stage of the <em>1984</em> project: an unrealized film titled <em>Hunger City</em>. What would David Bowie’s cinematic vision have looked like, and how might we view his oeuvre differently in light of the project?</p>
<p>Drawing on these new archival materials, this paper examines the development of Bowie’s dystopian vision as it evolved from musical to album and, finally, to a planned film. Piecing together <em>Hunger City</em>’s plot, I first analyze <em>Diamond Dogs</em> through the conventions of the stage musical, concentrating especially on the <em>Diamond Dogs</em> touring show and its structure. I examine the influence of German Expressionist visual language in the stage design and storyboards, reading <em>Hunger City</em> as deeply rooted in the history and art of Weimar Germany and the Nazi regime that followed, excising many of <em>1984</em>’s original Stalinist references. The vision and artistic influences evident in <em>Hunger City</em> give insight into Bowie as a musician, visual artist, and actor in the 1970s, informing new readings of his other, more controversial works.</p>
