<p class="abs-title">Mendacious Technology</p>
<p class="abs-author">Emily Dolan (Harvard University)</p>

<p>In 1817, François Chanot—son of violin maker Joseph Chanot—filed a patent for a new and improved violin. His instrument was tested by the Académies des sciences and des beaux-arts, where the joint committee declared that his instrument “was not inferior” to the Stradivarius and Guarnerius violins to which it was compared. Like many proposed improvements to the violin of the period, Chanot’s design was short-lived. It also marked the first of many tests in which old and new violins were pitted against each other in formal assessments. Overwhelmingly, new violins have won out over old ones. Nevertheless, the history of the violin has seemingly been one of steadfast stability and stark resistance to any technological change. In mid-nineteenth-century narratives of technological progress, the violin was routinely praised as both already perfect and the standard to which other instruments—winds, keyboards, and even lower strings—could aspire. The language of consummate perfection endures today (the current Grove entry on the instrument praises the violin as “one of the most perfect instruments acoustically.”) Celebratory writing clings to the violin with more tenacity than it does to the music performed using the instrument: musicologists have Scott Burnham’s Beethoven Hero, but organologists have no Stradivarius Hero.</p>
<p>This paper considers the formation of the rhetoric of perfection that surrounds the violin as well as the tenacious belief in the superiority of old violins. In particular, I am interested in the surprising ways in which the status and value of old violins has been driven by technological innovation. Focusing on early nineteenth-century violin making, I trace the development of the violin as a piece of mendacious technology: an instrument that lies about its own historicity. This is not to condemn the instrument or its makers. Rather, mendacious technology performs a productive, even essential, role within musical history. The violin itself has undergone many significant—though underplayed—technological alterations; but what has endured is the very notion that the instrument has endured. The musical canon—and meaningful access to it—depends upon this careful obfuscating of technological history.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Grids and Filters: Chopinian Methods of (Dis)closure</p>
<p class="abs-author">Roger Moseley (Cornell University)</p>

<p>In 1852, the exiled German composer, author, and pedagogue Johanna Kinkel heard Chopin’s piano music to herald the “emancipation of quarter tones” by “rattling the gate” that simultaneously disclosed and barred “Nature’s eternal sounds.” Condemned to “slink reluctantly by way of semitones,” Chopin’s melodies “grope for finer spiritual nuances than current intentions can realize.” Kinkel’s frustration was framed as both symptom and diagnosis of the piano’s crude partitioning of frequency. For others, however, the ensoulment of the piano was made audible by the very limitations of the digital interface that it purported to transcend. In 1926, Adolf Weissmann claimed that it was at Chopin’s bidding that “the machine was made eloquent by a unique personality . . . For the first time, the keyed machinery was redeemed.” Weissmann also noted that “the obstacles [the piano] put into the way of the fingers’ capacity to grip and the hand’s span” served only to intensify “the performer’s ambition to inspirit this machine.” Like the narrow voids at the intersections of paving stones, the cracks between the piano’s keys present ludomusical obstacles, successful navigation of which entails both acknowledgment and circumvention from composer and performer alike.</p>
<p>From his day to ours, musical images of Chopin at the keyboard have consistently mediated Romantic fantasies that at once admit and deny the mechanisms that bring them to spiritual life. Drawing on work by James Q. Davies and Bernhard Siegert, among others, this paper approaches the interfaces through which Chopin’s music was filtered in terms of their compliance and intransigence. The digital transmission of Chopinian signals via the keyboard’s grid has been liable to introduce technical artifacts that are best elucidated via concepts and terminology associated with computer graphics. Moving across time as well as the discursive registers of pedagogy, performance, media theory, and cultural techniques, I pursue the notion that rather than constituting a transparent means by which Chopin and those who followed in his fingerprints could impose their musical will, the keyboard’s pliability could engender mindless automatism. Conversely, the creative spirit could be spurred rather than hindered by mechanical resistance and the concomitant implication of communicative distortion.</p>
