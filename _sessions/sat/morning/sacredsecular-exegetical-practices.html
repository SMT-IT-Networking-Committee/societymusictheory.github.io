<p class="abs-title">“A Literary . . . or Musical Gift”: Erasmus Rotenbucher’s Bergkreyen as a Primer for Protestant Lay Exegesis</p>
<p class="abs-author">Megan Eagen (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)</p>

<p>Erasmus Rotenbucher published his <em>Bergkreyen</em> (mountain dances), a collection of twenty-eight German and ten French two-voice songs in 1551. The book features the output of several contemporary Protestant-leaning artists, including Thomas Stoltzer, Joachim Heller, and Paul Rebhun. Though the title links these works to a non-erudite folk tradition, the German songs are almost entirely spiritual, and each song is headed with a Latin poetic inscription. Sources for these inscriptions range from the biblical psalms, to Ovid’s <em>Fasti</em>, to Helius Eobanus Hessus’s <em>Psalterium Davidis</em>. In his dedication, Rotenbucher describes the <em>Bergkreyen</em> as “a literary (as I should call it) or musical gift,” asserting its textual and musical value. Indeed, I argue that there is a dialogue among the Latin and German texts and the music, with each contributing material for lay interpretation and conversation.</p>
<p>Latin inscriptions assigning feasts or explaining canonic devices are not uncommon for this period, yet that is not the function of Rotenbucher’s texts. Having consulted more than eighty motet books, bicinia, and tricinia published 1540–80, I find that Rotenbucher’s use of poetic excerpts proves to be unique. Rotenbucher, a school provost, sought to create a primer on pious Protestant living. This collection would have been appropriate for students, as it includes several high-voice duets, and Rotenbucher emphasizes its moral and educational value in his preface. Six compositions, drawn from Paul Rebhun’s <em>Susanna</em> (1535) appear in the volume, removed from their original context and paired with both sacred and secular Latin poetry. The dynamics of the relationships among texts, paratexts, and music that are brought together around these works require an exegetical approach. Pieces that were transplanted from a play about a woman’s piety transform into instructional tools in the context of the <em>Bergkreyen</em>. My analysis of the new meaning of Rebhun’s music in the context of Rotenbucher’s collection builds on David Crook’s recent study on exegetical motets, Paul F. Casey’s literary-focused examination of Rebhun’s choruses, and Franz Krautwurst’s work on Rotenbucher. Ultimately, this paper situates the <em>Bergkreyen</em> alongside other forms of Protestant multimedia exegesis, such as emblems and broadsheets, bringing music into a current literary conversation about these materials.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Woman at the Well: Divine and Earth(l)y Love in Orlando di Lasso’s Parody Masses</p>
<p class="abs-author">Barbara Eichner (Oxford Brookes University)</p>

<p>In recent years the unabashed eroticism of early modern music has received increased scholarly attention (e.g. Blackburn &amp; Stras, 2015). From the expression of bodily desires in madrigal and chanson, the focus has broadened to include the interrelationship of sensuality and spirituality in early modern sacred music (e.g. Rothenberg 2011), particularly motets written and sung in Italian nunneries (e.g. Kendrick 1996, Macy 2011). The presence of an amorous subtext in the parody mass, however, continues to puzzle modern-day performers and listeners. While Bloxam (2004) has suggested a courtly environment as the primary nurturing ground for the cultivation of the early chanson mass, the persistence of the genre into the sixteenth century, beyond the alleged clampdown on “wanton and impure” music in the wake of the Council of Trent (Crook, unpublished), still demands an explanation.</p>
<p>Orlando di Lasso’s parody masses, written for the zealously Catholic court of Munich, are notorious for flouting the boundaries of sacred and secular. Several chanson models are of such an explicit nature that the standard explanatory strategies—e.g. a projection of erotic desire onto the Virgin Mary—seem hardly sufficient. This paper will focus on one such example, the <em>Missa Entre vous filles</em>, and propose a reading that leaves intact the ribald humour of the original but brings it into dialogue with sixteenth-century theology and cultures of spirituality. Specifically, I will argue that this mass was written as a companion piece to the <em>Missa Veni in hortum meum</em>, based on a Song of Songs motet, as demonstrated by the transmission history of both pieces. A close reading of the textual and musical relationship between models and masses reveals that the four pieces form part of an elaborate conversation about sin, redemption, eroticism, and the Eucharist that is fully congruent with counter-Reformation sensibilities but could only have occurred to an artist as aware of linguistic nuances and the power of allusion as Orlando di Lasso. Thus this paper offers a more nuanced model for understanding the allegorical intertextuality of one of the core genres of Renaissance music, which will have wider implications for conceptualizing the sacred and the secular in early modern culture.</p>


<p class="abs-title">“Our Enemies Are Gathered Together”: The Politics of Motets in the Newberry Partbooks</p>
<p class="abs-author">Mary Ellen Ryan (Indiana University)</p>

<p>In the early sixteenth century, motets could become political tools. This assertion is illustrated by the exquisitely decorated Newberry Partbooks (Chicago, Newberry Library, Case MS.VM 1578.M91/ Sutton Coldfield, Oscott College, Old Library, MS Case B No. 4), given to King Henry VIII to secure his support for the Florentine Republic. Other manuscripts—such as those produced in the Alamire workshop—served diplomatic purposes, yet the pressing conditions surrounding its creation and the consistency of its political orientation set apart the Newberry source. As I maintain, motets in this collection projected a unified message, one of Florentine reliance upon divine and earthly aid to protect the city from challenges posed to its social order. This manuscript therefore represents a key example of the commingling between spirituality and politics during a calamitous period.</p>
<p>The Newberry Partbooks, comprised of thirty motets and thirty madrigals, were compiled around 1528 when central Italy experienced a series of devastating crises. Following the ousting of the Medici family from the city, Florence successfully reinstalled its republic in 1527, only to face an encroaching Imperial army and a yearlong siege beginning in 1529. During this uncertain period, the government likely sent the manuscript to the English monarch to enlist his financial and military support, as H. Colin Slim has argued. Though music historians such as Slim, Iain Fenlon, and Don Harrán have remarked on the political content of this manuscript, they have viewed the music as evidence of composers’ political affiliations (Verdelot’s republican leanings as one example) or have focused on the cultural resonances of selected pieces. Offering a new approach, I examine the motets’ thematic continuity constructed over the course of the manuscript. I also argue that the civic government’s requests for assistance are voiced in the opening motet, a prayer for peace, and continue to be framed musically and textually in varying ways in the compositions that follow<em>.</em> Through the organization, presentation, and performance of this collection, Florence’s republic fashioned a civic narrative of prayer and petition in order to withstand political turmoil.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Anti-Inquisition Propaganda at the Outbreak of the Dutch Revolt: Noé Faignient’s <em>Chansons, madrigales et motetz</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Sienna Wood (University of Colorado at Boulder)</p>

<p>The Dutch Revolt was launched in 1568, the same year that Antwerp composer Noé Faignient printed his two-volume debut of polyphonic music, <em>Chansons, madrigales et motetz</em>. Many scholars examining the political culture surrounding the Dutch Revolt have noted the important role played by the arts as sites for the negotiation and reinforcement of the collective identity necessary for a successful uprising against the Spanish. Monophonic songs of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—including “Beggar’s Ballads” and the Orangist “Wilhelmus” (now the national anthem of the Netherlands)—have been examined as political speech, but the political dimensions of contemporaneous polyphonic music have not yet been thoroughly considered. In this presentation I will show that a close reading of Faignient’s polyphonic song collection reveals propaganda messages against the Spanish government and, more particularly, the state-sanctioned Inquisition.</p>
<p>The Dutch Revolt is often characterized as one in a long series of Protestant uprisings against Catholic sovereigns in the sixteenth century, but in the early stages of the rebellion Protestants and Catholics of the Low Countries were united against a common enemy: the Inquisition. This is revealed in rebel propaganda that downplays religious divisions, instead condemning the activities of the Inquisition as tyrannical violations of “all ancient privileges, liberties, and immunities” due to all people of the Low Countries regardless of religious alignment. This ideology created common ground for Catholics and Protestants, uniting them against a common enemy and justifying armed rebellion against the Spanish rulers who established and supported the centralized Inquisition.</p>
<p>The political agenda underlying Faignient’s debut is revealed by 1) a posture of religious non-alignment that parallels early rebel propaganda, 2) the presence of liedekens (Dutch-texted pieces) that reveal feelings of nationalism and patriotism, and 3) anti-tyranny textual themes and allusions to political events and figures of the time including Margaret of Parma and the Duke of Alva. This paper will analyze Faignient’s <em>Chansons, madrigales et motetz</em> as pro-rebellion propaganda parallel to contemporaneous political writing justifying the Dutch Revolt as resistance to the tyrannical practices of the Spanish government and its Inquisition.</p>
