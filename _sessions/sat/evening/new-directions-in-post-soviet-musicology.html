<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>More than two decades beyond the Cold War many western scholars still see Russia through a Soviet lens—one which increasingly distorts the realities of Russian culture. Old analytic paradigms no longer seem applicable, and many were suspect to begin with, inflected as they were by the narrow perspectives of the Cold War. At the same time, there is a tendency among Russian scholars to neglect what western scholars write on matters relating to Russia. Instead of an exchange of perspectives, we have two different traditions of scholarship and two different canons that, at best, run in parallel.</p>
<p>This panel brings together scholars from Russia and the West for interdisciplinary exchange on the challenges and promise of crossing this cultural divide. Its aim, in part, is to introduce the work that has been done by Russian musicologists in the aftermath of the Soviet era to scholars in North America. Participants will consider both the Russian and the western canons of Russian musicology and their respective lacunae, as well as offer ideas that might stimulate productive dialogue between scholars adopting these approaches. Attention will also be devoted to fundamental differences between the interpretive frameworks that have shaped the discipline of Russian musicology in the West and in Russia.</p>
<p>The panelists include acknowledged experts in the field as well as some of the most promising younger scholars from Russia and from the West. The session features five presentations, one response, and moderated discussion periods. A roundtable discussion with questions from the floor will follow.</p>
