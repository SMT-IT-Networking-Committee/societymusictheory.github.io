<p>For most music scholars at every phase of their careers, attention to and
success in “The Job Market” is posited as the principal if not the only path to
professional, personal, and even spiritual success. At the same time, the
increasing prevalence of adjunct and contingent academic positions and the
simultaneous decline of well-compensated and stable tenured positions have only
increased the competition and anxiety surrounding academic employment more
broadly. </p>

<p>This panel offers perspectives and advice on identifying and seeking jobs in
which musicological expertise can be put to use outside of full-time academic
teaching. By sharing their perspectives and experiences in various professional
contexts, the panelists hope to show how “The Job Market” in fact represents
only a small subset of the ways in which one can live and work as a
musicologist. Perhaps not surprisingly, these sorts of jobs afford
opportunities to pursue what has been termed “public musicology” in quite
tangible and fulfilling ways. These contributions seek to dismantle the
dichotomous thinking by which every other job besides academic employment is
categorized in the problematic category of “alt-ac.”</p>

<p>Each of the panelists will speak for ten minutes about their professional
journey since completing their doctoral studies and then briefly respond to one
another. The remaining time will be given over to comments, questions, and
discussion among all in attendance. In conclusion, each panelist will offer
practical tips for preparing for jobs besides tenure-track academic teaching
and research.</p>
