<p>While new Formenlehre, initiated by William Caplin, James Hepokoski, and
Warren Darcy in the late 1990s, revitalized studies on sonata form and related
forms, the genesis of musical forms, and especially of forms that have been
considered as characteristic of the Viennese classical style, has remained an
understudied field in recent music history and theory. This has been due to at
least three intertwined problems: first, long-term developments are principally
difficult to observe because they require the analysis of a large number of
pieces if the researcher does not want to rely on few subjectively selected
paradigmatic examples. Second, even if they are as disciplined as possible,
researchers have tended to unconsciously alter their analytical criteria and
measures from one work to another, thus obtaining results that are manifold and
detailed, yet ultimately incomparable. Third, the perspective with which
researchers have examined the history of specific forms, first and foremost the
sonata form, has been strongly shaped by their personal concept of the form
whose genesis they wanted to reconstruct. Thus, they may have inappropriately
described earlier forms as deviations and neglected the actual principles that
governed the shaping of those prior forms. To put it bluntly, they put the cart
before the horse. </p>

<p>This session will discuss to what degree big-data studies and
computer-assisted analysis can counteract these problems—and create new ones.
It will demonstrate how new perspectives on form that emerge in the course of
designing software and statistical evaluation change the understanding of
“form” and its concept. The four researchers on the panel will bring in the
following expertise: Yoel Greenberg will present a systems-theory oriented
approach to formal evolution. Drawing on a statistical study on types of
thematic restatement in instrumental works, he will explain
mid-eighteenth-century formal “stereotypes” (Rosen), or “low level defaults”
(Hepokoski and Darcy) as responding to tensions and rivalries between
conflicting common practices. Beate Kutschke will throw light on the diffusion
(and confusion) in the context of established definitions of small forms,
unproblematic in manually performed analyses, but crucial in computer-assisted
analysis. She will particularly focus on—usually neglected—constituents of
musical form in pre-classical music: “repetition” and “similarity/identity.”
Mathieu Giraud works on computational analysis of simple sonata forms in
classical string quartets. He will present how algorithms may detect structural
elements in the sonata form, such as the medial caesura, and how the use of
numeric tools can help to bridge the gap between human, semi-automated or
automated analyses in either research or education. David Huron will present
some of the computational opportunities afforded by the new era of Big Data in
music. He will describe some existing tools for automated form analysis, and
also outline some of the many pitfalls associated with computational and
statistical methods in the study of music.</p>

<p>The discussion will be open to the floor immediately after the four
statements.</p>
