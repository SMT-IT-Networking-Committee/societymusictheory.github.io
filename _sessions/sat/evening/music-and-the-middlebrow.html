<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>In recent years, the academy has seen an explosion of interest in the concept of the middlebrow—a term that originated in the interwar period to describe a cultural milieu that sought to broaden access to high culture, even while preserving its elite status. With film and literary studies leading the way, scholars have used the middlebrow to unpack a range of pedagogic initiatives, criticism, marketing practices, technological developments and compositional styles, which combined to complicate the ever fraught opposition between high and low culture. However, with the exception of a handful of recent publications (Chowrimootoo, 2011, 2012; Tunbridge, 2013), musicology has yet to benefit from a sustained engagement with the concept.</p>
<p>This ninety-minute panel redresses this, deepening our understanding of musical practices and products that might usefully be understood as middlebrow. It includes an introduction sketching the state of middlebrow research, four tenminute papers and a formal response.</p>
<p>Peter Franklin begins by considering the middlebrow concert experience and its associated modes of listening, as imagined by mass-entertainment cinema. Taking Hollywood’s <em>Now, Voyager</em> (1942) as a case study, he considers how the film presents Tchaikovsky’s <em>Pathétique</em> as heard but not listened to (or listened to in an “unmusical” way).</p>
<p>Christopher Chowrimootoo explores this auditory culture further, addressing the intersection between listening, criticism, and composition in 1930s America. Focusing on Copland’s activities as composer and critic, he suggests that the period’s penchant for all-inclusive style histories, “stylistic listening,” and Copland’s own eclectic musical palette had common roots in the middlebrow impulse to expand the public’s horizons while “reducing” music history to a manageable set of styles.</p>
<p>The question of music appreciation is continued by Kate Guthrie, who considers how the development of a musical avant-garde in 1950s Britain precipitated a new discourse around music education in schools. Using Maxwell Davies’s <em>O Magnum Mysterium</em>, she explores how educators mobilized the composition and performance of modern music as vehicles for appreciation.</p>
<p>If Davies’s initiative was characterized by optimism, the final paper presents a less utopian middlebrow imaginary. Heather Wiebe looks at how musical taste indexes failed promises of social mobility in the 1977 play <em>Abigail’s Party</em>. Placing it in dialogue with Clement Greenberg’s notion of kitsch, she explores the middlebrow as an object of both contempt and melancholy, while suggesting how music exerts a force in the play that complicates its apparent debasement.</p>
<p>This session provides a springboard for discussing the interaction between the institutions, ideologies, and compositional styles implicated in the middlebrow. In the process, we hope to interrogate how the social and aesthetic dimensions of musical culture evolve in dialogue with each other—a question that the middlebrow is uniquely placed to address on account of its paradoxical commitments both to the ideal of art as transcending the social and political spheres, and to art’s potential to transform society.</p>
