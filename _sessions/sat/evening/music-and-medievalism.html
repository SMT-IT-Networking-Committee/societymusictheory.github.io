<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Recent decades have seen a remarkable growth of interest in the intersection of music and medievalism. Scholars have investigated histories of the early music movement, nineteenth-century iterations of medievalism, and the use of medieval (or medievalist) music in popular genres. In 2014 <em>Grove Music Online</em> added a new article on “medievalism,” in which Annette Kreutziger-Herr identifies four principal categories of medievalism in music: “creative” (the production of new works of art); “reproductive” (the reconstruction of medieval works); “scientific” (the study of the medieval using methodologies considered authentic); and “ideological” (the exploitation of the Middle Ages for political or ideological gain). As Kreutziger-Herr acknowledges, these categories are frequently inseparable. Indeed, all forms of medievalism, even—or perhaps especially—the scientific, are to some extent embedded in ideology. The panel will use these four categories as a point of departure for the development of new critical approaches to the study of music and medievalism.</p>
<p>Michael Richardson will examine the recreation of <em>Minnesang</em> in Wagner’s <em>Tannhäuser</em> and the “chivalric” style in <em>Lohengrin</em>. In keeping with elements of Romantic medievalism, these works idealize the Middle Ages as the period of piety, chivalry, nature, and courtly love. Lacking scientific information, composers developed semiotic musical codes to evoke a distinctive medievalist aura. Stephen Meyer will examine the afterlife of this Romantic medievalism through a study of John Boorman’s 1981 film <em>Excalibur</em>. With a score compiled primarily from Wagnerian excerpts, Boorman’s film exemplifies a doubled form of this “creative” medievalism, one that has been deeply influential for fantasy film.</p>
<p>Exploring the overlap between “scientific” and “creative” medievalism, Jennifer Bain considers <em>Vision</em>, Margarethe von Trotta’s biopic about Hildegard of Bingen. Von Trotta uses general, superficial medieval icons in order to produce her image of Hildegard as an enlightened thinker, deeply invested in the acquisition of knowledge. Bain’s analysis confronts a perennial issue, the distinction between medievalism and the reproduction of medieval music. Jacob Sagrans also takes up this issue in his discussion of the annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols services at King’s College. Media falsely imply that the Festival dates back to the Middle Ages, imbuing it with an aura of authenticity. Performances produce “new” medieval carols, much as Wagner composed his own imaginary version of medieval music. As well, the Festival plays a nationalist role, providing listeners with a sense of “timeless” English traditions. As Kirsten Yri argues, nationalist ideology also informs the neo-medieval metal band <em>Corvus Corax</em>. The band claims that its opera <em>Codex Buranus</em> recasts the German Middle Ages as a place of democracy and cosmopolitanism and rejects the National Socialist associations the <em>Codex</em> inherited through Orff’s <em>Carmina Burana</em>.</p>
<p>By bringing these diverse methodologies into dialogue with one another, the panel aims to extend Kreutziger-Herr’s paradigm in order to provide new metatheoretical structures for this emerging field.</p>
