<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>Musicology and ethnomusicology are routinely distinguished on the basis of their objects of study, sometimes characterized as “the West and the rest.” Yet this distinction has become as untenable, theoretically and politically, as the Hegelian assumption that historicity belongs to the West and its musics. The turn to critical musicology, on the one hand, and historical ethnomusicology, on the other, attests to a broad dissatisfaction with these inheritances, although they have not succeeded in banishing the geocultural and temporal distinction. There is, however, a growing body of work that points in the direction of a convergence of interests in the form of an integrative, global conception of music history.</p>
<p>This panel seeks to lay the theoretical groundwork for a critical world history of music, as it is beginning to emerge from this work. Taking inspiration from, among others, Philip Bohlman’s <em>Cambridge History of World Music</em> (2014), and Reinhard Strohm’s Balzan Prize project “Toward a Global History of Music” (2013–16), we begin with the position that the key problem to solve now is epistemological. Histories of the world’s musical traditions are increasingly well documented; and yet, encyclopedic impulses cannot, by themselves, provide the tools to realize the potential of this avenue of research. Worse, they threaten to simply revive universalist Enlightenment epistemes that were thoroughly entangled with colonialism and emergent capitalism.</p>
<p>As a starting point, then, this panel looks for theories that will allow us to integrate the wealth of emerging, localized case studies. How, we ask, can we assess questions of scale? With what tools can we confidently talk about global phenomena, local phenomena, and those with historical trajectories that intersect in significant ways with the global scale? What tools will allow us to move between temporally localized effects and longue durée in global, local, and regional contexts? And how might we remain vigilant toward the tendency of such integrative knowledge to reproduce contemporary patterns of global dominance?</p>
<p>The panelists have distinguished themselves as historians and ethnographers of music committed to theory and to detailed investigation of local archives, languages, and music. Panelists’ research areas include early colonial transcultural musical contact in North America; music in the seventeenth-century Philippines; eighteenth- and nineteenth-century music cultures of India and the Malay world; orientalism and music in European and American missions to Palestine since the mid-nineteenth century; black-indigenous musical dialogues in the southwestern Pacific throughout the long twentieth century; and musical encounters between African diasporic musicians and their counterparts on the African continent in the late twentieth century. We all strive to make sense of the ways each of the histories we study are globally significant, even as they may not be universal. Whether focusing on coloniality, diaspora, paracolonial lineages of knowledge, subalternity, or on theory of the global South, we aim to demonstrate the capacity of musicology to comprehend historical systems beyond common Eurocentric narratives.</p>
