<p>In recent years, research on music and East Asia has achieved critical mass
within the AMS. Extending beyond the exotic representation of East Asia within
European and American music, this body of work draws on an eclectic array of
primary resources and methodologies. This panel unites a new generation of
researchers who deal with corpuses of texts, images, musics, and sounds flowing
in and out of East Asia. The presenters have deep knowledge of East Asian
languages and cultures and examine multiple Western and non-Western musical
genres. We aim to provide a comprehensive survey of methodologies, areas of
study, and interdisciplinary formations that currently inform global East Asian
music research.</p>

<p>While ethnomusicology has long been the disciplinary home of East Asian
music research, this panel consolidates an emerging framework that complements
the ethnographic study of folk music and departs from it. In recent decades,
the AMS has witnessed an emerging global consciousness, as evidenced both in
peer-reviewed panels (e.g., the 2017 panel on “Western Music and China: A
Chapter in Global Music History”) and non-peer reviewed panels specially
organized by the AMS leadership (e.g. the 2011 panel on “Teaching Western Music
in China Today”). Building on that momentum, we present papers that have a
close affinity with research directions broadly recognized as
<i>musicological</i> in orientation. Our papers are anchored in history, music
analysis, and visual studies, and we address avant-garde, Western, and hybrid
music. We are comprised of senior scholars in the field such as Thomas Irvine
(co-chair) and Noriko Manabe, as well as emerging scholars such as Jung-Min
Mina Lee (co-chair) and Gavin Lee (respondent).</p>

<p>Our papers are organized around the following research clusters: (1) the
impact and contestation of Western music as discerned in the emergence of new
hybrid genres in Korea (Hye-Jung Park), the Korean avant-garde (Jung-Min Mina
Lee), and the development of musical institutions of Western art music in Japan
(Brooke McCorkle); (2) “global intellectual history” (Thomas Irvine, drawing on
Moyn and Sartory’s concept), historiography of music in China (Gavin Lee), and
history of music theory in China (Sheryl Chow); (3) theory and analysis of
Chinese traditional music (Yawen Ludden); (4) visual culture of Japan (Matthew
Richardson) and multimedia studies of film, anime, and video games (Brent
Ferguson, Dani Osterman); and (5) transnational popular music (Noriko
Manabe).</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of this panel is that the presenters, who are often
individually experts in one East Asian country, will collaborate on the
crafting of position papers, with the aim of articulating connections between
multiple East Asian countries within each presentation. In this way, we model
collaborative research within a transnational framework. Eleven presenters will
speak for ten minutes each, leaving over an hour for general discussion from
the floor. The concluding goal of this panel is the formation of a Global East
Asian Music Research study group within the AMS.</p>
