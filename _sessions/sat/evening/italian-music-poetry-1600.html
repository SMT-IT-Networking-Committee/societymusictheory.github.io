<p>The decades surrounding 1600 were an age of tremendous innovation in Italian
secular vocal music. These decades saw not only the development of new madrigal
styles invoked by the <i>seconda pratica</i>, but also the emergence of new
genres, such as the aria, that strayed from polyphonic traditions. Far from
being a purely musical phenomenon, these innovations were in many cases fueled
by equally impressive changes in Italian literary culture. Thanks to authors
such as Torquato Tasso, Battista Guarini, and Giambattista Marino, among
others, a new literary aesthetics gradually replaced earlier canons, promoting
wit and sensuality over Petrarchan <i>decorum</i> and championing new lyric and
dramatic genres. </p>

<p>The goal of this session is to reinforce the centrality of poetry for an
understanding of Italian secular vocal music from around 1600. More
specifically, it will offer new insight on the musical reception of Tasso,
Guarini, and Marino, tackling issues such as the relationship between poetic
and musical form, and the transmission of poetic texts in and through their
musical settings. In so doing, the session aims to open new avenues for
research on the repertoire under examination and more generally on the
intersection of music and poetry. </p>

<p>The session will feature five speakers, all acknowledged experts of Italian
music and poetry around 1600, with five ten-minute presentations followed by
about one hour of discussion. </p>

<p>The session will open with the paper “In Praise of Teleology: Tasso’s Theory
of Poetic Form and Its Musical Ramifications,” in which Ricciardi will show how
Tasso’s goal-oriented view of poetic form, according to which each line should
build towards a closing statement, is reflected in his poems and their musical
settings. The following two papers, by Coluzzi and Carter, are entitled
“Guarini’s <i>Il pastor fido</i> and the <i>seconda pratica</i>” and “In Search
of a Line: Guarini’s ‘O come sei gentile’ and Its (Musical) Problems,”
respectively. Coluzzi will explore how the theatrical and stylistically hybrid
nature of Guarini’s tragicomedy <i>Il pastor fido</i> informed Monteverdi’s
<i>seconda pratica</i>; Carter will examine the musical settings of Guarini’s
“O come sei gentile” as case studies of the transmission of poetic texts
through literary and musical sources. The last two presentations, by Refini and
Giles, will focus on Marino. Refini’s “Dismantling the Stanza: Strophic Forms
into Non-Strophic Settings” will examine Sigismondo D’India’s sophisticated, if
disruptive, treatment of stanzas from Marino’s epic <i>Adone</i>. Giles’s “The
Art of Contradiction: Marinism and Music in the Early <i>Seicento</i>” will
show how Marino’s aesthetics of <i>meraviglia</i>, although criticized by
contemporaneous literary figures, opened avenues for musical experimentation
for composers, who became extremely fond of his poetry.</p>

<p>In the following discussion, presenters and audience members will be invited
not just to respond to the papers but also to consider their broader
ramifications for future research in the field by way of topics and strategies
for engaging with them.</p>
