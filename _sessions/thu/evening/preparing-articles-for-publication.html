<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Converting a Dissertation into Articles
    (7:30–9:00)</h3>

<p>This short session explores the challenges of converting a dissertation
into an article (or several articles), and proposes ways of effectively
meeting those challenges. The four-member panel includes authors who have
successfully done so, as well as editors who have shepherded that process.
Anticipated topics include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What are useful strategies for adapting the content of a dissertation within an article or collection of articles?</li>
    <li>What are some pitfalls to be avoided?</li>
    <li>To what extent should the author target the article for a particular journal?</li>
    <li>How might one structure a dissertation in order to facilitate its eventual conversion into articles?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparing Musical Examples, Graphics, and Audio/Visual Materials for Publication
    (9:00–10:30)</h3>

<p>The impact of an article is greatly influenced by the supplemental materials accompanying it: notated musical examples, graphics, tables and charts, and (in online journals) audio and video files. But creating effective materials can be a challenge, and journal guidelines tend to provide little guidance for how to do so. This session discusses (1) ways of maximizing the effectiveness of such materials, and (2) the “nuts-and-bolts” of generating them.</p>
