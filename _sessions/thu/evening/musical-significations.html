<p class="abs-title">Signification in Plurality: A Typology of Chimeric Environments in Polystylistic Music of the Post-1950s</p>
<p class="abs-author">Bruno Alcalde (Northwestern University)</p>

<p>Polystylistic works of the post-1950s offer a challenge for musical interpretation. An initial, and superficial, approach is to consider these pieces as chaotic, trivializing the pluralism of their musical environments by considering it mere confusion. Scholars who have examined this repertoire have typically approached it either from a narrative perspective (Dixon, 2007; Tremblay, 2007) afforded by trajectories from one style to another, or by focusing on the techniques involved in these trajectories (Losada, 2008, 2009). However, both these perspectives are based on teleological processes and thus can only account for some of the polystylistic repertoire of the post-1950s, a time during which there was growing resistance to grand narratives. As a result, they leave aside music that—influenced by postmodernism—relies on plurality and disruption but dismisses any clear trajectories. I introduce the concept of chimeric environments, musical moments formed by mixture and/or distortion of disparate styles or topics that cohere as a unique amalgam. Next, I focus on five different strategies for stylistic interplay that form chimeric environments—(1) trajectory, (2) distortion, (3) coexistence, (4) importation, and (5) camouflage—and exemplify their characteristics with music by Kagel, Rochberg, Schnittke, and Sciarrino. I propose a broader classification of the types of interactions between disparate material while also retaining a teleological narrative outlook as one of the many interpretive possibilities. Importantly, this hints on vital problems of music communication in post-1950s music and its permeable boundaries.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Between Sign and Convention: On the Phenomenology of Modernist Musical Topics</p>
<p class="abs-author">Aaron Harcus (Graduate Center, CUNY)</p>

<p>Given Danuta Mirka’s definition of topics as “musical <em>styles</em> and <em>genres</em> taken out of their proper context and used in another one” and Raymond Monelle’s requirement that the indexicality of the musical sign’s content must be <em>conventionalized</em>, studies of twentieth-century topics have focused on the use of older topics, those <em>borrowed</em> from popular genres, or music associated with ethnic others rather than topics arising out of modernist aesthetics. There are two reasons for this: 1) the lack of a common language suggests this repertoire cannot have <em>conventional</em> signs; 2) the absence of a common syntax makes it difficult to see how any set of structural features can give rise to a stable <em>signifier</em> that is <em>correlated</em> with an expressive content (<em>signified</em>).</p>
<p>In this paper I reexamine the roles of conventionalization and correlation in semiotic approaches to topic theory by taking a <em>phenomenological</em> approach to modernist musical topics organized around a case study of a newly proposed topic, <em>Estrangement</em>, which I develop as an <em>intertextual code</em> (Klein 2005). Two consequences are drawn from this case study. First, I reorder the priority of icon and index discussed by Mirka, and suggest the indexicality of the content is experienced before the iconic resemblance and helps <em>motivate</em> the particular intertextual network brought to bear in ongoing experience. Second, I suggest the use of intertextual codes eliminates the distinction between individual cognition and social meaning and can serve as a useful aid to interpreting musical structure in the more elusive works of modernism.</p>
