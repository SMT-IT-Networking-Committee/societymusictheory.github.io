<h2>Part I</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Massimiliano Guido, General Introduction</li>
    <li>Peter Schubert vs. Peter Schubert (and the
        audience), “<i>Super librum</i>. Improvising polyphony”</li>
    <li>“Father, Son, and Fantasia.” Pamela Ruiter-Feenstra improvises
        fantasias in the style of J.S. and C.P.E. Bach</li>
    <li>“A Galant Conversation Surrounding Mozart’s K. 488,” Johnandrew
        Slominski and Gilad Rabinovitch</li>

</ul>

<h2>Part II</h2>

<p>Anna Maria Busse Berger (University of California, Davis) responds to the
performances; discussion follows.</p>

<hr class="sep">


<p>The study of improvised musics involves multiple disciplinary perspectives,
including historical and critical musicology, music theory and analysis,
ethnomusicology, and cognitive and empirical research. Historical
improvisation poses special challenges: it requires us to draw on period
treatises, notations that may represent improvisations or improvisatory
genres, and presently existing improvisatory systems. Moreover, scholarship
and practice go hand in hand: practical reconstructions of historical
improvisation—be they partimenti, improvised renaissance polyphony,
say—indicate some of the possibilities for working with the materials, while
the close study of treatises and repertoires enables the practical application
in improvisation—be they keyboard partimenti or vocal canons (Guido 2017).
</p>

<p>The study of historical musicianship also has considerable implications for
understanding notated sources: by understanding the cross-cultural continuum
of ornamentation ↔ free improvisatory genres (Jeffery 1992), as well as the
role of notation in learning and memorization (Busse Berger 2005), we may gain
insights into: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Relations between notation and musicianship (how does historical
    improvisation reflect on our understanding of a variation set, a rondo, a
    sonata, a fantasy, a notated imitative polyphonic piece)? </li>
  <li>Relations between historical European musicianship and presently
    existing improvisatory genres </li>
  <li>(notated/oral) Implications for teaching music theory, musicianship
    skills, and music history in the twenty-first century: from “Monuments of
    Music Notation” to “reimagining historical improvisation”? Enriching paper
  training with voice and instrument? What are reasonable student projects in
  music history and theory that engage these complex theoretical problems?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The session consists of several improvisation/presentations reunited under
a general discussion, with a response by Anna Maria Busse Berger. The session
is built around four specific samples of improvised music that stimulate a
special interaction between a performer and a scholar in that particular
field. Our aim is to help the audience understand the generative process
coupling music creation in a particular style to the embodied knowledge
necessary to achieve it. Each music-making situation will focus on a possible
research related issue such as: compositional rules and internalized
knowledge; relationship between instrument and performer; embodiment. </p>
