<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>The year 2016 marks the centennial of the birth of Alberto Ginastera (1916–83), one of the leading twentieth-century composers of the Americas. This celebration offers an ideal opportunity to assess the historiographical tenets that have informed Ginastera scholarship to date and propose new ways of thinking about the composer in the next century. The canon of Ginastera research was formulated by the composer himself, who worked closely with his former student Pola Suárez Urtubey to produce the earliest studies of his life and works (1967, 1972). Her writings provide the first classification and periodization of the composer’s music, and organize empirical data into bibliographies, discographies, and catalogues of works. In subsequent decades, a focus on the structural analysis of the composer’s music prevailed, notably in the works of the Argentine musicologist Malena Kuss. These studies have traditionally provided the framework for subsequent scholarship up until the present.</p>
<p>This session seeks to open new lines of inquiry that extend beyond the dominant discourses the composer himself helped create. Inspired by cultural history and recent theories of musical meaning, we propose the idea of a multidimensional Ginastera, whose output was mediated by the complex spaces in which he worked and whose image as either a “nationalist” or an “internationalist” has been shaped by the politics of representation. The first panelist and special guest, Esteban Buch, will address Ginastera’s residence in Switzerland (1971–83). His paper assesses Ginastera’s attitudes toward the last Argentine military dictatorship, and discusses his project to write an opera on <em>Barrabas,</em> based on a play by the Belgian author Michel de Ghelderode. Eduardo Herrera focuses on Ginastera’s activities as Director of the Centro Latinoamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales (1962–71). His presentation examines the ways in which the composer negotiated the local dictatorship as well as international Cold War politics to pursue his activities as an artistic entrepreneur. Melanie Plesch uses her adaptation of topic theory to Argentine art music to examine recurring <em>topoi</em> across Ginastera’s oeuvre. With the aid of this analysis she questions the political implications of the use of the term “nationalism” in relation to the composer and offers a critique of Ginastera’s representation in mainstream literature. Deborah Schwartz-Kates examines the composer’s conflicts during the early years of the Perón government (1943–52), analyzing how Ginastera navigated the system by using strategies of withdrawal and resistance in his film music of the period.</p>
<p>Moving away from Ginastera <em>el maestro</em> to Ginastera the human being with all his contradictions and conflicts, these presentations introduce vibrant new perspectives welcoming the composer into his next century.</p>
