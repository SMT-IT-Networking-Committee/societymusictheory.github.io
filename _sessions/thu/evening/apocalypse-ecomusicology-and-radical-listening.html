<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>There are few burgeoning subfields in musicology that garner a sense of urgency like that of ecomusicology. The global reach and effects of anthropogenic climate change and large-scale technogenic devastation, from nuclear issues to chemical incidences, for example, mark an interconnectedness of crises that are often homogenized and made digestible by media representations. The affective scope of musicological scholarship as ecocritical humanistic inquiry is being called on to offer counter-narratives to these models. As we query sustainability as a broader care for each other and the environment (Kinnear 2014), this panel turns to a robust ethics of the apocalypse offered by feminist and postcolonial ecocriticism to consider the role of radical listening (listening to the other) in our ecomusicological pursuits. Such work advances critical methodologies that take apocalypse as an invitation to ask how the relationship between eco-fear and communities imagined disposable is embedded into expressive culture.</p>
<p>This panel revisits the apocalyptic mode to suggest it demands a more nuanced musicological treatment. Apocalypse, in its contemporary usage, refers to the end of the world—a doomsday scenario with religious overtones. These papers offer positions that consider the original context of apocalypse: the disclosure of secret or hidden knowledge through aural cues to a particular listener. In response to Alexander Rehding’s questions concerning the efficacy of crisis-based representation in ecomusicology (“Ecomusicology between Apocalypse and Nostalgia,” 2011), each panelist takes a different topical ecocritical concern and positions it within the larger discursive strategies of the apocalyptic mode of engagement. We query the oft-subjugated role of music in theorizing not only the political draw of the apocalyptic (spectacle) but the affective, political engagements that can be maintained thereafter. Attending to different historical time periods, media, and geographical locales, each paper extends and expands questions concerning the role of radical listening in uncovering the complex constellation of environmental and social injustices and the broader systemic oppressions they uncover through apocalypse, working at the limits of concealment and revelation through imaginative interplays of silences, erasures, and emergent sounds.</p>
<p>Christopher DeLaurenti asks, “Can listening help those who survive after us hear in the future, especially to avoid the mortal danger of nuclear waste repositories?” His talk contemplates possible sonic warnings, post-apocalyptic soundscapes, and listening strategies to deter our descendants from exploring the nuclear waste stored at various power plant sites in the continental United States.</p>
<p>Noriko Manabe details how survivors of the atomic bombings recall a shining B-29, a blinding light, and when they came to, an eerie silence of a devastated landscape. They heard choruses of people begging for water, mothers calling for their children, people singing until they died, and the gravely injured treading aimlessly, all of whom could more easily be seen than heard in the darkness and fire under the mushroom cloud. These sounds are brought to life in Japanese compositions about the event. Setting the poetry of witnesses Hara, Tōge, and Yamada, the music of Ōki, Hayashi, and Hayakawa provides iconic sound images of falling bombs, raging fires, and the dying, and the emotions of those witnessing the atomic catastrophe. In so doing, they reflect upon the unadorned, real aesthetic of survivors’ poetry.</p>
<p>Jessica Schwartz discusses lament-based counter-narratives to the apocalyptic spectacle of nuclear devastation in the Marshall Islands. She describes the nuclear catastrophe as the event that causes a fissure, according to Marshallese, between their bodies and souls. In attempts to cope collectively in nuclear exile, Marshallese use the event as a catalyst for recalling the memory of the senses (Seremetakis) and construct an empathetic mode of listening attuned to the soul’s lament in counterpoint with the continued cries of the community. The juxtaposition of the two offer layered commentary on gendered disposability and environmental injustices.</p>
<p>Mitchell Morris explores how the word apocalypse is used in current parlance to refer to the end of the world (more properly termed the <em>eschaton</em>); in its original context, however, it refers to the unveiling of secret knowledge and hidden things revealed to a special listener. Both senses of the world are salient in Todd Haynes’s 1995 film <em>Safe</em>, in which a San Fernando Valley housewife named Carol White inexorably becomes subject to environmental illness, and in seeking protection, ends up isolated in a sterile pod owned by a health cult in the deserts of New Mexico—but still getting visibly more ill. Haynes’s film ponders issues of race, gender, class, and the notions of environmental toxicity in a rich but unsettling way made all the more complex by his subtle management of the film’s mise-en-bande. Morris’s remarks will highlight the role of sound as a conveyer both of “hidden knowledge” of poisoned doom in Carol White’s environment and as an ironic reflection on the particular anxieties of her distinctively American ideas about nature, culture, and survival.</p>
