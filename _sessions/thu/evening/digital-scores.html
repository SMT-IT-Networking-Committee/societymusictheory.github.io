<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>The amount and variety of notated music available online today is expanding exponentially. The imprecise rubric “digital scores” comprises many distinctive species, ranging from scanned manuscripts and public domain publications to copyrighted and licensed editions, performance materials, and freely distributed contemporary works. This music comes to us from many disparate and disconnected sources, including academic institutions and organizations, commercial publishers, aggregators and resource providers, and the creative artists themselves. Navigating the wilderness of the World Wide Web to chart clear pathways to this content is an immediate and strategic challenge for scholars, performers, and librarians alike.</p>
<p>Ongoing projects by research libraries to digitize and make accessible collections of early music manuscripts, autograph scores, and imprints produce an internationally shared, virtual online library of primary sources. Keeping up with these independent initiatives and pinpointing their individual items, however, can be daunting. Databases and portals for locating this material online include both established resources and new directions that point to digitized scores or integrate links to images within bibliographic descriptions. Since this content often lies beyond the reach of general search engines, many of these tools require internal exploration, and all have varying approaches to metadata, description, and linkage to digital assets.</p>
<p>The Web now hosts a rising number of recent scholarly editions of composers’ complete works and historic repertoires accompanied by expert commentary and critical documentation. These specialized projects complement the much larger, digitized collections of published music in diverse genres from the nineteenth through early twenty-first centuries provided by institutions and library consortia, limited liability companies, resource providers, and publishers. Although out-of-copyright and certain licensed scores are freely available from many of these websites, fee-based, often proprietary resources can offer advantages and unique features for discovery. Means for disseminating online scores also vary, with distributors providing access to public domain materials and vendors offering licensed scores previously published in physical editions.</p>
<p>Increasing adoption of contemporary songs and jazz as teaching materials for music theory and history courses and applied music instruction blurs the lines between popular and art music in today’s classroom and studio. Sheet music for this repertoire can appear in fee-based or free digital format only, usually without means for academic access. Librarians face a challenging landscape to support this curriculum in making these scores accessible while navigating the legal rights and limitations of educational use.</p>
<p>Today’s composers increasingly conduct their careers outside the channels of commercial publishing, opting instead to self-publish their scores and distribute them directly from their own websites. Library acquisition routines are not well connected to these self-publishing composers, resulting in a widening gap between collections nationwide and a vital sector of the contemporary music world. Librarians must therefore adapt practices to fulfill their collective mission to document and preserve the music of our time for researchers, composers, and performers, present and future.</p>
<p>This evening, seven librarian-musicologists from major music research and performance libraries address digital scores from several angles by discussing the content types and their providers, pathways and portals for discovery, obstacles and solutions for access and preservation, and the prospects for the future as more and better connectivities and collaborations develop. Their presentations are as follows.</p>
