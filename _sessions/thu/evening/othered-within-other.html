<p>Issues of authenticity and ownership of music and scholarly discourse
related to music have been subject of a continuing conversation in musicology,
particularly concerning the outsiders’ authority to research and discuss the
music of a community to which they do not belong. On a broad scale, these
concerns have dominated American cultural dialogue in many ways, especially
within the last decade: how can we contextualize and conceptualize authority
when men speak about (and often for or over) women, white people speak over
black people, heterosexual/cisgender lawmakers make decisions for LGBTQ
people, so on and so forth? These questions are likewise found in discussions
about music, specifically as related to cases of white artists appropriating
and profiting from music of the African diaspora, and in the academy, with
white scholars writing about music of black people, often at the expense of
black scholars. Fewer conversations, however, have been held within
musicological community questioning how various identities—Jewish and
non-Jewish—interact with and intersect within Jewish Studies in music. </p>

<p>While in some cases, contributions to Jewish Studies in music by non-Jewish
scholars has been well received, in others they have been dismissed as
inauthentic or invasive. In extreme cases, non-Jewish scholars, many of whom
strongly identify with the Jewish people, have been criticized as
romanticizing the darker elements of Jewish history or cashing in on Jewish
memory. Non-Jewish scholars subjected to this type of extreme view have
automatically been blocked from archives or denied access to research
materials based solely on their identity. In such instances, the question of
“Are you Jewish?” becomes a criterion by which a scholar’s ability is being
judged.</p>

<p>There are also scholars who are “othered within the other.” Otherness and
Jewishness have too often been synonymous, and this also extends to Otherness
within the Jewish community itself, especially as it relates to queer and
black people. More conservative Jewish communities do not always welcome LGBTQ
people. It is especially difficult for transgender and gender non-conforming
people to integrate, as their physically embodied queerness cannot be
concealed, especially if they have undergone a medical transition. Similarly,
the systemic discrimination that African Americans face is also prevalent
within some Jewish communities. In such cases, scholars encounter barriers to
participation in communal music practice/worship and performance as well as
restrictions to conducting fieldwork and accessing research materials.</p>

<p>This panel aims to hold a meaningful conversation about these intersections
and how they impact navigating research in the area of Jewish Studies and
Music. Furthermore, the panelists will seek to propose potential ways of
addressing these issues within the American Musicological Society, a
predominately white, cis/heteronormative, non-Jewish organization. Each
scholar will share their experiences within the academy and within Jewish
communities and consider the ways their identities intersect with those
experiences with the goal of highlighting the challenges and advantages of
approaching research in the discipline of Jewish Studies in Music.  </p>
