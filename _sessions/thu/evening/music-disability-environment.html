<p>Since its inception, disability studies has had strong ties to activism. In
her groundbreaking study of the field, Simi Linton situates disability studies
as a “juncture that can serve both academic discourse and social change,” a
means of holding the academy accountable for the social consequences of our
research and teaching (Linton 1998). Similarly, scholars of ecocriticism have
insisted that “the urgency of the moment suggests that ecocritics must reflect
upon, when it comes to the effectuality of their product, <i>the character and
quality of their ecological engagement</i>” (Major and McMurry 2012).
Disability studies and ecocriticism also share a critical attention to the
built environment, whether as a structure that disables and enables human
bodies, or as one that interacts with and integrates into existing ecosystems.
Over the last decade, music scholarship on both disability and
environmentalism has flourished, contributing to a greater understanding of
embodiment, subjectivity, intersectionality, sustainability, and technological
mediation in music: disability studies’ and ecocriticism’s common emphasis on
activism, inclusive language, and accessibility grounds music scholarship in
the social, wedding theory to praxis. Yet rarely have these sub-fields been
put into dialogue.</p>

<p>By bringing disability studies, ecocriticism, and music research into new
dialogue, this session aims to define our relationship to activism as music
scholars involved in personal and/or professional engagement with disability
and/or the environment. What are our moral obligations as representatives of
“disability and music studies” or “ecomusicology,” and what are the ethical
implications of writing about these topics? What tactics can we adopt from
on-the-ground grassroots activism? How might we assume the role of public
performers as we endeavor to engage new audiences and new venues beyond
academia? How can ecocriticism and disability studies generate new thinking
around the human and environmental impact of music’s built-in
infrastructures?</p>

<p>In the spirit of public scholarship, we will interrogate how activism can
transform the intellectual, methodological, pedagogical, and institutional
scope of our disciplines as a matter of un-disciplining. The session will
begin with ten-minute lightning talks from our panelists. The session’s
panelists represent a diverse range of music specializations and ways of
engaging in activism both inside and outside the academy that we hope will
enrich existing discourse in musicology and music theory. Elizabeth J. (Ibby)
Grace will discuss the potential for music to intervene in public discourse on
disability by drawing on lived experiences, emphasizing how intersectional
disability identities and realities can lead public musicology forward;
Jessica Schwartz will present on the role of activism and creative dissent in
her research and pedagogy, including a recent course she designed titled
“anarcho-musicology: music &amp; anarchism.” Ailsa Lipscombe will discuss how,
within medical environments, attentive listening to tripartite conversations
between the interlocking forces of human, machine, and architecture reveals
ways of being and ways of knowing. William Robin will speak on how Twitter can
function as an effective platform for musicologists to amplify activist work;
Chantal Lemire will explore the relationship between music pedagogy and
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with reference to her own
experience and others who live with ADHD; James Deaville will discuss his
ongoing activism over disability rights on campus; and Rachel Mundy will
discuss music’s place in the posthuman and material turn, an intervention in
today’s discourse of ethics she calls “the animanities.”</p>
