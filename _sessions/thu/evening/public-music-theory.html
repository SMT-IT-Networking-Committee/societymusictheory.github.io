<p>Music theory, the most hermetic aspect of music studies, has built up a
forbidding aura. Even in the early stages of music lessons, theory is the part
that students often dread most. For some, there is a sense that music will
give up its most cherished secrets to those who have the key to unlock
them—and that key is music theory. But even for those most sympathetic to what
music theory to offer, analytical explanations often seem unnecessarily
complicated and full of daunting specialist language and dry technicalities.
How do we respond to these concerns and maintain the integrity of our ideas?
</p>

<p>Public-facing scholarship offers one way to take aim at this conundrum. For
example, in February 2015 the Society for Music Theory published the first
issue of SMT-V, a videocast journal “geared either towards the music theory
professional or towards members of the educated public.” Such a venture builds
on a long history of public music engagement with theoretical and analytical
discourse that dates back at least to the mid-nineteenth century, and includes
such twentieth-century luminaries as Donald Francis Tovey, Arnold Schoenberg,
and Hans Keller.</p>

<p>The six papers in this session show the great variety and vibrancy of
public music theoretical pursuits of the past and present, and will foster
discussion of how we might move forward with public music theory and analysis
in the future.</p>
