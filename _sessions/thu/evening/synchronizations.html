<p>Synchronization, or the structuring of simultaneity, has always been
central to musical practices and theories. Traceable in the musicological
discourses of song and polyphony, opera and musical theatre, it has become
prominent of late mainly in film music studies. But it is the current
disciplinary turn toward the medial status of sound within the complex
temporalities of film, dance, theater, and videogames that forcefully advances
synchronization as a pressing question. What is the meaning of the controlled
simultaneity of, say, a body gesturing on stage, a video projection, and a
recorded singing voice? More broadly, what are the stakes of the co-presence
of the live and the recorded, or of the “forced marriage” of the aural and the
visual? And what role is assigned to the spectator in constructing
synchronization as an experience?</p>

<p>This panel brings together a group of scholars whose diverse interests
converge on such questions. Chaired by Brian Kane, whose work on sourceless
sound has opened new avenues for thinking about synchronization, the session
will unfold as three groups of three position papers, each followed by a
period of discussion. Each short position paper will lay out the theoretical
stakes of a particular engagement with synchronization through a consideration
of a specific example (e.g. film clips, video, animation, rehearsal footage,
recordings broadly conceived). These examples, made available online before
the conference, will anchor the panel’s theoretical intervention on a material
level, thus informing and enriching the floor discussion to follow.</p>

<p>Upending traditional visually based notions of synchronization, the
speakers will present alternative theoretical models that interrogate, among
other issues, the status of intentionality, economies of liveness, and
technological mediation. Daniel Callahan examines synchronization in dance in
relation to affect and to “choreomusicality.” Alessandra Campana inquires into
the aesthetics and ideology of audio-vision through recent promo videos of
Warner Classics records. Attending to the myriad sound-image relations
engendered by puppetry, Hayley Fenn proposes a poetic model of
synchronization, which foregrounds the potential “looseness” of
synchronization effects. Marco Ladd advances the idea of an aesthetics of
substitution in practices of musical accompaniment to silent cinema in Italy.
Deirdre Loughridge expands the historical frame of synchronization, exploring
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century instrumental music through early
audiovisual technologies. Roger Moseley considers how modes and
representations of play construct distinct synchronization effects in various
musical settings, including the film <i>Baby Driver</i> and the video game
Rayman Legends. Stephanie Probst analyses the pedagogical annotations on
player piano rolls in order to investigate the relationship between
synchronization and simultaneity. Danielle Simon extends concepts of
synchronization to encompass the idea of fidelity in radio broadcasts of
Italian opera during the Fascist period, and Mary Simonson considers the music
and dance performances in American silent film exhibition of the 1920s.</p>
