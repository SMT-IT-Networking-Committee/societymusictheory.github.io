<p class="abs-title">Inspiration Porn: A Classroom Quandary</p>
<p class="abs-author">William Cheng (Dartmouth College)</p>


<p>Here’s what I have learned from my students: teaching disability in the music classroom poses a challenge because <em>music is Ability Studies.</em> In my paper, I present the obstacles and rewards in teaching cases of inspiration porn to undergraduates via overcoming narratives on reality television. I conclude with the quandaries of instilling values of cynicism versus optimism in my students: that is, a wholesale rejection of inspiration porn versus the tempered recognition that, if or when we do allow ourselves to be moved, different wisdoms may nonetheless come to us in kind.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Deaf Composer: Teaching Beethoven</p>
<p class="abs-author">Robin Wallace (Baylor University) and Jeannette Jones (Boston University)</p>

<p>Our presentation outlines a class session that begins with myths about how Beethoven experienced music, drawing on media depictions and familiar stories. We offer a more nuanced discussion of deaf musical experience based on interviews with current deaf musicians and bring this to bear in Beethoven’s music by examining some of his manuscripts and sketches that indicate Beethoven experiencing music in visual and tactile ways.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Teaching “Madness,” Teaching Schumann: A Workshop</p>
<p class="abs-author">James Deaville (Carleton University)</p>

<p>This presentation aims to open up a dialogue about how we present the lives and works of composers who experience the disability of madness, through a workshop on teaching Robert Schumann. Based on our knowledge of his life and works, we—the panelists and audience—will collectively reflect on pedagogical approaches to Schumann and his madness, which in turn can inform our teaching of other “mad” composers.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Disability Aesthetics as a Pedagogical Framework: Implications for the Study of Piano Repertoire</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stefan Sunandan Honisch (Vancouver, British Columbia)</p>

<p>This lecture-recital suggests ways of applying an aesthetics of disability to the curricula of undergraduate courses in piano repertoire. I will demonstrate my approach through two case studies: Frederic Chopin’s Fantasie in F minor, and Cesar Franck’s <em>Prelude Chorale and Fugue</em>, two works which demand very different kinds of virtuosity from the performer, and which therefore configure the reception of the bodies of performers according to necessarily divergent aesthetic frameworks. In exploring the ways that discourses of virtuosity implicitly and explicitly write the disabled body out of large-scale piano repertoire of the nineteenth century, my lecture-recital simultaneously engages the musicological and pedagogical limits of a disability-aesthetics approach.</p>
