<p class="abs-title">“Suffer the Little Children”: The Institutionalization of Craft Apprenticeship in the Conservatories of Europe</p>

<p>Conservatories, established as expressions of Christian charity toward orphans and street urchins, rapidly evolved to institutionalize the forms of instruction that previously characterized a master/mistress with his or her apprentices. Replacing the physical models of handcrafts (e.g., lasts for shoes) were mental models of polyphonic musical patterns. The bonded apprentices in Italian conservatories began work on the simplest of tasks, contributing to income-producing practices as best they could. As children grew, they could take on more significant and more remunerative tasks, fully in keeping with what today’s specialists in learning describe as “situated learning” in an “authentic learning environment.” Graduates of Italian conservatories were so successful in securing employment abroad that other lands set up local conservatories in defense. The Paris Conservatory was among the first and the most faithful to the Italian model. My talk will address how conservatories adjusted as they changed from elements of civic pride to organs of the nation state and then to degree-granting institutions.</p>
