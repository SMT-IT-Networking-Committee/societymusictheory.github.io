<p>Speaking of “the Enlightenment” as a single historical entity has become
increasingly problematic as scholars of French cultural life have recognized
the diverse outlooks evolving in that time, some of which do not fit the
supposed “liberal” model of enlightened thinking. This issue applies
particularly to musical culture, which related indirectly with formal ideas
and passed through a growing commercial network. Our proposal offers a panel
of four ten-minute presentations and a brief comment on them, inviting
discussion after the last two papers.</p>

<p>Rebecca Dowd Geoffroy-Schwinden will open the discussion, explaining why
she removed “Enlightenment” from her book title. As professional musicians
evolved from court servants to learned professionals in eighteenth-century
Paris, their pursuit of new legal, social, and institutional rights was rarely
rooted in abstract ideals espoused by Enlightenment thinkers. These
advancements were oftentimes a matter of practicality rather than liberal
social change. Despite the rhetoric of equality and harmony underpinning
Masonic ideology, musicians were admitted to lodges for their valued musical
skills but earned uneven social acceptance within the brotherhood.</p>

<p>Andrei Pesic will explore “Two Ways to Think about the Enlightenment and
Music: Ideas and Inadvertency.” Enlightened ideas often proved compatible with
religion, belying the assumption that cultural change resulted mainly from the
deliberate propagation of radical ideas. Instead, a heterogeneous public arose
for new practices in which secularization emerged inadvertently. Focusing on
the <i>Concert spirituel</i>, Pesic shows that the proportion of sacred music
declined not because of secularist ideas but rather the powerful expansion of
entertainment markets. The concept of “inadvertency” leads away from labeling
composers as “mouthpieces” of philosophies, instead offering a broader
understanding of music’s place in eighteenth-century society. </p>

<p>Georgia Cowart will focus on the Paris Opéra, known as “the Temple of
Venus” or “the Temple of Cupid,” as an early-eighteenth-century haven for
“libertinage.” Scholars now reassess the value and meaning of a libertine body
of literature for challenging preconceived notions of a monolithic
Enlightenment aesthetic and its partitioning into “moderate” and “radical”
camps. Critical approaches to “libertinage” can be applied to the hedonistic
world of the Opéra during the early eighteenth century. Cowart will examine
libertine topoi and strategies in works of André Campra and his
contemporaries, a couple of which find later resonances in Rameau and Mozart.
</p>

<p>Olivia Bloechl will discuss “Political Theology in the French
Enlightenment: The Case of the Late <i>tragédie en musique</i>.” She will show
that even as late as the 1780s a “political imaginary” undergirded the
make-believe worlds of this genre, characterized in revelation and sacrifice.
Political sacrality was not easily reconciled with the liberal political
reason that French thinkers developed, especially in the ways a tragédie
lyrique represented power, publicness, and society. This coexistence affords a
fresh perspective on the genre’s continuities, indeed, its conservatism. </p>
