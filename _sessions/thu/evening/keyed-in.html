<p class="abs-title">The Fonte Schema in Mozart’s Piano Sonatas and the “Possibly Corrupt Minuet” K331</p>
<p class="abs-author">David Jayasuriya (University of Southampton)</p>

<p>The recent discovery of Mozart’s autograph for the A major piano sonata K.331 focuses attention again on possible discrepancies in the editorial transmission of this work, and in particular on the problematic opening of the second reprise from the minuet. This is the passage for which Gjerdingen (2010) has controversially challenged the A minor reading of the <i>Neue Mozart-Ausgabe</i> (1985): he claims that as the passage from the minuet is a Fonte, it should therefore proceed to the tonic <i>major</i> key. In my paper, however, I will in turn challenge his conclusion.</p>
<p>Drawing both on empirical results derived from my study of Mozart’s piano sonatas, and on a specialised analytical framework for the classification and description of the Fonte schema derived from my study of Riepel, I will argue that an editorial interpretation based on the prototypical Fonte is not valid for K.331. First, the passage contains harmonic and hypermetric irregularities; second, the tonal destination of the Fonte is almost certainly not at the location Gjerdingen prescribes; and third, minor or modally ambiguous Fontes appear in other Mozart piano sonatas.</p>
<p>I propose that Mozart may have remained unresolved about the modality of the K.331 passage, and that seeking one definitive solution may be misguided. Historically-informed analysis must be applied here with caution, since referring to a schematic prototype, without regard to its specific manipulation in a given context, and without recourse to an empirical study of personal style within the relevant corpus, may lead to an incorrect editorial decision.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Foreshadowing of Crisis: Emerging Middle Keys in Schubert’s Development of the Three-Key Exposition</p>
<p class="abs-author">Aaron Grant (Eastman School of Music)</p>

<p>Recent analytical work has shown that Schubert’s “three-key expositions” find their origins in the eighteenth-century trimodular block strategy. Such an understanding invites the listener to partake in a musical narrative in which the secondary thematic zone (S) must overcome a particular “flaw” before arriving at the “correct S” and achieving resolution at the moment of essential expositional closure (EEC).</p>
<p>This study demonstrates how Schubert developed this narrative strategy within his employment of the three-key exposition, showing that the early-S tonal digression can be seen as more than simply the middle of a trimodular block. Instead, this material may be viewed as part of an overarching conflict narrative spanning the entire movement, involving a fundamental opposition between a problematized pitch-class and the surrounding sonata, which endures incursions on multiple scales. This paper shows not only that the composer employed this narrative tactic as early as 1813, but also suggests that this strategy may have driven his initial conception of three-key expositions. </p>
<p>Part one gives a brief overview of the origins of three-key expositions while simultaneously discussing a few features Schubert used to transcend the formal limitations of the trimodular block in his three-key expositional strategy. In part two, I show Schubert’s mature appropriation and elevation of this narrative tactic within his later works. Finally, I demonstrate how even from his first attempts at this expositional strategy, the young composer imbued his compositions with this embedded conflict.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Embodied Interpreting of Frederic Chopin’s Ballade in G Minor Op. 23</p>
<p class="abs-author">Charise Hastings (Tallahassee, FL)</p>

<p>The study of performed music has grown tremendously in the last thirty years, and interactions between interpretation and the physical act of playing are now being explored. In the area of embodied cognition, the work of such scholars as Candace Brower and Lawrence Zbikowski presupposes that conceptual knowledge relies on our physical experiences in the world, challenging the long-standing Cartesian model of the mind and body as separate entities. This paper, based on thirteen extensive interviews with pianists who have taught or performed Chopin’s G Minor Ballade, presents multiple approaches to learning the piece, demonstrating inextricable links between technique and expression. Four distinct but overlapping models of learning are identified: choreography, gestural grouping, linear motion, and phrase shaping. Each model can be classified according to type of performance cue—basic, interpretive, and expressive—as defined by Roger Chaffin, Gabriela Imreh, Anthony Lemieux and Colleen Chen. The first two models of learning concentrate on basic cues: choreography focuses on relaxed hand and arm motions, and gestural grouping uses physical patterns to reflect a musical idea. The models of linear motion and phrase shaping emphasize interpretive cues: linear motion draws attention to melodic voice leading by dividing the two hands into four voices, and phrase shaping arises from the music’s underlying harmony regardless of technical difficulty. These models demonstrate how expressive decisions originate and develop through various inputs from both the body and the mind.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Sounding Within: Structural Inner Voices in Brahms’s Piano Works</p>
<p class="abs-author">Diego Cubero (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>In tonal music, the inner voices generally serve a supporting role. In Brahms’s piano works, however, they often carry the structural melody. For a style where the melody normally appears in the upmost voice, its concealment in an inner part is expressively marked. If, as Frederic Rzewski has argued, the partly hidden quality of the inner voices adds a dimension of depth, the structural melody in the pieces I shall consider is buried deep within, imbuing the music with that inward quality long associated with Brahms’s works. </p>
<p>This paper examines three types of structural inner voices characteristic of Brahms’s piano music and argues that each of these may be heard as expressive of inwardness in their own particular way. The first type includes melodies enclosed in an inner voice by a covering tone. The second describes melodies that clearly imply a covering outer strand and a structural inner one, connecting the two through constant inward gestures. The third comprises melodies that emerge from a motivic transformation of an inner part, in a rather particular manifestation of Schenker’s “linkage technique.” </p>
<p>While Brahms’s piano works have long been characterized as inward, this paper explains just how they may be heard as expressive of inwardness, reconciling an important part of their reception history with a close analysis of their musical structure. </p>
