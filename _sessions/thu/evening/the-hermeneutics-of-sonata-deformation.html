<p class="abs-title">Shattering the Bonds of Nature: The Queen of the Night Invades Enemy Territory</p>
<p class="abs-author">James Hepokoski (Yale University)</p>

<p>As a number of scholars have noted, by the later years of his career Mozart set several of his operatic arias in dialogue with aspects of sonata construction. Some of them, for instance, start by laying out modular successions and action-zones characteristic of expositions. Of interest here are the minor-mode arias in <em>Die Zauberflöte</em> assigned to the Queen of the Night and to Pamina: “Der Hölle Rache,” and “Ach, ich fühl’s.” Notwithstanding their differing affective qualities these two arias’ structures, like mother and daughter, are complementary. This paper focuses on the former, a deformation of more normative sonata-like options within Mozart’s opera arias.</p>
<p>One way of approaching the Queen’s aria is to consider sonata-oriented formats as characteristically Enlightenment or high-galant preferences—within this opera, designs more associated with Sarastro’s (or Mozart’s) new-order, idealized world than that of the old-power traditions that the Queen is so venomously struggling to preserve. In that sense, by beginning her incendiary D-minor aria as a sonata exposition, the Queen invades enemy territory—the new-world format—in order both to ride roughshod over it and ultimately (“Zertrümmert sei’n auf ewig / Alle Bande der Natur”) to subvert it by undermining the normative symmetrical-resolution impulse in the format’s second half, only to jettison the whole structure at the end with a concluding line of arrogant recitative hurled forth to the gods of revenge. Both the aria’s poetic text and musical structure point toward the same negative end: a belligerently delivered, rear-guard assault on the modernizing, “natural” world.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Success of Russian “Failure”: Tonal and Post-Tonal Resolution in Twentieth-Century Russian Sonata Movements</p>
<p class="abs-author">Charity Lofthouse (Hobart and William Smith Colleges)</p>

<p>This paper engages twentieth-century Russian sonata movements through the lens of Sonata Theory, reexamining ideas of cadential “success” and “failure” via polystylistic and post-tonal cadential events. Limited by definition to tonal cadences, Sonata Theory’s Essential Expositional Close (EEC) and Essential Structure Close (ESC) are expanded to reflect three Russian techniques: (1) the use of alternate tonal events at expected cadential locations; (2) the use of non-diatonic progressions to delineate formal sections in ways that are analogous to tonal progressions; and (3) the use of thematic and rhetorical similarities between Russian sonata models and historical constructs.</p>
<p>Examples from Prokofiev’s Piano Sonata no. 4 and Shostakovich’s Fourth Symphony illustrate concurrent diatonic and non-diatonic trajectories. Prokofiev enacts both traditional i/III progression and large-scale tetrachordal motion Shostakovich emphasizes a hexachordal EEC/ESC relationship by rhetorically privileging the (012479) ESC over the movement’s C-minor resolution through dynamics, duration, and motivic emphasis. Scriabin’s Piano Sonata no. 6 forgoes tonality altogether for EEC/ESC realizations of a (013479) hexachord and its subset (01469). The T<sub>5</sub> relationship between its MC and EEC hexachords mirrors the HC/PAC motions typical in diatonic models, while the movement’s EEC and ESC feature (01469) pentachords related by T<sub>10</sub>, tracing the two-semitone-offset “progression” from OCT 0,1 to 1,2 (via 0,2).</p>
<p>These analyses highlight the tonal and structural importance of non-diatonic cadential sonorities in sonata-form movements, lay a theoretical groundwork for connecting such “failures” to the expressive dramaturgy of Russian practice, and further develop Sonata Theory’s notions of tonal “success” to include post-tonal relationships.</p>

<p class="abs-title">From Apotheosis to Breakthrough: Intertextuality and Climax in Rachmaninoff’s Fourth Piano Concerto</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stephen Gosden (University of North Florida)</p>

<p>In the first movement of Rachmaninoff’s Fourth Piano Concerto, the return of the primary theme does not materialize as expected at the beginning of the recapitulation. Instead, there is a seemingly explicit reference to the composer’s First Piano Concerto—specifically, to the central episode of that work’s final movement. In the original version of the earlier concerto, the thematic material of this episode returns at the end of the finale as an apotheosis. Though Rachmaninoff excised the apotheosis from the finale when he revised the First Piano Concerto in 1917, his exploitation of the apotheosis technique in his Second and Third Piano Concertos helped to entrench the lush sounds associated with this procedure as a mainstay of his compositional style in the public’s imagination.</p>
<p>In this paper, I propose a reading of the Fourth Piano Concerto in which this reference to the earlier concerto serves as the focal point in a network of structural, textural, and expressive intertextuality between Rachmaninoff’s final piano concerto and his earlier compositions in the same genre. In particular, I show how the climax of the first movement can be heard to transform the apotheosis of his First Piano Concerto into a kind of breakthrough‚i.e., a pronounced rupture in the musical discourse that undermines the possibility of a straightforward recapitulation. Ultimately, my goal in this paper is to show how Rachmaninoff’s last piano concerto both invokes and problematizes the musical procedures that made his earlier concertos so immensely popular.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Between the Signposts: Thematic Interpolation and Structural Defamiliarization in Prokofiev’s Sonata Process</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rebecca Perry (Yale University)</p>

<p>Implicit in most thematically oriented theories of sonata form is the claim that the central drama of the sonata occurs at the “signposts.” By this line of thinking, structural normativity is measured by the presence of certain generically mandated landmarks (Primary Theme, Transition, etc.), and formal nonconformity occurs when a sonata obscures, omits, delays, reorders, or otherwise modifies these landmarks. While such paradigms have produced much insightful analytical work, they tend to give insufficient emphasis to rich thematic unorthodoxies— interpolations, displacements, superimpositions, etc.—that occur <em>between</em> traditional theme-initiating signposts. Such theoretical paradigms become particularly problematic when applied to so-called neoclassical sonata repertories—especially the early works of Prokofiev—in which seemingly unremarkable thematic discontinuities between predictably situated sonata milestones often prove to have far-reaching structural ramifications.</p>
<p>My paper explores the manner in which one branch of these thematic eccentricities—namely Prokofiev’s strategy of interpolating motivically unrelated material in the middle of a traditional theme-space—ironizes a seemingly normative sonata process in the first movement of his Second Piano Sonata (1912), rendering it an empty frame from which the expected motivic and thematic contents have been hollowed out and replaced. I invoke Russian Formalist Boris Tomashevsky’s concept of “bound” and “free” motifs—in conjunction with Viktor Shklovsky’s larger theory of <em>fabula</em> (story) and <em>syuzhet</em> (emplotment)—as a framework for clarifying and contextualizing the subversive structural function of Prokofiev’s interpolations within his larger sonata text.</p>
