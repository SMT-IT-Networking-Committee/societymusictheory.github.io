<p>The origin of Tex-Mex or Tejano music is deeply rooted in the rural,
working-class experiences of Mexican-Americans living in South Texas and the
Texas-Mexican border region. However, post-World War II migration to San
Antonio, the largest urban city in South-Central Texas, helped establish it as
the capital of a thriving contemporary Tejano music recording industry; home
to influential pioneers and aspiring newcomers of what is now recognized as
one of the country’s most celebrated American regional music traditions.
Sound, style, and place are intimately linked in the performance practice and
popular imagination of American music, as evidenced by the musical history and
celebrity of cities like Chicago, New York, and New Orleans. However, the San
Antonio sound has been overlooked and marginalized, likely because it is
largely sung in Spanish, causing it to lie somewhere between folk and popular
music. As a result, Tejano music often appears as a footnote in both scholarly
and popular literature on American music history. San Antonio, however, is
home to a thriving, regionally supported recording industry that has produced
iconic innovators of two distinct styles: the folk-pop conjunto and the
commercial <i>música tejana </i>(or conjunto progressive). While
conjunto—featuring button accordion, <i>bajo sexto </i>(Mexican 10- or
12-string guitar), bass, and drums—is recognized and emulated internationally,
the “progressive” sound expands the traditional instrumentation to include
keyboards, saxophone, electric guitar, and percussion and drives much of the
regional industry while eschewing global interest. Both reflect a dynamic
Tejano identity, contribute to the city’s cultural capital and tourist
economy, and are sustained by various community initiatives and heritage
management projects.</p>

<p>This panel features three scholars from musicology, music theory, and
ethnomusicology joined by a San Antonio-based Tejano music producer/engineer
and a musician/bandleader/producer as respondents and presenters. Both are
Grammy Award recipients. Session organizer and Chair/Moderator is
ethnomusicologist and former <i>San Antonio Express-News </i>Tejano and
popular music critic Cathy Ragland (University of North Texas).</p>
