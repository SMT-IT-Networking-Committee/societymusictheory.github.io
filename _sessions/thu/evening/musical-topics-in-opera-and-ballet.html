<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Topic theory has been richly augmented by scholarly contributions to the OUP’s Handbook of Topic Theory (Mirka 2014) and other recent publications. Moving beyond Leonard Ratner’s description of topics as “a thesaurus of characteristic figures” in Classic music, scholars have stipulated more rigorous criteria for identifying topics and their expressive and formal functions in socio-historical contexts. However, aside from Wye Jamison Allanbrook’s writing on Mozartean operas (1983; 2014) and Clive McClelland’s work on <i>ombra</i> and supernatural elements in opera (2012; 2014), analytical application of post-Ratnerian topic theory has focused primarily on the importation of styles and genres in instrumental genres and secondarily on dramatic works.</p> 

<p>This special session aims to expand the scope of current studies on musical topics through their application to operas and ballets from the late Baroque to the present. How do musical topics reinforce, expand, or alter their existing meanings and functions as agents of dramatic expression? What formal strategies have composers developed in foregrounding new or existing topics to this end? How can we enhance topic-based analysis through its intersection with theories of meter, harmonic schemata, literary aesthetics, and narrative? In shedding light on these questions, this panel presents five papers that examine the formal, expressive, and symbolic functions of musical topics in a range of dramatic works.</p>
