<p class="abs-title">Analysis of Sonority as an Essential Tool for Motet Attribution</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jared C. Hartt (Oberlin College Conservatory)</p>

<p>Although only two motets have been assigned to Philippe de Vitry in any fourteenth-century musical manuscripts, no fewer than sixteen have been ascribed to the composer by modern scholars through various means: examination of isorhythmic and other rhythmic properties, internal evidence from poetic texts, transmission of motet poetry without music, and citations of motet titles in treatises and literary sources. Analysis of sonority, however, strongly suggests that many of these motets cannot be the work of the same composer. Consequently, I argue in this paper that a systematic examination of sonority usage and patterns must be regarded as an essential analytical tool when tackling the thorny issue of motet attribution.</p>
<p>I take as my source group sixteen three-voice motets that have been ascribed to Vitry at various times with varying degrees of certainty: eight from <i>Le Roman de Fauvel</i>, one from the Cambrai manuscript, and seven from the Ivrea Codex. Analysis of sonority in these motets reveals several recurring patterns of sonority usage, but also numerous anomalies, which in turn raise many interesting questions. For example, if Margaret Bent is correct that the three Marigny motets (<i>Aman</i>, <i>Garrit</i> and <i>Tribum</i>) as well as <i>Floret</i> were composed roughly contemporaneously with – and specifically for – the compilation of <i>Fauvel</i>, then my findings suggest that Vitry is not the composer of all of these motets. In sum, through discussing several pairs and small groups of motets, I demonstrate that analysis of sonority can both support and, conversely, attenuate a Vitry motet attribution.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Hegel’s <i>Klang</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Gallope (University of Minnesota)</p>

<p>The term <i>Klang </i>has linguistic roots in the Latin <i>clangere </i>(to clang, sound, or resound) and Greek <i>klazo </i>(to make a sharp piercing sound). Before Hugo Riemann adopted <i>Klang</i> to indicate the ontological basis for a theory of harmonic dualism or Heinrich Schenker used it to denote a natural sonority, G.W.F. Hegel gave the term a strikingly philosophical account. Scholars have written about Hegel’s musical thought with respect to his version of a Romantic hierarchy of the arts, his interest in Italian opera, and his skepticism about the value of instrumental music (Schnädelbach, 2003, Sallis 2008, Bonds 2014)<i>.</i> Yet outside of scholarship on Jacques Derrida’s commentary in his book <i>Glas </i>(1974), comparatively little has been written about Hegel’s writings on <i>Klang. </i>In the <i>Encyclopedia </i>(1817), Hegel defines <i>Klang </i>as a gravity-defying form of homeostasis, a being with the unique ability to hold an inconsistent medium together over time with a measure of consistency: a “cohesion displaying itself in motion.” In the context of Hegel’s <i>Naturphilosophie</i>, <i>Klang’s</i> “elasticity” exemplifies the way matter dialectically produces ideal unities: it is a form of material cohesion in which a body preserves itself despite the violent unpredictability inherent to the passage of time. Through an explication of Hegel’s<i> </i>treatment of this term, this paper proposes to better understand its role in the history of music aesthetics, and discern ways in which it might be understood as a forerunner to other, more recent ontologies of sound.</p>

<p class="abs-title">From Squeezebox to Spectra: Gérard Grisey and the Accordion</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jonathan Goldman (University of Montreal)</p>

<p>It is tolerably well known that Gérard Grisey’s first instrument was the accordion, but beyond this fact, little has been said about the influence the pioneering spectral composer’s main instrument had on his later compositional language. Current accounts of Grisey’s musical education (principally Baillet 2000) leave obscure the composer’s formative musical activity in the 1960s. This period was marked by the centrality of the accordion and saw the completion of his first youthful compositional essays, most of which were scored for the accordion, including his first published work, composed when Grisey was 16. It was also the period in which he studied at a school specifically devoted to the accordion, in Trossingen, Germany, where he also received composition lessons from the neoclassical composers Helmut Degen and Wolfgang Jacobi. Immediately after his studies in Trossingen, he composed a substantial work for accordion, the <i>Passacaille </i>(1966), that would gain him entrance into Messiaen’s composition class at the Paris Conservatoire. Later, as a student in Paris, Grisey would distance himself from the accordion, writing in 1969 to a friend that “my way is another one.” And yet, Grisey would go on to employ the accordion in several of his later works (<i>Dérives</i>, <i>Partiels</i>, <i>Modulations</i>,<i> Transitoires </i>and <i>Épilogue</i>). After establishing the basic chronology of Grisey’s engagement with the accordion, this talk will assess the extent to which the spectral composer’s musical training on the accordion left traces in his mature compositional language.</p>

<p class="abs-title">An “Ideal” Music: Hugo Riemann and Nineteenth-Century Experiments in Enharmonic Keyboard Design</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel Walden (Harvard University)</p>

<p>This paper explores the influence of enharmonic keyboards featuring more than twelve notes per octave on Riemann’s early theories of tonal space, with particular attention to the work of Japanese scientist Shohé Tanaka. In 1890, Tanaka unveiled an <i>enharmonium </i>capable of performing even the most complex chromatic repertoire in just intonation, earning the admiration of Riemann and others, including Carl Reinecke, Joseph Joachim, and Anton Bruckner. After examining the instrument’s history, I will explore Riemann’s discussions of its merits in <i>Katechismus der Akustik </i>(1891) as well as links between his <i>tonnetze </i>and similar models proposed in Tanaka’s “Studien im Gebiete der reinen Stimmung” (1890) to explain the tuning systems of enharmonic instruments. I will demonstrate that 1891 represented a brief but crucial period when Riemann speculated that enharmonic instruments could point to a utopian future in which just-intonation harmonies representative of the inner noumenal realm of “ideal” music could finally sound in the outer phenomenal realm of the “real world.” </p>
<p>Riemann deleted nearly all references to enharmonic instruments in later editions of his text as he shifted focus from physiology to psychology, coming to believe that musical artistry depends less on manipulation of external acoustical properties and more on inner psychological play. He decided in favor of practicality and expected that listeners to conventional keyboards could make with their imagination the same adjustments that Tanaka had configured into his <i>enharmonium</i>. Had Riemann not made this switch, however, his impact on contemporary theory might look quite different than it does today.</p>
