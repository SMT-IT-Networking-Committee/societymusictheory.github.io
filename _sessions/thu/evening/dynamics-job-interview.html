<p>This session focuses on the job interview for a music theory position at an
academic institution.  We will regard the interview as a <i>dynamic
</i>relationship between the interviewee and the members of the institution.
The session will explore in particular two aspects of the interview process:
(1) the dynamic between the applicant and a class of students during a
teaching demonstration, and (2) the dynamic between the applicant and the
search committee, as well as other faculty and administrators. We include
within this second category those informal “down times” that are easy to
overlook, such as meals with the committee, or even chats in the hallway. The
focus, then, is not so much on what the applicant should be prepared to
<i>demonstrate</i> (as though trying to impress an impassive audience), but
rather how the applicant can <i>engage with</i> students and faculty in a way
that will be rewarding for all parties involved.</p>
<p>With regard to the classroom demonstration, we will specifically consider
how the applicant can facilitate a dynamic classroom atmosphere and encourage
active learning in the short time available. With respect to the applicant’s
interactions with the search committee and administration, we will explore
ways in which the applicant can best prepare for the interview process, as
well as the interactional dynamics of the interview itself.</p>
