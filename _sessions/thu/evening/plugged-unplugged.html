<p class="abs-title">Identity and Orientation in Barry Truax’s <i>Song of Songs</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Danielle Sofer (University of Music and Performing Arts Graz)</p>

<p>Barry Truax’s <i>Song of Songs</i> (1992) for oboe d’amore/English horn and two digital soundtracks sets the erotic dialogue between King Solomon and Shulamite from the biblical Song of Solomon text. On the soundtracks we hear a Christian monk’s song, environmental sounds (birds, cicadas, and bells), and two speakers who recite the biblical text in its entirety, preserving the gendered pronouns of the original. By attending to established gender norms, Truax confirms the identity of each speaker, such that the speakers seemingly address one another as a duet, but the woman also addresses a female lover and the man a male. These gender categories are then progressively blurred with electronic imitation of the voice, with added harmonics (which seemingly transform the timbre of the voices), and with granular time-stretching, techniques that, together, resituate the presumed heteronormative text within a diverse constellation of possible sexual orientations. </p>
<p>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues that sexuality is historically organized as a negotiation between one’s identity and one’s orientation toward others, and, comparably, Dora Hanninen (after Lewin, Hasty, and others) has shown that the basis of cognitive chunking in music analysis is formed through segmented identities and directed orientations. In this paper, I examine how <i>Song of Songs</i> reorients prevailing norms of sexuality by playing with musical associations, aural conventions, text setting, and motivic treatment. In showing how Truax transforms and reorients the gendered voice, I bring new meaning to music theory’s existing terminology, imbuing established music-theoretical concepts with sexual themes commonly neglected in the discipline. </p>


<p class="abs-title">De rebus prius factis – Ernst Krenek’s Theoretical and Practical Approach to Electronic Music in the Context of Post-World-War II Serialism</p>

<p>Complex serial procedures played a central role in Ernst Krenek’s compositional style since his <i>Lamentationes Jeremiae</i> (1941/42), in which he applied rotational permutations of tone-rows. At that time he also drafted an oratorio, further developing serial techniques towards rhythm and form. This project failed due to conceptual and performance-related problems. However, in 1955/56, after writing a book on total serialism (<i>De rebus prius factis</i>), and obtaining the technology that enabled him to process complex microtonal and microrhythmic parameters electronically he was able to draft and compose that oratorio, named Spiritus intelligentiae. Working at the studio for electronic music in Cologne, next door to Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krenek became one of the forerunners of total serialism, a fact that has not yet been researched sufficiently.</p>
<p>This paper discusses Krenek’s serialism from various perspectives. First, the theoretical foundations of total serialism and electronic music, as Krenek described them in De rebus prius factis, are put into the context of theoretical writings of the time, notably those by Herbert Eimert and Stockhausen. Second, this theoretical concept will be discussed with reference to Krenek’s composition. Third, the analysis of these sources reveals this composition as a process that synthesizes strict serial calculations of pitch, timbre and duration with a mystical numerology, which derived from Krenek’s interpretation of the theology of Pentecost. Krenek’s text choice, and the conditions of the work’s conception and creation define Krenek as an “exile” composer both politically and aesthetically.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Preparing Electronic Music</p>

<p>John Cage’s incendiary visit to the 1958 Darmstadt summer courses is widely understood as a key moment in the relationship between the American Cage and the European avant-garde, and many discussions focus on the aleatory debates. In this paper, I turn our attention instead toward Cage’s earlier works with prepared piano, arguing that they are just as important to the Darmstadt-affiliated composers as the aleatory debates. Cage’s prepared piano work was known to the German-speaking avant-garde composers since Herbert Eimert’s November 1952 WDR <i>Nachtprogramm</i> broadcast, during which Eimert played Cage’s <i>First Construction (in Metal)</i>, and various other unspecified works for prepared piano. In this paper, I use analysis to show that Cage’s early work was seminal in two respects: 1) the prepared piano extended timbres beyond the realm of the acoustic, providing a much-needed model for new synthesized, electronic sounds and 2) the relationship between sound and silence in Cage’s music and writings provided a key framework to contemplate pacing in electronic music. Before the aleatory debates, the sound and pacing of Cage’s prepared piano works had a substantial impact on the first works from the nascent WDR electronic music studio.</p>

<p class="abs-title">From <i>Verstehen</i> to <i>Fasslichkeit</i>: Schoenberg Recording Technology Liner Notes and (Public) Musicology</p>

    <p>In <i>Zusammenhang, Kontrapunkt, Instrumentation, Formenlehre</i> and <i>The Musical Idea and the Logic, Technique and Art of Its Presentation</i>, Schoenberg outlined his view of music cognition, defining roles for composers and listeners. He believed composers focus on <i>Zusammenhang</i> (coherence), the logical presentation of musical ideas. He called the ability for listeners to follow this musical logic in an in-time listening experience <i>Fasslichkeit</i> (comprehensibility). The related concept <i>Verstehen</i> (understanding) describes the same process out of time. Schoenberg strongly believed that experience and training were essential for listeners to progress from <i>Verstehen</i> to <i>Fasslichkeit</i>. In short, he advised they listen to “many, frequently repeated performances.”</p>
    <p>Of the many technologies introduced in Schonberg’s lifetime, he valued the phonograph the most because it allowed listeners to initiate repeated performances at will. When Columbia released a recording of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> in 1940, Schoenberg attempted to take his ideas about music cognition to the mass market, asking that a miniature score be included with each album. His request denied, Schoenberg then began writing analytical liner notes instead.</p>
<p>In this paper, I review Schoenberg’s statements about cognition, particularly the concepts of <i>Verstehen</i> and <i>Fasslichkeit</i>. Secondly, I trace the histories of his various liner notes, showing how they were motivated by his beliefs about music cognition. Finally, I show that in the two decades after Schoenberg’s death, liner notes rivaled academic journals and books as an important venue for disseminating Schoenberg’s thoughts about his own music, bringing them not only to specialists, but to the general public as well. </p>
