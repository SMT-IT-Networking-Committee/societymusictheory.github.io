<p class="abs-title">Glass Beads and Graphic Analysis: A Ludist Account of Contemporary Music Theory</p>
<p class="abs-author">Steven Beverburg Reale (Youngstown State University)</p>

<p>In positing “ludomusicology” not so much as the study of music in games than as a scholarship of music as informed by play, Roger Mosely (2012) draws a specialized focus on what McKenzie Wark (2007) calls “gamer theory,” a methodology that employs the logic of gameplay for the purposes of engaging in any kind of critical analysis. Casting scholarship as play is not a recent invention: historian Johan Huizinga’s influential <em>Homo Ludens</em> (1938) examines art, poetry, and philosophy as byproducts of the drive to play. Similarly, scholarship-as-play is a central theme of Hermann Hesse’s final novel, <em>The Glass Bead Game</em> (1943), concerning an isolated, monastic order of scholars playing the titular game by manipulating a secret language of hieroglyphs. The musicologically-oriented reader for whom the glass bead game calls to mind Schenkerian techniques is vindicated when the novel reveals its origin as an exercise in musical analysis. With remarkable prescience, the novel invites us to examine the discipline of music theory— with its rule-based systems of musical abstraction—from the standpoint of gamer theory. This presentation draws Wark to Hesse and considers several glass bead games played by music theorists: the pedagogical pencil puzzle of part-writing, the second-order <em>Singgericht</em> of score analysis, and the real-time strategy game of diplomacy and resource management of which academics are constant players.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Anne Young’s “Musical Games” (1801): Music Theory, Gender, and Game Design</p>
<p class="abs-author">Carmel Raz (Columbia University)</p>

<p>In 1801, Anne Young of Edinburgh was granted a royal patent for a set of six “Musical Games” accompanied by “an Oblong Square Box, [with] two faces or Tables, and various dice, pins, counters…to render familiar and impress upon the memory, the fundamental principles of the science of music.” Included with the games was a 300-page theory treatise doubling as an instruction manual. The first British patent ever granted for a board game, this was also the only patent awarded that year to a female inventor. As a music theorist, game designer, and entrepreneur, Young constituted a remarkable figure within the nineteenth-century musical landscape. She achieved significant critical success: her “Musical Games” were well reviewed in literary magazines, and her treatise appeared in two subsequent editions.</p>
<p>This talk investigates the role of gender in the creation and reception of Young’s “Musical Games.” Focusing on understandings of play within philosophies of education around 1800, I argue that designing educational games for children provided female musicians with a socially sanctioned platform to engage with music theory. I further show that female game designers frequently had to contend with the assertion that their inventions were overly complex, a charge that tended to arise when the demands of a game revealed aspirations beyond a juvenile audience. I finish by discussing a 1907 critique of Young’s invention by the prominent anti-suffragist Bertha Harrison, who maintained that female musical game designers tended to become so “engrossed with details, as to lose sight of the main issue.”</p>

<p class="abs-title">Music, Card Games, and the Play of Sensation: Kant’s Ludomusical Aesthetics</p>
<p class="abs-author">Tekla Babyak (Cornell University)</p>

<p>In the <em>Critique of Judgment</em> (1790), Immanuel Kant distinguishes between agreeable and beautiful types of music. He describes agreeable music as table-music (<em>Tafelmusik)</em> that accompanies other activities, while beautiful music engages the listener in a more complex process of reflection. Mark Evan Bonds and Emily Dolan have examined many of the concepts that shape this Kantian dichotomy, including timbre, musical autonomy, sensory perception, and sound waves. The ludomusical dimensions of Kant’s aesthetics, however, have remained unexplored. My paper argues that the idea of play is central to Kant’s distinction between agreeable and beautiful music. For Kant, agreeable music affords a playful diversion tantamount to jokes or card games. Beautiful music enacts a more serious and abstract form of play: the “free play (<em>Spiele)</em> of sensations.” Kant thus establishes a dichotomy between amusing and serious forms of musical play. Building on Roger Moseley’s analysis of the relationships between music and games (JAMS, Spring 2016), I argue that Kant’s theories of play offer us new insights into the musical cultures of the late 18th century. Elaine Sisman has situated Mozart’s “Jupiter” symphony (1788) in the context of the Kantian sublime, but I suggest that the contrapuntal play of motives brings this symphony closer to Kant’s conception of the beautiful. Agreeable play, the other pole of Kant’s dichotomy, finds musical expression in Mozart’s <em>Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</em> (1787). I conclude that Kant’s ludomusical aesthetics enable us to hear modes of play in the works of Mozart and his contemporaries.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Beyond (the) Halo: Chant in Video Games</p>
<p class="abs-author">Karen Cook (University of Hartford)</p>

<p>A current trend in ludomusicology is the study of previously composed music, whether popular or “art,” in games: for example, William Gibbons’s analyses of popular music in <em>Bioshock</em> and classical music in Nintendo games; or Kiri Miller’s work on the radio in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. Yet in that vein, little has been articulated about plainchant in video games, perhaps for several reasons: first, from a technological-musical standpoint, chant presumes voice, which eliminates a large swath of game soundtracks from contention; second, separating the texts and melodies of plainchant from modern variants or interpretations is difficult; and third, from a historical-musical standpoint, what might thus be considered ‘actual’ plainchant occurs only minimally (and from a liturgical standpoint, it could be argued that none occurs at all). Those instances in which the texts and melodies of plainchant are manipulated in a game’s soundscape are thus all the more interesting and warrant further investigation. Drawing on scholarship in chant studies, medievalism, video game music, and film studies, I discuss the function of chant as trope, signifying three main themes: a spiritual or religious setting; a particular geographic or historical scene; and the presence of evil, battle, or death. I question whether chant actually necessitates vocality or whether it can occur in a purely instrumental or digital fashion. Lastly, I explore several digital tools for composers that help to explain the presence of certain elements of chant within video games.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Not Just Fun and Games: Musical Indeterminacy as User-Generated Content</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kirsten Carithers (Northwestern University)</p>

<p>In the past decade, narratives of musical experimentalism have flourished, with a much-needed critical apparatus currently in development. In this paper, I examine some serious games (Ortner 2006) that challenge conventional modes of inquiry: Happenings, Fluxus events, and open-ended graphic and text notations, all of which trouble the fine line between work and play. As it turns out, concepts from gaming illuminate the heightened political stakes of this repertoire, that is to say, issues of power, control, and authorship. For example, much of the creative labor involved in realizing non-traditional notation can usefully be understood in term of modding and user-generated content, with musicians and gamers making similar investments in their creative worlds. Likewise, composer-performers including Cornelius Cardew and Charlotte Moorman hacked the scores with which they were tasked, subverting the authorial power of composers like Stockhausen and Cage. These issues all operate within the realm of what I am calling “interpretive labor” – i.e., the effort required to translate experimental scores into a sounding musical experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, thinking about avant-gardism in this way reveals the interconnectedness of these recent phenomena: both (video) games and experimental music are necessarily plural – art and craft, commerce and hobby, free and constrained. Ludomusicology, then, gives us an ideal toolkit for investigating and deconstructing indeterminacy in the arts – an otherwise undertheorized challenge to conventional composer/performer/audience relationships. By considering indeterminacy in terms of hacking and modding, we gain essential insight into its laden socio-cultural and political meanings.</p>
