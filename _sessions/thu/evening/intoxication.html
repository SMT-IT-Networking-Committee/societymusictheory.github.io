<p>For many philosophers, music and intoxication are powerfully intertwined.
The “music theorists of Dionysus,” Plutarch reports, drink wine and water in
accord with the harmony of the lyre; the best cocktail (producing the ideal
inebriation) is three parts wine to two parts water, the musical intoxication
of the fifth. For Adorno and Horkheimer, musical intoxication is akin to a
phantasmagoric delusion concealing reality and suspending one’s sense of self.
In Sufism, musical intoxication dissolves barriers between what is seen and
unseen; in such cases, self-annihilation is self-preservation. Even far
outside the annals of “official” philosophy, vernacular speculations recur at
the nexus of music and intoxication: in social and military battlegrounds,
around gateway drugs, behind and across police lines, in alliances with occult
forms and mysticisms, as triggers of social and metaphysical bonds, and as
blinding illusions or portals to the real. With remarkable regularity, musical
intoxicants seem to transfigure foundational concepts of the self, of logic,
reason, society, and being. In this session, five scholars tackle the question
of intoxication and music from a philosophical point of view. Their studies
range from subversive intoxications of seventeenth-century England to the
hypermodern ecstasy of electronic dance music.</p>
