<p class="abs-title">Schubert’s Idyllic Periods</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stephen Rodgers (University of Oregon)</p>

<p>Schubert’s song “Am Meer” opens with a theme of absolute purity and tranquility: two thoroughly diatonic phrases with only root-position tonic and dominant harmonies. The theme sounds pristine, however, not only because of its simple harmonic language, but also because of its simple <em>phrase structure</em>: it forms an archetypal parallel period. This sort of “idyllic period” is prevalent in Schubert’s output, particularly in his late Lieder, where one finds numerous periods with similar features: phrase-structural symmetry, harmonic-contrapuntal clarity, slow tempo, undisturbed diatonicism, transparent piano texture, and texts about idealized scenes.</p>
<p>My presentation examines three of these idyllic periods in detail—“Am Meer” and two other late songs that resonate with it, “So lasst mich scheinen” and “Am Fenster”—in an effort to understand how the shape of Schubert’s melodies interacts with the poetry associated with them. I argue that the period was not merely an abstract model for Schubert but a form with powerful expressive connotations, which he reinforced with related techniques. The idyllic periods in these three songs, for example, are juxtaposed with more agitated, chromatic, and thematically irregular sections; their piano textures are based on simple models, with parallel sixths or thirds in the right hand; and they evoke blissful scenes from the past or the future. Together, these songs show that theme-type was a key component of Schubert’s expressive vocabulary, and they suggest that Schubert’s evocations of naïveté and innocence demand as much scrutiny as his most radical experiments with tonality and form.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Between Half and Perfect Cadences: Alternate Antecedent Tonicizations within Parallel Periods</p>

<p>In some parallel periods, the antecedent ends with a perfect authentic cadence in a foreign key (other than the dominant). In such situations, the cadences that conclude the antecedent and consequent establish their hierarchy of cadential strength not by cadence type, but by key. Although such periods play an important role in nineteenth-century music, they remain underexplored in the music-theoretic literature.</p>
<p>This paper discusses the form-functional repercussions of such periods and proposes Schenkerian models for interpreting their voice-leading structures, as exemplified by excerpts from the nineteenth-century literature (e.g. Brahms, Chopin, and Dvořák). In some of these cases, the cadence at the end of the antecedent is best understood as a temporary step on the way to V. In other cases, however, the operative tonal procedures are more daring. Among these, the period that opens Dvořák’s op. 65/ii is particularly fascinating; it contains irregularities that allow for alternate interpretive possibilities, and its use of subtonic as the antecedent’s concluding key has implications that reach far into the movement.</p>
