<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>My talk covers three to five music exhibits, including <em>Bob Dylan’s American Journey, 1956–1966</em>; <em>American Sabor: Latinos Shaping U.S. Popular Music</em>; and <em>Nirvana: Taking Punk to the Masses</em>, each of which presented unique challenges and involved different partners. I will explore how we work with various artists, managers, and communities; how we try to bring narratives to life through artifacts, multimedia, and evocative design; the detective work that goes into finding key artifacts, which aren’t always in our collection (for example, we had no artifacts for <em>American Sabor</em>); and how our exhibits have evolved over the last fifteen years.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Music Re-materialized: The Revival of the 78</p>
<p class="abs-author">Elizabeth Ann Lindau (California State University, Long Beach)</p>

<p>Sound recording makes songs into tangible artifacts. In his classic book <em>The Recording Angel</em> (1987), Evan Eisenberg described Edison’s invention of the phonograph as the moment where “music began to become a thing.” But since 1877, recording formats have shrunken dramatically in size. The invisible and intangible MP3 is the culmination of this process. In his recent history of the MP3, Jonathan Sterne (2012) discusses the format’s “micromaterialization,” asking “Is Music a Thing?” As Mark Katz (2004) has written, the ease with which listeners can acquire and discard digital musical files leads to a longing for physical objects such as vinyl records. Vinyl has long been revered among serious collectors (Straw, 1997; Shuker, 2010) and hip-hop producers (Schloss, 2004) for its nostalgic allure and superior “warm” sound quality. This presentation investigates a more surprising comeback being staged by vinyl’s ancestor, the 78 rpm disc. I will survey post-2010 releases by Tom Waits, Jack White, Keb’ Mo’ and others that cultivate the 78’s sound or appearance. I pay particular attention to <em>The 78 Project</em> (2014), an album of Depression-era songs recorded in single takes on a Presto direct-to-lacquer machine (the same model used by Alan Lomax on his fabled trips through the South). Contemporary recordist Lavinia Jones-Wright carefully preserves the Presto’s imperfections, or what John Corbett (1994) has called “the grain of the record.” In contrast to the easy editing and audio fidelity afforded by insubstantial digital files, the 78’s material physical traces and surface noise become magical to twenty-first century listeners.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Rap’s Merchandise: How Commodified Musical Artifacts Affect Historical Narratives</p>
<p class="abs-author">Amy Coddington (University of Virginia)</p>

<p>The CD begins as many rap records from the beginning of the 1990s do. The rapper introduces himself and explains how the rest of the record is going to proceed. But this isn’t LL Cool J, who promised to “teach you like the master taught the grasshopper,” or the Wu-Tang Clan, who claimed they would “bring da ruckus.” It’s D.J. Doc Roc, who came to “teach you how to multiply.” The CD, entitled <em>Multiplication Rap,</em> accompanies a book full of math games, and each track on the album features “cool music for fun learning” that teaches the listener multiplication facts through rapped lyrics.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, companies capitalized on the popularity of rap among young audiences, manufacturing rap-inspired board games, action figures, school supplies, and records like <em>Multiplication Rap</em> for teachers to use in classrooms. Largely forgotten by hip hop scholars who tend to focus on the music’s capacity to express racial identity and political resistance, these commodified musical artifacts both contributed to and challenged hip hop’s growing investment in authenticity. Like <em>Multiplication Rap</em>’s mimicry of just the formal structures, not the lyrics, of rap albums, these artifacts selectively copied only certain visual and musical elements from the genre. And yet these consumer products molded contemporary opinions of the genre just as standard rap albums and videos did. Acknowledging these musical artifacts allows us to reimagine public conceptions of the genre, complicating and broadening our current musicological understanding of the history of rap.</p>
<p>This presentation explores the role of two kinds of musical artifacts—advertising flyers and bootleg tape recordings—in current research on “old school” New York hip hop. In particular, we suggest some of the ways that researchers can work with these materials to better understand the live musical culture that existed prior to and concurrently with recorded hip hop until the mid-1980s. Although initially created for particular purposes and with immediate uses in mind, both types of artifacts contain valuable historical evidence about a scene that continues to inspire much nostalgia but whose memory is rife with paradox and unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Instead of detailing the content of various flyers and tapes, this presentation considers the “liveness” of early hip hop events reflected in these types of materials.</p>

<p>We show how our research is informed by handwritten marginalia and other indications of the relational nature of early hip hop performance. In addition, we consider how our assessment of this “liveness” is impacted by our means of access to the materials and the technical and interpersonal issues that accompany them. We reflect on the differences between working with originals versus reproductions, and institutional archives versus private collectors. In sum, we hope to suggest a collaborative approach to researching early hip hop that combines archival research with oral history and ethnography to gain new insights into a past that few expected to be of great interest forty years in the future.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Anatomy of Style: Playing Technique as Musical Artifact</p>
<p class="abs-author">Deirdre Morgan (University of London)</p>

<p>The jew’s harp has, at various times, been one of the most popular musical instruments in Europe. First appearing on the continent in the thirteenth century (Kolltveit 2006), the instrument has undergone several cycles of mass production right up to the twenty-first century, and is currently experiencing a global revival. While it is easy to argue that musical instruments are musical artifacts, what about the techniques that are used to play them? In this paper, I contend that playing technique is an artifact that gets transmitted, historicized, and reproduced in the evolution of popular traditions. Using the ethnographic case study of the Austrian <em>Maultrommel</em> (jew’s harp), I analyze the ways in which a music revival writes its own history through the inclusion of certain techniques and the exclusion of others. By examining three centuries of <em>Maultrommel</em> playing techniques through visual artwork, archival recordings, and contemporary performances, I trace the lineage of two different styles of playing: the <em>Wechselpiel</em> style, which became canonized as “traditional” and registered with UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage, and the Alpine style, which is no longer used by present-day musicians. What are the processes that shape some techniques into artifacts and relegate others to obscurity? And what can the survival of certain styles tell us about changing tastes and technologies? Addressing these questions, I suggest methods for interpreting playing techniques, and demonstrate their applicability towards the understanding of popular traditions.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Visiting a Pedal Steel Graveyard: Instruments and the Valuation of Popular Music Artifacts</p>

<p>Instruments are among the most important artifacts of any musical culture, embodying its technological mindset, its musical principles, and its visual and sonic aesthetics. As the physical traces of an art defined largely by its ephemerality, they are essential for both historical research and the representation of music in museum settings. There has, however, long been a tension between the goal of preserving instruments as documents of their culture and the idea of instruments as living objects that suffer a “death” when they are displayed rather than played. The indignation often voiced in such claims belies the fact that value of individual instruments is determined by the narratives that surround them as much as their intrinsic worth as musical tools.</p>
<p>This paper will consider the valuation of popular music instruments through an exploration of the proverbial graveyard of pedal steel guitars located in Nashville’s Country Music Hall of Fame, which includes specimens played by virtuosos Speedy West and Buddy Emmons, and singer Barbara Mandrell, who began her career as “the Sweetheart of the Steel.” These instruments embody ideas of technological progress and musical tradition that parallel the narratives of country music, and raise questions about the benefits, limitations, and meaning of “vintage” instruments for both performers and audiences. By examining the narratives of popular genres along with the histories of their instruments, we can see not only new ways in which artifacts can be used for historical research, but also new avenues for pedagogy in both institutional and public forums.</p>
