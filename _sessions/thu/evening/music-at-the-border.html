<p>This panel explores the ways in which music reflects socio-economic and
political imbalances that shape notions of identity and culture. In this
light, each presentation emphasizes the role of music as a performative
platform that enables people to negotiate power asymmetries that, on the one
hand, marginalize them, and on the other, are the catalyst to re-imagine ideas
of belonging and history. It is in this sense that music functions as a border
zone through which people neither passively deny nor forcefully overcome
conflict. Rather, it the third-space of the colonial double-bind that
characterizes music practices and their identity politics in modernity. The
issue of “Mexican identity” is most relevant to this analysis, as it exposes
the racialization inherent in this process, a phenomenon that continues to
imbue perceptions of “Mexicanness” in the American imagination today. However,
these presentations highlight that, far from passively succumbing to the
xenophobic stereotypes promoted by recent American foreign policy, the
black-and-white depiction of Mexican border life, or the romantic and
sentimental images of 1950s urban nostalgia, the musical activity of social
actors raises complicated questions about culture and identity that have no
clear and easy answer. Thus, these case studies urge us to listen in
discomfort and to challenge the cultural images that inform our perceptions of
Mexican music.</p>
