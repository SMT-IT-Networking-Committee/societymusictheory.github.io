<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>In recent years, the Society for Music Theory has made strides toward greater inclusivity by embracing new repertoires and methodological approaches, and in so doing, has reshaped our definitions of music theory and music theorists. The four presenters in this session reflect on where we came from, take stock of where we are, and contemplate where we might go from here with respect to diversity in our discipline. The four papers also provide topics for breakout discussion groups: (1) diversity of topics in music theory, (2) diversity of cultural perspectives, (3) diversity in the classroom, and (4) diversity of analytical approaches. One goal of this session is to review our past; another goal is to map pathways into our future.</p>


<p class="abs-title">SMT Meetings 1978–2013: Which Composers and What Topics?</p>
<p class="abs-author">Cynthia Gonzales (Texas State University)</p>

<p>Since the first meeting of the Society for Music Theory in 1978, the discipline has diversified beyond sets, serialism, and Schenker to include non-classical repertoire as well as new approaches to the analysis of music. In the paper, I review the content of presentations at annual SMT meetings as a means of exploring how the discipline has changed since 1978: Which composers are studied most often? Which music-theoretical topics are explored most often? Which topics no longer receive attention at national meetings? And what are the new topics?</p>
<p>A preliminary survey analyzed content of eight meetings spanning 35 years, one every five years from 1978–2013. SMT meets jointly with AMS in odd-numbered years; thereby, joint AMS-SMT sessions are included. Session titles and individual paper titles are reviewed for keyword content. When available, abstracts are consulted.</p>
<p>The top three keywords in 1978 are Schenker, Schoenberg, and Serialism; all three recur throughout the years. Set Theory, on the other hand, registered by 1983, peaks in 1988, and departs before 1993. While some terms disappear, others enter. By 2013, eight different keywords not present in 1978 each have as many as nine entries and no fewer than four: Form, Pedagogy, Multimedia Analysis, Universal Design, Scalar Spaces, Performance Analysis, Rock, and Meter. </p>
<p>The data presented will review all SMT annual meetings from 1978–2013.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Diversity in the Classroom: Asian Composers in Form and Analysis Class</p>
<p class="abs-author">Tomoko Deguchi (Winthrop University)</p>

<p>Recently, I was granted a teaching load reduction by my institution in order to explore the possibility of integrating music that falls outside the Western canon into the upper undergraduate course Form and Analysis, specifically music composed by Asian composers. Despite the greater demand of inclusivity, the literature used in the Music Theory classroom is still predominantly composed by Western (European) composers. Asian composers are increasingly active in the concert scenes around the world; however, their music is mostly overlooked in the music theory classroom. This is also evidenced by the programming of the most recent conference of the Society for Music Theory in 2014. Only one presentation dealt with an Asian composer (Takemitsu). </p>
<p>In my Form and Analysis class, in addition to discussions on the traditional formal concepts such as cadences, phrase structures, and formal archetypes, I posit the following questions using Asian composers’ music: How are the boundaries of sections delineated? How is the sense of conclusion achieved? How are discrete sections contrasted? Which musical elements originate in the Western tradition, and which elements have roots in the Oriental sensibility? Art songs by a Japanese composer Yoshinao Nakada (1923–2000) were especially useful, since he incorporated the tonal, late-Romantic, and impressionistic idioms in a fairly straightforward fashion to delineate sections, while often utilizing the Japanese scales as pitch resources. As an ongoing project, I am also investigating music by Tōru Takemitsu, Takashi Yoshimatsu, Fumio Hayasaka, Isang Yun, and Chinary Ung to be included in this class.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Dancing into Diversity: Music Theory and Dance Analysis</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kara Yoo Leaman (Yale University)</p>

<p>Dance-related topics remain on the fringe of academic music theory, even though dance and music have shared an inseparable bond throughout much of world history. As our discipline broadens its scope to include interactions of the body with music, there has been increased interest in the relationship of music with dance. In this paper, I argue that music theorists are ideally situated to pursue choreomusical research; then, I present a music-based notation and methodology that can be adapted to accommodate the analysis of various dance styles; finally, I demonstrate with examples of minuet, ballet, salsa, and techno, how our discipline may continue to dance into diversity.</p>
<p>Choreomusical research has been stymied by political and technical barriers in two academic disciplines. With rare exceptions, dance researchers favor cultural-studies methods and lack musical training, while musicologists tend to focus on music composed with dancing in mind, rather than music with actual dancing. Taking advantage of film and internet resources and simplified movement descriptions, theorists are now in a position to apply their training to the explication of choreomusical works.</p>
<p>To that end, I present a music-based dance notation that visually aligns dance and music on the “choreomusical score.” The score’s simple movement descriptions require no specialized dance vocabulary, and it helps researchers to perceive relationships across media and across time. The sample analyses demonstrate that theorists can adapt the score to visualize nuanced choreomusical relationships, including analogy, variation, imitation, and metrical dissonance, in their repertoire of choice.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Analyzing Phenomenological Relationality or Music Theory Now</p>

<p>The analysis of the hybrid form of “intercultural modernism” (modernist music that incorporates non-Western elements) is now an established albeit still relatively minor thread of music theory. Typically, analysts approach the music by focusing on the meeting of Western and non-Western musical systems, tunings, timbres, aesthetics, and philosophies. One way of summarizing Yayoi Uno Everett’s “taxonomy” of intercultural modernism (in <i>Locating East Asia in Western Art Music</i>) would be: a) inauthentic impressions (“transference”), b) authentic knowledge (“syncretism”), and c) abstraction and translation (“synthesis”) of non-Western culture, musical or otherwise; all of these categories are premised on the presence of two distinct musical cultures. This bi-musical premise affords a plurality of cultural perspectives that is the cornerstone of identity politics. However, the bi-musical approach can also reinforce the idea that there will always be two distinct musical systems—this in a musical genre that is the most fertile ground for blurring cultural distinctions that are fading at an accelerating rate in our contemporary global ecumene. Simply put, the assumption of distinct musical systems is outmoded and fails to capture contemporary global reality. A proper music theory of the global era must be able to account for the new reality of cosmopolitan <i>in</i>distinction, in which the radical plurality of potential cultural affiliations obviates conventional assignations of cultural identity. Using aspects of phenomenology, I explore the <i>experience</i> of bi-musicality in terms of affiliation, affinity, and proximity to different musics, expressing this conceptual apparatus in terms of musical segments. The analysis of experience affords a handle on the nature of the fluctuating process of intercultural <i>relationality</i>, which, as a category of the “in-between,” goes beyond the identification of musical traits that belong to one or another culture.</p>
