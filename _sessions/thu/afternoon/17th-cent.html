<p class="abs-title">Counterpoint Models as a Topic of Invention in the Instrumental Music of Orlando Gibbons</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jonathan Oddie (Magdalen College, University of Oxford)</p>

<p>Early seventeenth-century music is difficult to theorize, sharing features with both sixteenth-century polyphony and emerging harmonic tonality, yet conforming to neither set of norms. This problem is particularly acute for English music, which occupies a marginal place in historical accounts centered on contemporary innovations such as figured bass and monody.</p>
<p>Focusing on instrumental music by Orlando Gibbons (1583–1625), this paper proposes that counterpoint models defined by small sets of melodic intervals provide a useful analytical tool for music of this period. These models or patterns originate in the teaching of two-part canon, and represent pre-existing forms for the construction of passages of stretto imitation. Gibbons’s music in particular is unusual in its thematic concentration on these common and minimal materials. Counterpoint models function in this repertoire as a rhetorical “topic of invention” which generates both imitative and chordal passages. In the latter context, counterpoint models function as a seventeenth-century analogue of chord progressions in later practice, and an analysis sensitive to them can reveal the underlying logic of passages which seem arbitrary from a harmonically tonal point of view.</p>
<p>Counterpoint models have connections to both earlier and later styles. Other authors have argued that the thematic use of these models is significant for the emergence of the Baroque style, and persists via the <i>partimento</i> tradition into the Galant style of the eighteenth century. These connections suggest the need to re-evaluate the relationship of English music to the mainstream of seventeenth-century music history.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Cognition in Scottish Common Sense Music Theory 1770–1800</p>
<p class="abs-author">Carmel Raz (Columbia University)</p>

<p>Scottish Enlightenment music theory constitutes a distinct theoretical tradition intent on applying insights on perception derived from Thomas Reid’s Common Sense philosophy toward solving problems of rhythm, harmony, and tuning. Scottish theorists including John Holden (1735–1771), Walter Young (1745–1814), and Thomas Robertson (died 1799) were unique for assigning agency to the faculties of memory and attention in determining perceived sounds and rhythms. Building music-theoretical systems governed by an innate cognitive preference for “isochronous parcels,” they came to innovative conclusions about the nature of music perception. Their findings within the domain of rhythm alone include a proposed temporal limit on entrainment at two seconds, the phenomenon of subjective rhythmization, and the cognitive strategy of chunking. </p>
<p>In closely reading the work of these Scottish theorists, my goal is to contribute to the growing awareness of the diversity of eighteenth-century rhythmic theorizing. Interpreting their account of cognitive strategies through Reid’s model of active perception, I argue that their ideas shed light on the relationship between music theories and philosophical constructions of the subject. Comparing Scottish music theory with aesthetic works by Avison, Webb, Twining, and others, I propose that these different modes of engaging with music are determined by Common Sense and Associationist philosophy, respectively. The remarkable similarities between Scottish Common Sense music theory and a number of principles espoused by contemporary music theory and cognition can thus serve to further our understanding of continuities and ruptures in techniques of listening within Western Classical repertoires.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Origin of Modern Combinatorics in 17th-Century Music Theory Treatises</p>
<p class="abs-author">John McKay (University of South Carolina)</p>

<p>Histories of mathematics generally locate the beginning of modern probability theory in Jakob Bernoulli’s <i>Ars conjectandi</i> (1713), which summarized many findings in combinatorics and probability discovered in the preceding centuries. Thus it is not surprising that histories of music have tended to focus on combinatorial music as an invention of the eighteenth century, particularly in the so-called “dice games” of Mozart, C.P.E. Bach, and others. Considering the interest surrounding the <i>ars combinatoria</i> and modern applications of combinatorics in music theory, little attention has been paid to the “pre-history” of mathematical combinatorics, which was first developed extensively in music theory treatises of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>This presentation will trace the path by which the <i>ars combinatoria</i> was first applied to music and subsequently laid the foundations of modern mathematical combinatorics. A sixteenth-century revival of interest in the medieval treatises of Ramon Llull along with problems posed by Christopher Clavius led to increasing combinatorial experiments. Marin Mersenne was inspired in his <i>Harmonie universelle</i> (1636) to tackle the problem of finding the best of all possible songs, an exercise which began with the enumeration of all 720 permutations of the hexachord. While Mersenne developed increasingly abstract numerical methods for computing permutations and combinations, Athanasius Kircher’s <i>Musurgia universalis</i> (1650) presented Mersenne’s complex mathematics in the form of numerous musical examples, ultimately seeking a practical method for generating musical compositions through combinations. Such ideas derived from music theory treatises influenced Leibniz and other later mathematicians who are generally credited with the development of combinatorial theory. </p>


<p class="abs-title">Triadic Counterpoint or Contrapuntal Triads: Compositional Pedagogy in Early Seventeenth-Century Germany</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benjamin Dobbs (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>In <i>Disputatio musica tertia</i> (1610) and <i>Synopsis musicae novae</i> (1612), Johannes Lippius offered a method for teaching composition from the bass using triads. This approach was revolutionary for several reasons: (1) a focus on homophony, (2) the identification of the bass as the “fundamental melody,” (3) the use of triads to structure verticalities, and (4) an integration of triadic theory and contrapuntal practice. Two decades later Heinrich Baryphonus and Heinrich Grimm were among the first writers to adopt Lippius’s triadic approach, doing so in the second edition of their didactic treatise, <i>Pleiades musicae</i> (1630). Despite abundant similarities between these texts, subtle differences in methodology emerge. On the one hand, Lippius viewed the triad as an <i>a priori</i> compositional guide to which counterpoint served a supporting role. On the other hand, in Baryphonus and Grimm’s model, triads arose from counterpoint. </p>
<p>In this presentation, I build upon Benito Rivera’s investigations into the development of triadic and harmonic theory in Germany in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. I place Lippius into the context of his intellectual predecessors, Johannes Avianus and Joachim Burmeister. I then compare the pedagogical approaches of <i>Synopsis musicae novae</i> and <i>Pleiades musicae</i>, teasing out minute, yet pivotal variations that reveal Baryphonus and Grimm’s fundamentally divergent orientation to composition from that of Lippius. In doing so, I explore contrasting pedagogies for musical composition in early seventeenth-century Germany, and I highlight two possible methods for reconciling the established field of counterpoint with an emerging theory of harmony.</p>
