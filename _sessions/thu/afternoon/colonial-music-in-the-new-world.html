<p class="abs-title">Pedro de Gante and the Creation of Euro-Mexica Catholic Song in Sixteenth-Century New Spain</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lorenzo Candelaria (University of Texas at El Paso)</p>

<p>This paper addresses the foundational work of Fray Pedro de Gante, a missionary of the Franciscan Order who moved from his native Belgium to the central valley of Mexico in 1523, and became the first dedicated teacher of European music in the Americas. At the heart of this narrative is Fray Pedro’s “Indian chapel” of San José de los Naturales (built in what is now Mexico City) which served not only as a devotional/catechetical space for local Mexica communities (better known as “the Aztecs”) but also as a vocational school specializing in music, art, and writing. The effective methods of evangelization developed at San José, along with the chapel’s distinctive outdoor architecture, were replicated as far south as Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula and as far north as modern-day New Mexico (U.S.) well into the eighteenth century. The greatest musical legacy of San José, examined here, is the cultivation of the Christianized areíto—a paraliturgical song and dance ceremony that merged the Mexica’s sacred music traditions with European-Catholic doctrinal instruction.</p>
<p>The remarkable story of San José de los Naturales has yet to receive its due attention in our musicological literature. This paper recounts its origins and subsequent development under Pedro de Gante then focuses on a seminal moment that (in de Gante’s view) altered the course of Catholic evangelization in New Spain—the first staging of a Christianized <em>areíto</em> in the courtyard of San José on 25 December 1527. De Gante thenceforth regarded the areíto as a definitive solution to significant communication problems that had initially hampered his evangelical efforts with a broad swath of the Mexica population. But contemporary writers and church edicts describe a far more complicated process through which European Catholics increasingly sought to attenuate the Mexica’s cultural traditions within this hybrid genre of Euro-Mexica Catholic song. In foregrounding the tensions that accompanied the development of a culturally blended form of religious music, this discussion also sheds light on the central (and often complex) role that music assumed in the absence of a common spoken language between European colonizers and the indigenous people they encountered in sixteenth-century New Spain.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Mozart and the Moravians</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sarah Eyerly (Florida State University)</p>

<p>Beginning in the 1730s, members of the German-Moravian church established mission communities across the Atlantic world. From Pennsylvania, New York, and North Carolina, to St. Thomas, Suriname, and the West African coast, Moravians carried with them their unique form of evangelical Christianity and, perhaps most importantly, the cultural traditions of the German-speaking world, including vocal and instrumental art music. Through a sophisticated network of port facilities on each side of the Atlantic, as well as privately owned transport ships, including the <em>SS Harmony</em> and <em>SS Irene</em>, Moravians imported the latest musical manuscripts, instruments, and European-trained composers and musicians to the far reaches of the Atlantic world.</p>
<p>A significant number of pieces imported by the Moravians were newly created <em>contrafacta</em> of popular works by well-known composers such as Haydn, Mozart, and Graun. For instance, late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century archival records from Moravian communities demonstrate that the Moravians were adapting and re-texting scenes from Mozart’s operas within ten years of their premieres. This paper will explore the ways that Mozart’s works were circulated, adapted, and performed in Moravian communities. For what purposes and in what contexts did the Moravians repurpose scenes from <em>Così fan tutte</em> (“Secondate, aurette amiche/Deinem Heiland, Zion preise”) and <em>Die Zauberflöte</em> (“Bei Männern, welche Liebe fühlen/Schallt unsere Dankes frohe Lieder”)? What kinds of inter-textual and inter-musical meanings can be gleaned from <em>contrafacta</em> of sacred works such as “Ave verum corpus”? Who heard and performed these works in mission communities, such as the Mohican and Delaware communities of Shekomeko, Gnadenhütten, and Pachgatgoch? What inter-cultural or cross-cultural meanings did Mozart <em>contrafacta</em> have for German-born Moravians, as well as native musicians and audiences? What can these <em>contrafacta</em> teach us about the transatlantic reception and performance of Mozart’s works in general?</p>
<p>For the Moravians, transference of music and instruments to each mission community allowed missionaries and native-born congregants alike to experience the musical culture of the German-speaking world even on the peripheries of the West Indies, the coast of North Africa, or the wild-lands of Pennsylvania. In the words of one Moravian source, congregants were to feel “everywhere at Home.”</p>


<p class="abs-title">Mothers, Sisters, <em>Niñas</em>, and Nuns: The Professional Training of Young Female Musicians of Colonial Mexico</p>
<p class="abs-author">Faith S. Lanam (University of California, Santa Cruz)</p>

<p><em>El Colegio de San Miguel de Belem</em> was home to the first female music conservatory in Mexico. Predominantly employing male music teachers from Mexico City’s Metropolitan Cathedral, Belem’s <em>escoleta de música,</em> founded in the mid-1700s, taught girls voice, organ, harpsichord, strings, and winds. While most alumnae of the <em>escoleta</em> either married or professed as nuns, two graduates, María Micaela and María Joaquina Jerusalem, daughters of the cathedral’s <em>maestro de capilla</em> Ignacio Jerusalem, became music teachers at <em>El Colegio de San Ignacio de Loyola, Vizcaínas</em> and the convent <em>La Encarnación</em>. This paper addresses several crucial questions: What musical pedagogy was applied at Belem? What styles and difficulty of music were performed? How did the students’ musical education contribute to their development and shape their adult lives?</p>
<p>My research draws on my editions of primary sources in <em>el Archivo Historico del Colegio de San Ignacio de Loyola, Vizcaínas</em> and secondary sources in historical musicology, music education, and colonialism and gender studies. Various pieces intended for performance in Belem’s chapel services demonstrate the girls’ musical skill level, and three unique didactic manuscripts—“Vezerro de lecciones” containing music by Francesco Feo, Leonardo Leo, and Ignacio Jerusalem; “Livro de Lelciones [sic] a Solo Violin” by Nicolas Olivari; and the anonymous “Manuscrito J.M.J”—illustrate pedagogy employed at Belem. My paper enhances our understanding of historically underrepresented foci in musicology, specifically eighteenth-century music pedagogy and the professional training of female musicians, situated within the greater context of the musical and social life of colonial Mexico City. Belem’s students performed music composed both in Mexico and Europe, trained with teachers from the cathedral, professed as nuns in the city’s convents, and became vital members of Mexico City’s society. <em>La escoleta</em> was not an isolated island, but rather a female institution with strong ties to the world outside its walls and an active contributor to the musical life of Mexico’s capital. Belem employed a sophisticated curriculum that empowered eighteenth- and nineteenth-century women to become not just wives and mothers, but also accomplished nuns and teachers who increased their independence and autonomy by using the musical skills learned at Belem.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Globalization of Instrumental Music in the Late Eighteenth Century: Reception and Transmission of the Galant-Classical Repertory in Lima, Peru (c. 1770–c. 1800)</p>

<p>It is a known fact—recently confirmed by Richard Wetzel—that, by the end of the eighteenth century, European instrumental music had attained a far-reaching level of dissemination around the globe.</p>
<p>In the case of Latin America, previous studies by Robert Stevenson, John Koegel, and Ricardo Miranda, among others, confirm the arrival of pieces by Joseph Haydn and his contemporaries starting in the 1780s. However, barring a few exceptions, the information provided by these scholars has been focused mainly on Mexico City (for example, José Fernández de Jáuregui’s gigantic collection of music, which, around 1801, included works by the most renowned European composers of the eighteenth century, was located there). For the rest of Latin America, and particularly Lima—the other major capital of the viceregal period—information is extremely scarce, found primarily in the studies by Andrés Sas and Juan Carlos Estenssoro. This lack of information can explain why a recently published book stated that “the dissemination and consumption of symphonic and chamber music in Latin America” began in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The present study—which expands the author’s recent publications—seeks to show that: 1) music by composers such as Johann Christian Bach, Luigi Boccherini, and Haydn was systematically imported in Lima in the late eighteenth century, as well as the instruments necessary to play such music; 2) while some of the music and instruments were meant for professional and amateur musicians in Lima, they were also sent to different cities in the Viceroyalty of Peru, which made Lima into a regional hub for their reception and circulation; and 3) both the music and instruments in question were mainly destined for private settings. In order to demonstrate this, documents from the <em>Archivo General de la Nación del Peru</em>, as well as a manuscript for a keyboard instrument preserved in the San Francisco Convent in Lima, will be examined.</p>
<p>This study thus aims to expand on current knowledge about both the musical life of viceregal Spanish America, and the global dissemination attained by the galant-classical repertory originating in Europe.</p>
