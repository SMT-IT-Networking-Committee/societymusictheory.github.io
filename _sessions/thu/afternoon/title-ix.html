<p>This workshop presents a comprehensive overview of Title IX and how it
applies to instructors and their role in higher education. We will discuss
mandatory reporting duties for employees and strategies for prevention,
intervention, and support around Title IX-related incidents. Interactive case
scenarios will help us to apply this knowledge to situations we may face in
the workplace and classroom.</p>
