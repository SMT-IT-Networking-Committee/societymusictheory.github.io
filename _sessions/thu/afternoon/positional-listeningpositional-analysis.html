<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>As analysts, we typically approach a piece of music from the conductor’s (classical) or producer’s (pop) point of view, attending to the entire texture and attempting to keep it all in our ear, even while we are simultaneously focusing on certain specific elements. There are certainly textures that challenge our ability to hear everything, such as complex orchestral scores or intricate contrapuntal pieces. But even in such cases, we still <em>strive</em> to hear all parts, and this helps define the Ideal Listening Position as a kind of balanced, objective, or even distanced view of the complete texture.</p>
<p>But what happens to this Ideal Listening Position for a musician playing inside a texture? How might one’s experience of and focus within the music provide a different perspective? If it does differ, what factors account for this? Is such a listening position a negative one—a kind of pragmatic practice required by performance but one that ultimately distorts the music—or does it offer fresh insight, a new way of hearing that enriches and augments our experience and understanding?</p>
<p>To explore these issues, this session will focus mostly on pop music. Four speakers will explore “positional listening/positional analysis” from distinct positions inside of the standard rock combo. This ninety-minute session will feature four fifteen-minute talks, followed by a ten-minute response and ending with twenty minutes for questions and discussion.</p>

<p class="abs-title">A View from Guitar Land: Shifting Positional Listening in Complex Textures</p>
<p class="abs-author">John Covach (University of Rochester)</p>

<p>Positional listening might seem to imply that a performer focuses in a particular way throughout an entire piece, and in many instances this may indeed be so. But in complex textures that change in significant ways from section to section, a performer’s listening position may shift as a consequence of such changes. This may result in a series of listening positions that are driven by performance concerns, and that are often distinct from the Ideal Listening Position (ILP). Positional shifting may occur between contiguous sections, as well as between a specific section and its varied return. In order to explore this type of positioning experience as directed by live performance (on stage or in the studio), this paper will examine 1970s progressive rock and jazz-rock fusion from the guitarist’s perspective, drawing examples from the music of Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Stratified Keyboard Harmony in the Music of Todd Rundgren</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kevin Holm-Hudson (University of Kentucky)</p>

<p>Playing keyboards produces awareness of a potential “right-left split” in harmony. In keyboard playing both hands are free to provide notes or chords, and they may work independently of one another. Musicians as diverse as Tony Banks of Genesis and Igor Stravinsky have commented on the “happy accidents” in harmony when one hand plays a “wrong” note. It is therefore not surprising that the harmonic language of songs composed at the keyboard would be different from that of those composed on guitar.</p>
<p>The music of Todd Rundgren is ideal for comparing differences in guitar-based and keyboard-based songwriting approaches. Rundgren is equally fluent on guitar and keyboard; while his guitar-based compositions are more riff-based and use parallel chord structures, his keyboard-based compositions are much more nuanced, displaying a distinctive multi-tiered harmonic language.</p>
<p>I propose a three-tier structure to Rundgren’s use of harmony. Tier 1 presents ordinary triads and seventh chords (e.g., C major). Tier 2 introduces the right-left split, so that for example, while the left hand plays C, the right hand plays the V of C (e.g., G/C). Tier 3 extends the dominant “fissure” found in Tier 2 to a secondary level, e.g., D/C (where the “V of V” of C is superimposed upon the C). While these chords may be described by conventional means, Rundgren’s music is not bound by traditional harmonic function or jazz-derived voice leading.</p>
<p>I demonstrate the interrelationship of these three harmonic levels through a close study of Rundgren’s “Don’t You Ever Learn” (1974).</p>


<p class="abs-title">Metric Levels from Behind the Kit (and Elsewhere)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Brad Osborn (University of Kansas)</p>

<p>Long considered the rhythmic backbone of the group, the drummer often has less flexibility in metric interpretation than other players. Because of standard rock drumming practice, which entails playing the fastest subdivision on the hi-hat or ride cymbal, drummers are virtually <em>forced</em> then to entrain with the fastest metric level available. This is unnecessary for players providing melodic or harmonic layers (e.g. a singer or a keyboardist comping slow chords, respectively).</p>
<p>Two kinds of groove highlight this discrepancy in metric levels. First, in maximally even grooves, musicians can either entrain to evenly spaced subdivisions (e.g., 8 eighth notes) or to the slower uneven beats (e.g., 3+3+2). Second, grooves involving odd-cardinality meters at certain tempi (e.g. 5/4 with quarter note ~180BPM) offer three viable metric levels following London’s (2012) tempo constraints on tactus: a) two slow, uneven beats per bar (3+2); b) four faster uneven beats (3+3+2+2); and c) five even quarters (2+2+2+2+2).</p>
<p>In this presentation, I will illustrate several examples of these two groove types using dot-notation to show the different metric levels available to different members of the ensemble. In both of these groove-types, the drummer’s fastest subdivision evenly divides any possible slower levels added by other members. The drummer’s entrainment to this fastest shared metric level then acts as an anchor, allowing the rest of the ensemble’s timing discrepancies to shape the groove at slower metric levels.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Attentional Cost and Positional Analysis: A Bassist’s Perspective</p>
<p class="abs-author">Gregory R. McCandless (Appalachian State University)</p>

<p>As popular music tends not to be notated, its analysis often occupies the esthesic level (following Nattiez 1990), proceeding from perception to transcriptions and discussions of musical phenomena that require a distanced view of the ensemble (e.g., resultant meters from the combination of rhythmic layers, vertical harmonies, formal divisions, etc.). However, the esthesic vantage point can be distanced from that of a performer producing music in the moment, as the performer cannot realistically concentrate on the real-time creation of his/her part while simultaneously attending to those created by every other member of the ensemble in many circumstances.</p>
<p>For the bassist in pop/rock ensembles, however, poietic and esthesic “poles” may converge due to a variety of factors that carry a low level of attentional cost. In this presentation, I enumerate the determinants of attentional cost for bassists, using transcriptions that reflect a broad spectrum of performance difficulty. High performance difficulty tends to correspond with high attentional cost, and is related to a poietic/esthesic divide that may make ensemble analyses experientially distant for performers. The extremely high attentional cost of improvisation, for example, creates a significant poietic/esthesic divide for jazz bassists, in particular, as well as for jazz performers more generally. Low difficulty/attentional cost is, on the other hand, related to a poietic/esthesic fusion wherein the performer and listener share a similar analytical position, rendering ensemble analyses more experientially resonant. I conclude the presentation by considering the implications of attentional cost theory on analytical strategies in jazz and other popular genres.</p>
