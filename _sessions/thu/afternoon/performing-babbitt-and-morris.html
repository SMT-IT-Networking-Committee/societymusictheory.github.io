<p class="abs-title">Babbitt’s Gestural Dialectics</p>
<p class="abs-author">Zachary Bernstein (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>The precompositional array structures of Babbitt’s music, which present twelve-tone series fixed in narrow registers, seem static and impersonal. Nevertheless, numerous commentators on Babbitt’s music, including Mead, Dubiel, Sandow, Boretz, and Leong and McNutt have celebrated the sense of motion the music inspires, describing it in vividly gestural terms. This paper will explore the dialectical tension between the music’s static precompositional structures and the dynamic surfaces these authors experience. The static precursor is posited as a field from which the dynamic realization may emerge or against which the dynamic realization may struggle. Gestural sensation is investigated in light of research by Hatten, Mead, Cox, Kozak, London, McCreless, and Monahan and BaileyShea.</p>
<p>An exploration of gestural dialectics sheds light on four topics to be discussed in the paper: the all-partition array, Babbitt’s primary contrapuntal device after 1965, whose partitional variety facilitates gestural experimentation; Babbitt’s later practice of creating small-scale periodicity by filling in time-point intervals with strings of even note values and medium-scale periodicity by frequently repeating time points; text-setting; and serial anomalies—deviations from array expectations—which occasionally seem to be motivated by gestural considerations. In several examples to be discussed, gesturally motivated anomalies are used to effect a sense of closing rhetoric.</p>
<p>Babbitt’s music creates gestures in an environment that seems hostile to embodied energetics. As Peles says of Schoenberg, Babbitt “give[s] a body to something that in its native form has none.”</p>

<p>This presentation combines an analysis and performance of Robert Morris’s <em>Scraps</em> (1997)<em>,</em> a twelve-tone composition for solo piano. First I examine the large-scale form, highlight several properties of the source row, and explore the essential characteristics of the different types of all-partition arrays that comprise the work’s seven distinct sections. I then outline my interpretation, or “take,” and address issues of gesture, pedaling, tempo, rubato, harmonic rhythm, polyphony, and energy flow. I conclude with a performance of the eleven-minute work.</p>
<p>The analysis places particular attention to gestures, hexachords, and aggregate rhythm, and looks closely at three aspects of the surface realizations of the arrays: (1) harmonic consistency, as the pitch-class materials are entirely based on six pairs of hexachords, all of which are segments of the source row; (2) a specific kind of repetition called <em>recontextualization</em> (after Hanninen 2012), where entire array portions are restated, but in radically different contexts; and (3) trichordal derivation, which comes to the fore in the penultimate section, an extended and virtuosic cadenza that marks the dynamic, textural, and rhetorical climax.</p>
