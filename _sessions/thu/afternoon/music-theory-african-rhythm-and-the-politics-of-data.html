<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>When new types and formats of empirically-driven music analysis and theory began to appear in the 1980s, they focused on Western repertoires. Their methodologies included (a) studies of timing data from audio recordings or MIDI instrument performances, (b) experimental tests of listeners’ perception and cognition, and (c) computational analyses and modeling based on large audio or symbolic corpuses. These methodologies have had little application to other musics, primarily due to logistical and political circumstances.</p>
<p>As a model and a corrective, in this special session, we present three statistical analyses of a corpus of of Malian percussion music. These analyses will consider (a) rhythm-meter relationships, (b) the metricality of swing-timings, and (c) ensemble synchronization and entrainment in three different pieces (<em>Maraka</em>, <em>Manjanin</em>, and <em>Woloso</em>), using data collected in Bamako (Mali) in 2006 and 2007. As a corpus of audio-based timing-data it has high ecologically validity, with analyses based on real audio as opposed to symbolic representations. The high temporal resolution (on the order of 1ms) of our timing data allows us to approach questions of ensemble timing with a degree of precision that is rare even in timing studies of Western music. Third, it applies powerful computational tools (e.g., the Grainger Causality method of time-series analysis) to musical contexts and analytical problems.</p>

<p>In a seminal paper Palmer &amp; Krumhansl (1990) tallied the metrical distribution of note onsets in an ad-hoc corpus of classic and romantic piano music; there they found strong correlations between onset distributions and normative patterns of metrical structure and accent. They then suggested that statistical learning—that is, the passive exposure to a sufficient amount of repertoire—could play a significant role in the acquisition of our knowledge of meter and metrical accent. Huron &amp; Ommen’s 2006 corpus study of American popular music gave additional support for Palmer &amp; Krumhansl’s claim, and an analogous presumption regarding the association between statistical likelihood and metrical prominence is embraced by Temperley (2010), most explicitly in his account of syncopation.</p>
<p>Here we present an analysis of the metrical distribution of ~40,000 rhythmic onsets in a corpus of Malian jembe music. In this corpus the underlying metrical structure cannot be directly inferred from the statistical distribution of its onset patterns, as this music is characterized by “contrametric” rhythms (Kolinski 1973). The broader implications of this non-congruence between statistical likelihood and metrical accent for both rhythmic theory and analysis, as well as statistical learning approaches for musical meter are discussed, and a modified form of statistical learning, supplemented by additional musical and extra-musical information, is proposed.</p>

<p>Most approaches to musical rhythm in music theory presume that musical rhythms are based on isochronous (temporally equidistant) beats and/or beat subdivisions. However, rhythms that are based on non-isochronous, or unequal patterns of time are prominent in music from around the globe (for instance, in Scandinavia, Balkany, the Near East, Southern Asia, West Africa, the Maghreb, and the African diasporas). The present study examines one such style found in contemporary Malian jembe drum ensemble music.</p>
<p>A corpus of fifteen representative performances of three different pieces containing ~43,000 data points was chronometrically analyzed. Two different patterns of subdivision are evident, one non-isochronous (short-long-long, pieces “Woloso” and “Manjanin”), another one quasi-isochronous (piece “Maraka”). These timing profiles are stable under significant tempo changes and across ensemble parts and sizes, players, and recordings.</p>
<p>The average extent and variability of asynchronies in all three pieces is extremely small. The extent of mean signed asynchrony among ensemble members (phase-shift) is not significantly different between the pieces; a two-way Piece × Instrument ANOVA did not show any significant main effect (piece: F(2,34)=0.59,9 p=0.55). Standard deviations of the asynchronies in isochronous Maraka and non-isochronous Woloso (SLL) do not significantly differ from each other (t(31)= 0.96, p=n.s). We conclude that precision and stability of rhythm and ensemble entrainment in human music does not necessarily depend on metric isochrony. Rather than a biologically-based constraint, isochrony may represent a historically popular option within a variety of culturally contingent options for metric organization.</p>

<p>How do small music ensembles keep in time together, across tempo shifts and despite human timing errors? A popular assumption is that leadership is organized by musical role, e.g., the first violin in string quartets. Malian drum ensembles involve three distinct musical roles: a variative lead drum, a repertoire-specific timeline, and one or two ostinato accompaniment parts. Timing data for ~190,000 note onsets were extracted from two dedicated multi-track audio corpuses. Two different statistical approaches, linear phase correction modeling and Grainger Causality, yielded similar findings on the timing influences between individual players, indicative of the process of ensemble entrainment.</p>
<p>In corpus 1 the lead drum plays slightly ahead of the ensemble (negative phase-shift), but nonetheless adapts to the timeline and accompaniment parts to a much larger extent than vice-versa. The delegation of time-keeping and other aspects of musical pacing to other instruments allows the lead-drum to focus on other tasks (virtuosic playing, interactions with audiences, singers, and dancers, etc.). Additionally, the traditional Africanist concept of the timeline as the central timing reference is modified, as our data show that the accompaniment and timeline parts are jointly responsible for keeping time.</p>
<p>In corpus 2, systematic role-switching amongst ensemble members allowed us to isolate interactions between individuals’ personal playing styles and role-driven behavior. We found the same role-driven behavior as with corpus 1: while some lead-drum players reverse the pattern of phase-shift (playing ahead vs. laid-back), they do not override the broader role-based patterns of entrainment amongst ensemble members.</p>
