  <p>Recent developments in the geometrical theory of voice leading and algebraic scale theory can illuminate the old and enduring debate between <i>Stufentheorie </i>and <i>Funktionstheorie</i>. In this paper we bring two mathematical approaches into analytical dialogue: one based on <i>quantized voice leadings, </i>the other on the <i>word-theoretic study of modes</i>. These approaches have their roots in two well-known scale-theoretic characterizations of the diatonic: <i>maximal evenness</i> and <i>well-formedness</i>.</p>
<p>In the voice-leading approach, equiheptatonic triads varying by small “microtranspositions” are rounded (“quantized”) to the nearest semitone values. The structural-modes approach reorganizes elements from Riemann’s function theory on the level of structural bass notes (fundamental bass). These reside in the modes of the structural scale and thereby obtain functional meanings. Different structural modes give different intervallic relations between the subdominant, dominant, and tonic (such as IV-V-I versus ii-V-I). </p>
<p>We illustrate both approaches with sample analyses of common-practice works, comparing the approaches by how they reflect semantic distinctions essential to the conventional narrative of the formal design. The voice-leading approach interacts more directly with elements of the musical surface, such as motions of structural voices, and directly reflects salient features of progressions such as strength, connectedness, sharpwardness/flatwardness, and direction. The word-theoretic approach more effectively distinguishes between tonal meanings of chords and can address aspects of both harmonic progression and chord voicing from a common model. The word-theoretic notion of “bad conjugates,” for example, explains the exceptional status of both the bVII chord as dominant and the 64 position.</p>

<p>Recognizing the qualia of musical events, such as scale-degree, is a critical component of musicianship. Scale-degree qualia is a subject that has been approached by theoretical, cognitive, and philosophical measures alike. The philosophical approach attempts to explore what it means for a musical object (in this case, scale-degree) to give rise to qualia, while the cognitive and theoretical approaches attempt to examine musical features and properties that might contribute to those qualia. In this paper I investigate this topic from all three vantage points, building on work from David Huron (2006), Carol Krumhansl (1979a; 1979b; 1983), and Benjamin Hansberry (2013). I will discuss the findings and significance of multiple studies that address the following questions: Is an individual’s experience of scale-degree qualia reliable and consistent? Does conscious, conceptual knowledge interfere with a phenomenological experience, and what role does musical training play in the shaping of that phenomenal content? And lastly, how does the quale of a scale-degree change in different harmonic contexts?</p>
    <p>This investigation of scale-degree qualia begins with a corpus analysis in which the probabilities for scale-degree continuations are evaluated in various harmonic settings. The results of the corpus analysis formed the basis for a perceptual study, in which listeners with and without musical training were asked to evaluate the qualia of scale-degrees in different musical contexts. The findings and implications from this study are discussed in relation to the existing qualia literature.</p>
