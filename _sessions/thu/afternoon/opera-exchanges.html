<p class="abs-title">The Poet’s Prose: <em>Dramma per musica</em> after “Télémacomania”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Katharina Clausius (University of Cambridge)</p>

<p>Even before François Fénelon’s epic novel <em>Les Aventures de Télémaque</em> first appeared in 1699, its author was exiled and the book banned by papal decree. Within five years, however, notoriety had given way to renown, and France was gripped by a “Télémacomania” that persisted into the late eighteenth century: by 1705, Fénelon’s novel had appeared in at least twenty editions, been adapted as a tragic drama by two prominent French playwrights, and presented on the operatic stage by Danchet and Campra.</p>
<p>My paper situates the “Télémacomania” phenomenon at the centre of a crucial exchange between a French revisionist movement to redefine neoclassical theatre and Italian <em>dramma per musica</em> in the second half of the eighteenth century. Literary scholarship, familiar with the heated paper war incited by Fénelon’s novel thanks to Fabienne Moore and Romira Worville’s research, has so far paid little heed to the eighteenth-century operatic stage as the most prominent and sustained reworking of the neoclassical tragic tradition. While Antoine Houdar de la Motte and Voltaire argued publically over the theoretical viability of prose tragedy on the back of <em>Télémaque</em>, the operatic stage was already actively absorbing and experimenting with principles of de la Motte’s new brand of theatre: a looser approach to versification, a less compounded application of the Aristotelian unities (of time, place, and action), and a bolder approach to character portrayal.</p>
<p>I rely on two case studies to argue that <em>dramma per musica</em> began to adopt specific principles of de la Motte’s contentious “prose tragedy” genre: Vittorio Amedeo Cigna-Santi’s <em>Mitridate</em> libretto (set by Quirino Gasparini in 1767 and Mozart in 1770), which was based on the same Racine play that incited de la Motte and Voltaire’s animosity; and Giambattista Varesco’s <em>Idomeneo</em>, based on Danchet’s direct adaptation of Fénelon.</p>
<p>This paper takes up Reinhard Strohm’s challenge to synthesize literary and musicological approaches towards a cross-disciplinary poetics of Enlightenment opera. I extend the scope of Strohm’s research to show that <em>dramma per musica</em> inherits a neoclassical tradition in flux, its composers and librettists actively directing the century’s noisiest revisionist movement through opera’s own theatrical praxis.</p>

<p class="abs-title"><em>Fra le quinte</em> with Aida: Teresa Stolz Writes to Giuseppe Verdi</p>
<p class="abs-author">Caroline Anne Ellsmore (Melbourne)</p>

<p>Teresa Stolz was Giuseppe Verdi’s first Aida for La Scala and may have been the third serious love of his life. While being accorded respect for her prowess as a great Verdian singer, Stolz has also been rather slightingly dismissed by some writers such as Frank Walker, Umberto Zoppi, and even Julian Budden, as little more than the somewhat vapid, unintelligent, and grasping diva who abandoned her fiancé, the conductor Angelo Mariani, and threatened Verdi’s marriage to Giuseppina Strepponi. Yet Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, without further elaboration, referred to Stolz as “one of Verdi’s main lifelines to the theatre for years.” The correspondence between Stolz and Verdi reveals her to have been of substantial value to him and to us.</p>
<p>Close examination of selected letters from Stolz to Verdi, and comparison of these with operatic reviews from various contemporary sources, allow us to measure Stolz’s evaluations and personal accounts of musical theatre. Her assessments of her own and others’ performances reassured Verdi of the rapturous reception of his operas and the <em>Messa da Requiem</em>, and of his having little serious competition from younger composers. She flattered and bolstered the sense of self-worth of this eminent but aging man, who knew that he had only a short time left as an active and relevant artist. In doing so, with the immediacy of her sometimes amusing and often succinctly candid opinions, however, she also revealed perspectives which broaden our knowledge of reception history.</p>
<p>The house journals of publishers like Ricordi promoted those composers whose work they published or the singers whose performances they favored, as a matter of policy. This paper examines how Stolz’s privately communicated views compare with the commercially constrained and uniformly effusive reviews of journals such as the <em>Gazzetta musicale di Milano</em>. By her letters, Stolz, the experienced and renowned artist, close to and trusted by Verdi for thirty years, functioned for him as a support in his later creative period and for us as a corrective to unquestioning reliance either on such contemporary journalism or on the opinions of twentieth-century biographers.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Reading at the Opera: The Case of Donizetti’s Historicism</p>
<p class="abs-author">Edward Jacobson (University of California, Berkeley)</p>

<p>Perusing Italian opera libretti printed in the first decades of the nineteenth century reveals two significant and interconnected trends: an increase in historical subjects and in para-textual material (such as librettists’ prefaces, historical introductions, extended scenic descriptions, anthropological footnotes, and even bibliographies). This proliferation of printed materials intended to be read—rather than enacted on stage—attests to the rising importance of reading as part of the <em>primo ottocento</em> opera-going experience. Not only were audiences looking at their printed libretti, which conditioned them to invest the operatic action with an aura of authenticity, but the characters on stage often modeled reading as a practice, guiding audiences toward a canon of Italian literary works. Given this emphasis on written history, in this paper I argue that reading during the opera was an indispensable element of Romantic operatic historicism.</p>
<p>I show how both the literary pretensions of <em>ottocento</em> librettists and the related phenomenon of reading in opera reveal the inextricable link between history and literature that has been stressed by critics of post-Napoleonic historical consciousness such as Hayden White and Lionel Gossman. These practices converge in Donizetti’s 1833 <em>Torquato Tasso</em>, a work for which the librettist, Jacopo Ferretti, provided an extended historical introduction containing a bibliography, references to archival documents, aspirations to “storica verità,” and quotes from Tasso himself. Combined with the opera’s dramatized reading of <em>Gerusalemme liberata</em>, such prefatory materials demonstrate the intermedial aspects of operatic historicism, one that necessarily invites audiences to supplement operatic spectacle with carefully curated history.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Analyzing Time Structures in Nineteenth-Century Opera</p>
<p class="abs-author">Laura Moeckli (University of Bern)</p>

<p>In his monumental study of time in Western culture, Robert Wendorff describes the contrasting impulses of nineteenth-century time-perception between increased linear acceleration and the inextricably connected urge to interrupt this linearity through moments of suspended time. Of course it has long been recognized that an essential feature of operatic composition lies in the alternation of “dynamic open” and “static closed” sections, but how temporal stasis, progression, and momentum are actually achieved in complex nineteenth-century opera recitatives has hitherto been largely neglected. Dahlhaus schematically describes the operatic dichotomy as an alternation of sections where “represented time” and “time of representation” advance at a similar pace (i.e. recitatives) and sections where “time of representation” is expanded into “rhapsodic temporal bubbles” vastly divergent from “represented time” (i.e. closed numbers). With the gradual shift away from closed-number operas towards through-composition, this dichotomy became increasingly blurred: on the one hand, “closed” numbers became more “open,” with bursts of “realist” time interrupting the lyrical bubbles; on the other hand, declamatory passages became increasingly varied in terms of temporal progression. It is this diversified treatment of time in nineteenth-century recitatives which will be the main focus here.</p>
<p>In this paper, I will present an original method for temporal analysis in opera which takes into account prosodic, compositional, dramaturgical, and performative aspects that contribute to the timing and pacing of recitatives, thereby aiming to better grasp the momentum and suspense that constitute the essence of dynamic dramaturgy. In addition, my approach relies on a metaphorical analogy with the domain of film studies, whereby terminology such as “montage,” “timing,” “pacing,” “sequences,” “take,” “cut,” and “flashback” is borrowed and used as an experimental tool. I will compare some of the most innovative declamatory passages by Rossini, Meyerbeer, and Wagner, examining how lyrical and periodically structured musical elements are increasingly woven into recitative-like frameworks, creating dynamic juxtapositions of movement and stasis in the build-up of through-composed scenes. I will discuss how the diversification of declamatory textures—from simple recitative to elaborate accompagnato and parlante—enabled a highly flexible treatment of dramatic time in nineteenth-century opera.</p>
