<p class="abs-title"><em>The Burning Fiery Furnace</em> and the Redemption of Religious Kitsch</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christopher Chowrimootoo (University of Notre Dame)</p>

<p>In this paper, I examine the background, production, and reception of <em>The Burning Fiery Furnace</em> (1966), Benjamin Britten’s second parable for church performance, for the light it sheds on mid-century tensions in the aesthetics of sacred music. As a first step, I will set the work against the backdrop of three interrelated contexts: modernist repudiations of religious kitsch; contemporary reforms within English liturgy; and Britten’s own polarized sacred output during this period, from the monumental drama of <em>War Requiem</em> (1962) to the austere minimalism of <em>Curlew River</em> (1964). I will then examine in detail how <em>The Burning Fiery Furnace</em> trod a fine line between reigning critical oppositions—between high and low liturgy, asceticism and aestheticism, mystical transcendence, and authoritarian sublime.</p>
<p>More specifically, I will explore how the <em>Furnace</em>’s minimalism and exoticism encouraged defenders to distance it from the demagogic associations of Anglo-Catholic tradition. The result of this critical selectiveness, I contend, was to fashion a form of sublimity and spirituality more compatible with the self-conscious modernism, rationalism, and liberalism of the mid-century middle classes. At the same time, I suggest that the work smuggled back in religious registers of a more explicitly sensuous and monumental nature, often in association with the gaudy rituals of the Babylonian King. Ultimately, however, I argue that the trouble critics had separating the two aesthetic modes—or even deciding which they found most compelling—bespeaks broader problems with the terms of discourse. By confounding the oppositions governing mid-century criticism and more recent historiographies alike, <em>The Burning Fiery Furnace</em> raises the possibility that even more straightforwardly modernist or ascetic sacred music could engage simultaneously with the powerful sublimity and sensuality of religious kitsch.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Antimodernism, Ultramodernism, and “After Modernism”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ryan Dohoney (Northwestern University)</p>

<p>Recent revisionist work on neoclassicism by Levitz, Fulcher, and Schloesser has shown the high degree to which the aesthetico-religious movement known as the <em>renouveau catholique</em> shaped cosmopolitan modernism in the first half of the twentieth century. Virtually unknown is the translation of the <em>renouveau</em> to the U.S. by prominent French patrons and its convergence with of the aesthetics of the New York School, particularly Morton Feldman and Mark Rothko.</p>
<p>In this paper I track the American afterlife of the <em>renouveau</em> to the unlikely locale of Houston. I focus on Morton Feldman’s 1967 residency at the University of St. Thomas held in conjunction with the exhibition “Six Painters,” co-curated by Feldman and French patron Dominique de Menil which featured paintings by Rothko, Guston, Mondrian et al. Mrs. de Menil’s <em>renouveau</em> aesthetics suffused the exhibition as well as Feldman’s lecture “After Modernism.”</p>
<p>A zealous convert to Catholicism and the <em>renouveau</em> in 1931, de Menil was the heiress to the Schlumberger oil prospecting fortune. Displaced by World War II to Houston in 1944, she remained committed to the <em>renouveau</em> as she transformed St. Thomas into a laboratory for sacred aesthetics. Her guiding ideal was that the church should work with artists to produce new sacred art and architecture. To that end she commissioned Philip Johnson to provide a master plan for the school and imported artists to campus in addition to Feldman, Stockhausen and Warhol among them.</p>
<p>De Menil’s collaboration with Feldman on “Six Painters” marked a shift in the composer’s modernist commitments. Long committed to a “Kierkegaardian faith in the emotions,” “After Modernism” finds Feldman adopting the anti-conceptual, anti-representational critique of modernism mounted by the <em>renouveau</em> that was, in the formulation of de Menil’s friend Jacques Maritain, simultaneously <em>antimoderne</em> and <em>ultramoderne</em>. Feldman sanctified not only his music but also abstract expressionist painting, in effect transposing the spiritual values of the <em>renouveau</em> onto the work of the New York avant-garde. The success of Feldman’s venture— at least with de Menil—ensured her continued patronage of sacred experimental music including Feldman’s <em>Rothko Chapel</em>, Steve Reich’s <em>Tehillim</em>, and La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela’s <em>Dream House</em>.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Lens of Disability in Darius Milhaud’s Postwar U.S. Reception</p>
<p class="abs-author">Erin K. Maher (Delaware Valley University)</p>

<p>“The conductor was so stiff with arthritis that he had to lead the orchestra sitting down” (<em>Time</em>, 1946). “Milhaud, Crippled by Arthritis, Conducts” (<em>New York Times</em>, 1957). “The old man painfully hobbled on two canes to the seat in the center of the podium” (<em>Time</em>, 1965). For more than twenty years, such sensationalist imagery was a standard opening formula for reviewing concerts in which Darius Milhaud (1892–1974) conducted his own music. The French composer, a part-time U.S. resident, insisted that his physical condition was outside the proper domain of the music critic. Nonetheless, perceptions of his mobility impairment brought a range of disability narratives to bear on how he and his compositions were understood.</p>
<p>This paper presents a disability-centered study of Milhaud’s postwar U.S. reception. Bringing newspaper and magazine articles together with Milhaud’s own perspective in his memoirs, interviews, and letters, I examine how critics, colleagues, and the composer himself interpreted the relationship between his health and his music. His prolific rate of composition already singled him out as an anomaly, and disability further marked him as exceptional in ways that intersected with opinions of his prolificacy. For supporters, his ongoing productivity signaled triumph over infirmity, or even creativity inspired by physical suffering; by contrast, critics who found his new music uninspired could invoke disability to give the impression of a composer whose body and creative power were equally impaired.</p>
<p>Through this analysis, I draw out and contextualize assumptions and stereotypes that continue to shape Milhaud’s reputation as a composer today. Moreover, Milhaud has figured only marginally in studies of musicians and disability, yet his career offers a rich site for exploring the ways in which the musical and the physical can interact in the construction of a composer’s public image. While the immediately visible nature of his condition recalls responses to disabled performers, visual observation also informed the hearing of his compositions in a distinct way. The centrality of this nexus to so much of Milhaud’s postwar reception presents a unique window on the interwoven tropes of embodiment and creativity in twentieth-century modernism.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Extended From What?: Confronting Constructions of Voice, Gender, and the Machine in the Canonization of “Extended” Vocal Techniques through Joan La Barbara’s <em>Cathing</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Charissa Noble (University of California, Santa Cruz)</p>

<p>As an avant-garde vocalist with a seemingly boundless repertory of vocal sounds, a composer of experimental tape pieces, an active music critic and advocate for her colleagues, Joan La Barbara occupied a central role in the American experimental musical community of the 1970s and ’80s. Her first <em>musique concrete</em> piece, <em>Cathing</em> (1977), features both her voice and that of Cathy Berberian, purported originator of extended vocal techniques. In a striking commentary, <em>Cathing</em> presents an excerpt of Berberian in a radio interview for the 1976 Holland Music Festival, where she declared that those who use extended vocal techniques are: “. . . freaks, they’re phenomena, what they used to call me. But it wasn’t really true in my case because I can really sing . . .”</p>
<p>Considering that scholarship on extended vocal techniques typically positions Berberian as founder, La Barbara’s illumination of this provocative interview reveals a significant historical oversight surrounding Berberian’s renunciation of extended vocality and La Barbara’s musical response. This paper investigates the social-historical context of <em>Cathing</em> and its attendant gender issues. Drawing from the work of Judith Butler and Suzanne Cusick, I posit that Berberian’s identification as a “singer” circumscribed her legibility as an experimental musician due to cultural conflations of vocal and gender norms.</p>
<p>By contrast, the electronic treatment of vocal timbre in <em>Cathing</em> substantiates La Barbara’s claim of voice as “instrumental.” In this paper, I read La Barbara’s editing techniques and electronic vocal manipulation as critical discourse about voice and normativity. By continually blurring the line between “human” and “technological” sound, <em>Cathing</em> challenges assumptions about the embodied nature of the voice through the rhetoric of instrumentalism and technology. This constantly shifting electronic treatment of both voices presents a sonic environment that subverts gender and vocal norms, and invites transformational possibility.</p>
