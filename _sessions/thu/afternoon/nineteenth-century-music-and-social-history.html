<p class="abs-title">Nineteenth-Century <em>Gehörbildung</em> as a Means of Self-Cultivation</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sara Ballance (University of California, Santa Barbara)</p>

<p>Writing in 1810, musician and pedagogue Hans Georg Nägeli outlined a new program for the education of the musical ear, or <em>Gehörbildung</em>, arguing that the intensive listening he encouraged was “the true cultural means of a genuine artistic sense.” Ear training was only beginning to become a dedicated form of musical study at the time, but Nägeli’s remarks indicate that it already carried far broader implications than the development of basic perception. In this paper, I examine a body of pedagogical and critical texts from the German practice of <em>Gehörbildung</em> as it developed in the early nineteenth century. Considering specific methodologies as well as the musical and cultural claims made on their behalf, I argue that this aural training represented a form of self-cultivation in the truest sense of the <em>Bildung</em> tradition. Thus, this early philosophy of <em>Gehörbildung</em> saw the development of skilled musical hearing as a way to pursue not only the inner depths of music, but also the inner depths of the self.</p>
<p>Cultural historians have observed that musical listening during the nineteenth century often served as a marker of inward-focused bourgeois identity. However, this scholarship has tended to overlook the pedagogical forms that explicitly sought to cultivate attentive listening. By connecting <em>Gehörbildung</em> with the broader philosophical, educational, and cultural framework of the <em>Bildung</em> tradition, I demonstrate that even the small-scale exercises of early ear training methods were intended to serve expansive cultural aims. I show first that <em>Gehörbildung</em> methods themselves derived philosophically from the educational reforms of Johann Pestalozzi and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which contributed much to the nineteenth-century <em>Bildung</em> concept. These methods reflect an ideology of experiential education, in which sensory-based learning was by necessity a process of self-discovery. More importantly, by examining the musical and philosophical claims made on behalf of these practices, I demonstrate that the cultivation of the ear was implicated in the broader aims of the <em>Bildung</em> tradition, fostering as well a refined sense of the individual within the sensory, musical, and cultural world.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Reception of German Music and Philosophy in Victorian Britain: George Eliot as Music Critic and Translator ca. 1855</p>
<p class="abs-author">Katherine Fry (London, England)</p>

<p>Scholars have long recognized the importance of music to the life and work of George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans). Musicologists have examined issues of music historiography and subjectivity in her 1876 novel <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, while literary critics have recently contextualized her fiction within a broader Victorian musical culture or “soundscape.” Literary discussions of this kind tend, understandably, to treat representations of music and sound as a cultural backdrop for renewed readings of her major novels. Departing from these approaches, this paper will focus on George Eliot’s musical travel writings and translations from the 1850s—writings that pre-date her career as a novelist and her adoption of the pen name George Eliot. Rather than consider Mary Ann Evan’s journalism merely as a preliminary to her novels, the paper will emphasize the critical and historical value of her early writings for the wider reception and dissemination of German musical culture and philosophy in nineteenth-century Britain. The first part of the paper will relate Evans’s translations of German philosophy (Ludwig Feuerbach in particular) to the larger discourse of idealism in Victorian thought, a discourse that impacted on perceptions of musical value in Britain. The second part will discus her essays on Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt, and Weimar culture, situating her musical travels within the context of British music criticism and European Wagnerism ca. 1855. In so doing, the paper seeks to complicate our understanding of Victorian musical culture and European modernism. It will explore how George Eliot’s writings contribute to contemporary debates about music, cultural exchange and transnationalism. Furthermore, it will consider how her journalism pertains to broader theoretical concerns about music’s relationship with language and criticism within and beyond the nineteenth century.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Musical Crimes and Misdemeanors from the Pages of the <em>Orchestra</em> (1863–81)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christine Kyprianides (IndyBaroque Music)</p>

<p>The Victorian press has long been a rich source of information regarding composers, conductors, distinguished soloists, operatic stars, and critics. Often left out of the picture were the foot soldiers of the music profession: the myriad freelance performers and teachers, as well as the smaller music merchants. In 1863, one notable magazine broke the mold, namely the <em>Orchestra</em>, billed as “a weekly review of music and the drama.” During its first decade, the magazine was published by the music firm of Cramer &amp; Co. Not only did the paper serve as a vehicle for advertising the Cramer merchandise, but also functioned as a trade journal for the larger music business. The paper’s tone was practical, lively, and combative, in contrast to other reviews aimed primarily at intellectuals and amateurs.</p>
<p>In this presentation, I consider how the <em>Orchestra</em>, facing competition from established periodicals such as the <em>Musical Times</em> and the <em>Musical World</em>, as well as from another newcomer, the <em>Musical Standard</em>, quickly developed its own voice as a chronicler of the music industry. Specifically, I examine the Orchestra’s extensive coverage of police reports, court cases, lawsuits, and parliamentary debates pertaining to the stage professions during the Cramer years. The topics included workplace safety, unregulated street musicians, frauds and swindles, contracts, and plagiarism. The emphasis on legal issues appears to have been part of Cramer &amp; Co.’s strategy of positioning the firm and its products to reach the rapidly expanding body of middle-class music professionals. While the journal’s uncompromising approach, verging at times on the inflammatory, provoked lawsuits and censure from the traditional press, it had a healthy circulation and wielded considerable influence.</p>
<p>While the <em>Orchestra</em> has been largely forgotten today, it provides an exceptional view of the music business at a time of great social change. It documents an era of increasing commercialization in which professional musicians were struggling to improve both their working conditions and their social status. In reconstructing British cultural and social history, we should be aware that such “lesser” periodicals have much to tell us about the progress of music in the Victorian age.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Professionalization of Music and the Edification of Amateur Music-Making in Nineteenth-Century London: A Challenge to the Development of Pure Listening</p>
<p class="abs-author">Wiebke Thormahlen (Royal College of Music)</p>

<p>This paper investigates the role of music in shaping social groups and in forming allegiances in nineteenth-century London, and its strategic employment to bind individuals emotionally to these allegiances. By investigating two key moments in London’s musical life—the foundation of the Philharmonic Society and twenty years later the formation of the Sacred Harmonic Society—through documents held in The Royal College of Music’s collections I argue that the manner in which music was received provided the key to its use as a political tool and a tool for social stratification.</p>
<p>The founding documents of both societies attest to the delineation of a rising musical professionalism, first instituted in the Royal Philharmonic Society, and— in contrast—the edification of amateur music making inscribed in the Sacred Harmonic Society’s emphasis on regular rehearsal over performance.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Sacred Harmonic Society coincides with the Great Reform Act; placing collectivity and religious music of all denominations at its centre, the founding fathers of the Society used music strategically to unify a large and religiously disparate band of society, uniting them in a feeling of nationalism and belonging. Thus, the Society can be seen as evidence to recent revisionist readings in History of the Reform Act as the beginning rather than the end of the rise of the middle classes.</p>
<p>The disparity between the two societies also uproots our traditional reading of the development of “pure listening.” While the development of pure listening as an aesthetic ideal has been tied to developments in concert culture around 1800 (with the Royal Philharmonic Society considered the affirming culmination of this pure listening in England), the Society was concerned far less with acts of listening and the philosophical depth of this engagement than with affirming class values through the establishment of professional musicians engaged by exclusively noble subscribers. Whereas the Royal Philharmonic Society affirmed class boundaries, the Sacred Harmonic Society gave rise to a middle class self-consciousness. The idea of pure listening was part of the reception of both as they came to stand side by side as London’s key concert activities around the 1850s.</p>
