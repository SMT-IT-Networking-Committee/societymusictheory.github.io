<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>This special session explores the nature of jazz tonality, with a focus on how Schenkerian views of tonality interact with jazz’s distinct qualities. The six papers of the session break into one-hour blocks: three pairs of papers, each followed by ten minutes of discussion. </p>
<p>Our first pair of papers addresses the non-chord tone. Stefan Caris Love argues that jazz melody is organized around “ladders of thirds,” defined by melodic behavior alone, with roots in early African-American music. These clash with the accompanying harmony in novel ways. Daniel J. Arthurs applies Schenkerian analysis to Brad Mehldau’s “Sehnsucht” to reveal how its traditional, three-stage suspensions express the nineteenth-century affect of Romantic longing, at multiple levels.</p>
<p>In our second hour, presenters consider jazz form. Improvised solos typically span multiple cycles of a theme (“choruses”); each chorus ends with tonal closure. Michael Schachter describes two strategies with which improvisers can bridge these gaps: obfuscation of the theme’s closure, and inter-chorus modulation. Ben Geyer examines form in the “second practice” compositions of the 1960s. He advocates analysis grounded in departure and arrival within a hypermetrical time-span, rather than tonal prolongation. </p>
<p>The papers in our third hour adapt the Schenkerian approach to later jazz styles. Nolan Stolz poses an alternative <i>Ursatz</i> for Chick Corea’s “King Cockroach,” generated by the 027 “sus” chord: the <i>Urlinie</i> is ^2–^1, the structural bass, ^1–^5–^1. Finally, examining Thelonious Monk’s “Green Chimneys,” Rich Pellegrin makes a case for Salzerian analysis of modal/postbop jazz, emphasizing salience in lieu of tonal resolution.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Jazz Melody and the Logic of Thirds</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stefan Love (University of Massachusetts Amherst)</p>

<p>Tonal jazz melody features extended dissonances that behave like chord tones, and frequent conflict between melody and accompaniment. The Schenkerian approach assumes that melody and harmony form a unified contrapuntal whole. Jazz’s extended dissonances “represent and substitute for” more consonant pitches (Strunk); conflicts between melody and accompaniment are resolved by implied tones, among other means. The coherence of this approach is undeniable. But I challenge the assumption that jazz and common-practice melody are essentially alike.</p>
    <p>Peter van der Merwe identifies “ladders of thirds”—tertian structures of varying size—as foundational to early African-American song. Here, I argue that these structures also underlie tonal jazz melody. Regardless of the harmonic context, if a melody note <i>acts like</i> a chord tone—if it is leapt to or from, or participates in the right way in a melodic idiom—then it <i>is</i> a “ladder tone,” part of a ladder of thirds. The resulting ladders may assimilate the accompanying harmony; for example, a ninth above a dominant seventh chord will assimilate dominant function, not because it “substitutes for” the root, but because it implies a ladder extending from 5. They may also assert their independence; for example, a blues chorus can be organized entirely around a tonic triad and its lower third, heedless of the changing harmony. Stepwise paths emerge from the succession of ladders, often incorporating “unresolved” dissonances. The ladders and stepwise paths form the melody’s irreducible structural core. </p>



<p class="abs-title">Tonal Motion and the Suspension in Brad Mehldau’s <i>Sehnsucht</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Danny Arthurs (University of Tulsa)</p>

<p>Henry Martin has written, “rarely [are suspensions] prepared and resolved [in jazz] as in common-practice theory”. From this basic observation one may be struck by the music of Brad Mehldau, whose 1997 piece “Sehnsucht” demonstrates at least a dozen traditional suspensions in a 36-bar form. This places his approach to the suspension in direct opposition to the way jazz composers typically are instructed on using “sus”-chords, which generally are treated as vertical entities with no need for resolution. Given the fundamental differences between classical suspensions and jazz sus-chords, to indicate through chord symbols something as simple as a 4–3 motion requires some effort, and so it comes as no surprise to see within the published score a variety of different chord symbols to represent such a common figure. </p>
<p>In this paper I shall demonstrate how linear events in general—and the suspension in particular—underpin standard jazz harmony in Mehldau’s music. I argue, further, that the suspension creates the effect of musical motion and goal-orientation. Together, these characteristics promote the perception of beginning–middle–end that is essential to triadic tonal principles in music of the common practice. Added to this premise will be the Romantic ideal of “Sehnsucht,” the perception of infinite longing. Through these concepts I identify tonally ambiguous features from an essentially triadic perspective. Skewed tonal durations (after Samarotto) represented by an abundance of suspensions aptly draws attention to this emblematic German Romantic emotional state. </p>


<p class="abs-title">A Closer Look at Harmonic Prolongation in Jazz Performance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Schachter (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>Straight-ahead jazz performances usually exhibit a common form: after playing a composed song in full (the “head”), performers alternate taking improvised solos over repeated iterations of the song’s metric and harmonic structure (“choruses”), closing the tune with a final rendering of the head. While it is quite common for jazz players to construct <i>narrative</i> arcs in their improvised solos that span multiple choruses, this rhetorical trajectory usually belies conformity to the recursive <i>tonal</i> closure attendant with each chorus. My question in this paper is simple: to what extent is long-range tonal trajectory possible across jazz tunes whose heads feature putatively closed harmonic forms? If so, what does this look like? Jazz scholars have typically approached jazz harmony along similar lines to Schenker’s (1935) account of Western theme-and-variations form: the head comprises a complete harmonic entity, with improvised choruses representing tonally segmented “strophes” (Owens 1974, Strunk 1979, Martin 1996, Larson 2009). This analytical approach, while providing a valuable heuristic to understanding normative performance practice, downplays the role that long-range harmonic designs often play at the hands of many great artists. Drawing on examples in performances by Keith Jarrett, Teddy Wilson, Jelly Roll Morton, George Shearing, and the Tony Williams Trio, I discuss two techniques by which performers manage to construct long-range tonal trajectory across their performances: (a) using reharmonization to obfuscate the harmonic closure prescribed by the song form, and (b) introducing carefully charted modulations across the various choruses of a solo and/or subsections of a composition. </p>

<p class="abs-title">Prolongation in Jazz: A Skeptical View</p>
<p class="abs-author">Benjamin Geyer (Oberlin College Conservatory)</p>

<p>In discipline-defining publications, Henry Martin (1996) and Steve Larson (1998) have advocated for the suitability of Schenkerian analysis for the study of jazz. However, this endeavor seems to stall when faced with a style pioneered by Wayne Shorter in the 1960s, dubbed “second practice jazz” by Keith Waters (2013). In a study of Shorter’s compositions, Martin concludes, “as jazz pieces gradually deviate from the norms of the standard repertory, their analysis by voice leading and prolongation becomes more problematic. Eventually, we are confronted with nontonal pieces . . . whose harmonies may best be described by pitch sets, in which the issue of prolongation is controversial” (2014). This paper explores the nature of this controversy.</p>
<p>As crystallized in Joseph Straus’s “embellishment condition,” prolongation depends on “a consistent set of relationships between tones of lesser and greater structural weight” (1987: 4), and theorizing such a system of relationships on the basis of pitch would seem to oppose the aesthetic achievement of this repertoire. Second practice jazz does, however, have another characteristic that unifies it with historically prior styles: hypermetrical normativity. I argue that, while voice-leading prolongation has not been universally required for stylistic well-formedness, hypermeter has been an important hierarchical organizer throughout the jazz tradition. Analyzing examples from numerous jazz styles, I create a narrative of hypermetrical normativity—and not monotonality—as the thread uniting the jazz tradition.</p>


<p class="abs-title">A Neo-Schenkerian Hearing of Chick Corea’s <i>King Cockroach</i> (1986)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nolan Stolz (University of South Carolina Upstate)</p>

<p>At the musical surface of Chick Corea’s “King Cockroach,” from <i>The Chick Corea Elektric Band</i>, lie tertian structures common to tonal jazz, but the harmonic progressions and the middleground and background levels are post-tonal. Thus, a traditional Schenkerian approach to this work would be insufficient for an adequate analytical hearing. Scholars have posed modifications of Schenker’s theories, such as additional <i>Ursätze</i> to his original three (Martin 2011). This paper demonstrates how “King Cockroach” is generated not from the consonant triad, but from the 027 “sus” chord: the <i>Urlinie</i> is ^2–^1, the structural bass ^1–^5–^1. The 027 trichord also appears at the musical foreground, most strikingly at the end of the piece. “Sus” chord harmony (including its 027 subset) is certainly not foreign to jazz after 1960. It is conceivable, then, that such a composition could be generated from 027 at the most fundamental level.</p>
<p>This paper examines the formal structure of the work, as it does not follow the repeated chorus format commonly found in jazz. The exposition is relatively unstable harmonically, not settling until the first solo, during which the <i>Kopfton</i> is introduced (^2). The entire work leads to the coda—which is harmonically the simplest—and where the resolution from ^2 to ^1 occurs. The composed sections are harmonically complex and syncopated, the improvised solo sections are more stable, and the coda is the simplest harmonically and rhythmically. It is this motion toward stability that denotes the coda as the teleological goal of the piece.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Structural Closure and Motivic Paraellelism in a Performance of <i>Green Chimneys</i> by the Thelonious Monk Quartet</p>
<p class="abs-author">Richard Pellegrin (University of Missouri)</p>

This presentation features a reductive analysis of a complete performance of “Green Chimneys” by the Thelonious Monk Quartet, that which appears on Columbia Records’ 1996 reissue of <i>Straight, No Chaser</i> (1967). Because this composition and performance lie outside the bounds of tonal jazz, I adopt a Salzerian approach, according increased weight to salience (as opposed to pitch stability and tonal resolution) and employing a bottom-up analytical technique. My analysis demonstrates that the same type of sophisticated large-scale organization that Schenker, Salzer, and Larson have found in the repertories with which they are most associated may also be found in modal/postbop jazz. Motivic parallelism is shown to be present on all structural levels—that of a complete multi-chorus improvisation, a complete single-chorus improvisation, the solo section taken as a whole, the composition itself, as well as various lower levels.
