<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Our panel will focus on the important contributions of the late German musi- cologist, Carl Dahlhaus to the history of music theory. This is a subject that oc- cupies an important place in Dahlhaus’s immense musicological œuvre. And in many ways, it encapsulates better than anything else his well-known interest in mediating dialectically between history and theory.</p>
<p>Despite the growth of historical music theory as a research subject in the United States, Dahlhaus’s many writings on the topic are not widely known here, due largely, we might surmise, to language barriers. At the same time, English-lan- guage scholarship on the historical study of music theory has tended to take a rather different approach to the subject.</p>
<p>Over the course of our session we hope to discuss a wide variety of historio- graphic problems relating to music theory using Dahlhaus’s provocative writings as a touchstone. A good entry point will be his seminal article “Was heißt Ge- schichte der Musiktheorie?” (“What is the History of Music Theory?”), published in 1985. There, Dahlhaus lays out a comprehensive historical taxonomy of music theories, juxtaposing in his characteristically dialectical style the “internal” fea- tures of the discipline with external factors such as changing musical practice, varied institutional settings, and the emergence of the autonomous art work as an aesthetic premise for musical analysis. He thereby shows that a “history” of mu- sic theory cannot be presented as a mere description of individual music theories succeeding one another over time, but as often incommensurate and overlapping paradigms.</p>

<p class="abs-title">On the Implicit and Explicit Reception of Dahlhaus’s “Was heißt Geschichte der Musiktheorie?”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jan Philipp Sprick (Hochschule für Musik und Theater, Rostock)</p>
<p>My paper deals with the reception history of Carl Dahlhaus’s seminal text, “Was heißt ‘Geschichte der Musiktheorie?’” This reception is less focused on the text as a whole than on the discussion of single aspects. The reception of “Was heißt ‘Geschichte der Musiktheorie?’” may be narrowed down to one of the main features of Dahlhaus’s texts on history of music theory in general: the mixture of historiographical narration and systematic theory. Comparable to Riemann’s</p>
<p>monumental <em>Geschichte der Musiktheorie</em>, Dahlhaus’s text results in an implicit description of a music theoretical <em>status quo</em> at his time. Dahlhaus abandons a strictly historical perspective, as in all his contributions to the history of music theory. In light of current music theoretical discourse, in which an eclecticism of historical and systematic methods becomes predominant, Dahlhaus’s dialectical and complex arguments are still waiting for an explicit reception.</p>
<p>I will focus in particular on Dahlhaus’s position concerning the relation of his- torical and current concepts of music theory, on the liaison of music theory and aesthetics, and the way music theory and composition influence each other. All these aspects are important topics in the history of theory as well as in current mu- sic theoretical thinking. Against this background, Dahlhaus could well have used a different title for his text: Instead of “What is the History of Music Theory?” he could have asked “What is Music Theory?”</p>

<p class="abs-title">“What Is the History of Music Theory?” Dahlhaus’s Essay and Its Relevance for the Current Understanding of the Discipline</p>
<p class="abs-author">Frank Heidlberger, University of North Texas</p>
<p>Discourse about the history of music theory both as an academic discipline and as a field of historical inquiry has developed immensely in the course of the last thirty years. Its significance as an academic field besides or—as Ian Bent has de- scribed it—“in between” music theory and music history has steadily increased. Thomas Christensen’s <em>Cambridge History of Western Music Theory</em> (2002) has helped to put the field onto a new level in classroom instruction that was seem- ingly impossible before.</p>
<p>All these developments are related to Dahlhaus’s historiography of music the- ory to various degrees. This fact poses the central question of this paper: is Dahl- haus’s essay (1985), in its inclusiveness, outdated, or is it still relevant?</p>
<p>The concept of “shift of paradigm” is prominently represented in Dahlhaus’s essay. This term was introduced by Thomas Kuhn (1962) and refers strictly to the natural sciences. Dahlhaus modifies its application in order to make it compatible with historiographic methodologies. This paper will differentiate and exemplify this shift by discussing one of Dahlhaus’s examples, the term of “consonantia imperfecta.” Dahlhaus refers to this term repeatedly, pointing out its hybrid mean- ing in between traditions of speculative theory and musical “craftsmanship.” This provokes a deeper question of how theoretical traditions relate to each other by their ontological background versus their practical and prescriptive foreground.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Dahlhaus’s “Was heisst Geschichte der Musiktheorie?” Between Kuhn and Weber</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nathan John Martin (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>In the fifth section of his foundational essay “Was heißt Geschichte der Musik- theorie?” (1985), Carl Dahalhaus reaches briefly for Thomas Kuhn’s idea of a “paradigm shift” as a model for understanding change in the history of music theory. Yet the analogy is obviously problematic, as Dahlhaus is well aware. For Kuhn, the pursuit of normal scientific research tends, in and of itself, to produce occasional anomalies. Sometimes, the accretion of anomalies precipitates a crisis, which is resolved only by the emergence of a new paradigm to supplant the old. The shifts that Dahlhaus charts, in contrast, are fundamentally driven by devel- opments external to music theory, both in such adjacent fields as aesthetics and composition and in their embracing social, cultural, and intellectual contexts.</p>
<p>So why, if the fit is so poor, does Dahlhaus reach for Kuhn at all? The answer, I argue, lies in dynamics internal to Dahlhaus’ text. The abstractions Dahlhaus pos- its are essentially conceived as “ideal types” in Max Weber’s sense. Yet Dahlhaus nonetheless tends to hypostatize them—to slip into describing these abstractions as if they were real forces operative within and behind historical music-theoretical discourses. This shift, combined with Dahlhaus’ resolute historicism, begins to trap him in a historiographical problem: for his categories threaten to congeal into static, immovable archetypes. The attraction of Kuhn, I suggest, lay in the glim- mer of a way out of this aporia—in the possibility, however fraught, of accounting for historical change while avoiding the Whigish triumphalism of Hugo Riemann.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Dahlhaus and the Origins of the <em>Origin</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Thomas Christensen (University of Chicago)</p>

<p>Carl Dahlhaus’s <em>Studies on the Origins of Harmonic Tonality</em> (1968; Eng. Edi- tion 1990) helped to cement the status of the author as one of the leading histori- ans of music theory by critically examining a wide range of historical theories of tonality along with a consideration of their value to the analysis of music from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>Today, the context of Dahlhaus’s monumental book may not be clear to English readers, as it engages in dialogue (sometimes explicitly, often implicitly) with a number of other musicologists who were writing during the two decades im- mediately preceding its publication about questions related to the origins of har- monic tonality. First among these writers was Heinrich Besseler, whose mono- graph <em>Bourdon und Fauxbourdon</em> (1950) placed the origins of harmonic tonality squarely on the shoulders of Dufay and his contemporaries. Besseler’s work soon launched a heated and prolonged academic debate that would eventually bring in the voices of a dozen of the leading German musicologists from the time. In my paper, I will try to situate Dahlhaus’s study as something of a capstone to this lively debate. I will conclude with some thoughts as to why the question of tonal- ity’s origins suddenly seemed to have become an issue of such vital importance to German musicologists writing in the post-war decades.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The History of Music Theory after Dahlhaus’s <em>Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality</em>: On the Relationship between Musical Concepts and Musical Phenomena</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stefano Mengozzi (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>Meant as counterweight to Hugo Riemann’s materialistic approach to the evo- lution of Western harmony, Carl Dahlhaus’s <em>Untersuchungen über die Entstehung der harmonischen Tonalität</em> (1968) portrayed tonality as the historically circum- scribed product of modern musical consciousness. To Dahlhaus, tonal music does not just <em>sound</em> tonal; rather, it is demonstrably <em>conceived</em> as such. In line with this fundamental assumption, Dahlhaus’s theory of tonality rests not so much on analyses of musical behaviors, and their transformations through time, but rather on the changing terminology of the musical treatises, which trace the gradual emergence of the critically important tonal concepts.</p>
<p>However, the belief that music-theoretical concepts, expressed in language, are the ultimate litmus test for discriminating between the tonal and the non-tonal is open to debate. Theorizing about musical phenomena is arguably a messy and historically contingent activity that hardly supports Dahlhaus’s strict “theory- to-practice” approach to the history of harmonic tonality. Musical concepts may plausibly be viewed as superimposed upon musical phenomena <em>a posteriori,</em> often through a rather circuitous process, rather than as radically determining their on- tology by “underlying” them <em>from within</em>.</p>
<p>Dahlhaus’s recognition that harmony could not be reduced to its material basis was his invaluable contribution to the understanding of this thorny topic; his her- meneutic model, however, may have gone a step too far in the direction of ideal- ism and metaphysics. The challenge now posed by the <em>Untersuchungen</em> is one of articulating a notion of tonal consciousness that strikes a new balance between materialist and idealist conceptions of musical sound.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Theorist and Teacher of Theory. Carl Dahlhaus as a Model for the Classroom Teaching of Music Theory at German Conservatories</p>
<p class="abs-author">Gesine Schröder (Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien/Hochschule für Musik und Theater “Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy”)</p>

<p>It is an assumption that music theory at German conservatories owes its his- torical perspective to Carl Dahlhaus, specifically the access to historical harmony and counterpoint, and in particular the understanding of music analysis explor- ing voice-leading patterns. However, Dahlhaus’s methodology of music theory is governed by norms and rules, and is inundated with countless iterations of lan- guage and terminology. Dahlhaus did not provide any readily applicable teaching model for theory professors; instead, he engaged in discussions with other theo- rists such as Diether de la Motte (1968) and Ernst Apfel (1974). This approach is legitimized by the fact that at German conservatories music theory is treated as an applied musical discipline, which focuses on discussions held in private small- group lessons with two to five students.</p>
<p>This paper analyzes oral statements by Dahlhaus and his students. Dahlhaus’s opinion about conservatory theory will be highlighted through a lens that a recent publication metaphorically called the “long summer of theory”: strong doubts, endless discussions, attacks on other academic authorities, combined with the ad- miration for the great masters. I will evaluate a variety of sources for this purpose, such as the conference proceedings “Music Theory,” Stuttgart 1971, a TV discus- sion from 1973, and my own memories. It is enlightening for the reconstruction of Dahlhaus’s theoretical ambitions around 1970—the beginning of the <em>Geschich- te der Musiktheorie</em> project—to investigate how he dealt with left-wing theory colleagues. Dahlhaus acted as an “über-smart” and diabolically “right-wingish” provocateur.</p>
