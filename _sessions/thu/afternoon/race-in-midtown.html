<p class="abs-title">Jim Crow in Times Square: Racial Segregation as a Structural Element of Broadway Musical Theatre History</p>
<p class="abs-author">Todd Decker (Washington University in St Louis)</p>

<p>The so-called Broadway theatres clustered around Times Square anoint particular musical theatre works and performers as national in their meanings. But these theatres are also local, part of the geography of New York City. The remarkably stable architectural fabric serving the Broadway musical—dating mostly to the 1910s and 1920s—is located in a neighborhood that, like all of the United States, can be understood through the practices of racial segregation. Indeed, the Broadway theatres and their Times Square context constitute a unique liminal zone: a commercial entertainment district in a white part of Manhattan that has welcomed temporary tenancy by African Americans, mostly in the form of the black-cast musical. The allowance for African Americans to take up residency reveals another unusual feature of the neighborhood: Times Square real estate comes in three varieties—street, stage, and house. Different regimes of segregation obtain in each. For example, in the 1920s, black patrons were generally refused service in restaurants and often limited to balcony seats in the house while black performers took positions of power on stage addressing white audiences (always, of course, within the limits of Broadway’s intensely commercial production context). The contrast between the stage (a mostly segregated zone into the present) and street and house (eventually desegregated if never really integrated) proves a defining structural element across musical theatre history.</p>
<p>This paper re-constructs the shifting color line in Times Square by way of an interactive digital humanities research tool which maps activity in Broadway theatres from 1900 to the present in month-by-month snapshots of the production landscape of the musical. Offering at once broad and detailed pictures of the genre’s racial history, this tool shifts the scholarly focus from works and creative figures to venues, performers, audiences, and the totality of musical theatre activity in New York City. As a result, black performers on Broadway stages—almost always contained within the segregated confines of the black-cast musical—are placed in context with white performers and the ebb and flow of racial segregation in Times Square and the Broadway musical can be seen in concrete terms.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“A Dash of Hi-di-hi”: Balanchine’s Met <em>Aida</em>, 1935</p>
<p class="abs-author">Marian Smith (University of Oregon)</p>

<p>In 1935, a new production of <em>Aida</em>, with choreography by George Balanchine, premiered at the Metropolitan Opera. Some spectators were offended by the sight of scantily clad black men dancing with white women in the Act II “Negro dance,” and gossip columnist Dorothy Kilgallen averred that Balanchine had infused the opera with a “dash of hi-di-hi.”</p>
<p>Kilgallen’s implication that Balanchine’s <em>Aida</em> drew from African American vernacular sources was emphatically denied in <em>Blast at Ballet</em>, a polemical pamphlet by Lincoln Kirstein, the young philanthropist who was Balanchine’s staunchest supporter. Kirstein foresaw a brilliant future for Balanchine as a <em>classical</em> choreographer, and insisted that the inspiration for <em>Aida</em> had come strictly from museums and history books.</p>
<p>In this paper, I argue that, aside from causing an uproar over its sexually charged integrated couple dances, Balanchine’s <em>Aida</em> illuminates the sharp divisions in a bitter public dispute between Kirstein and <em>New York Times</em> dance critic John Martin over the very definition of American ballet. For Martin (who had pushed for Agnes de Mille to be hired by the Met instead of Balanchine), it required an American choreographer. For Kirstein, it depended, at least until American ballet could become fully established, on “the finest Russian standards” for classical dance. But for Balanchine, who never weighed in publicly in the debate, it entailed American movement styles—which could include the contemporary dance of black America and Broadway.</p>
<p>Indeed, Balanchine was comfortable working on Broadway and at the Met simultaneously, though no scholar of either music or dance (including Met historians Kolodin, and Affron and Affron, and Balanchine biographers Taper, Gottlieb, and Teachout) has studied how Balanchine brought elements of popular dance to the Met.</p>
<p>I demonstrate that Balanchine’s <em>Aida</em> did draw both choreography and style from living African-American dancers on Broadway. Though Genné and Gottschild, respectively, have identified African American influences on <em>Apollo</em> (1928) and <em>The Four Temperaments</em> (1946), Balanchine’s African American source material for <em>Aida</em> has not heretofore been recognized.</p>
