<p class="abs-title">The Maniac’s Affliction: Music, Madness, and Caprice in Late Eighteenth Century Spain</p>

<p>Gaetano Brunetti’s only programmatic symphony, <em>Il maniático</em> (1780), incorporated a recurring musical idea to represent madness, a technique that predates Berlioz’s <em>idée fixe</em> by decades. Brunetti provided a “program” on the cover page, detailing the nature of the maniac’s affliction and its musical depiction: the delirious person is fixated by a trill-like figure for solo cello that he is unable to escape, despite an “infinite variety” of themes that are presented to persuade him to happiness. Despite its seemingly unprecedented program, Brunetti’s symphony has been continually overlooked by scholars. In her illuminating work on Berlioz and the <em>idée fixe</em>, Francesca Brittan (2006) suggested that Brunetti was making an early reference to an obsessive type of madness, later defined in French psychiatric circles as <em>monomania</em>. In this paper, I will propose an immediate context in the medical discourses of mania at the Spanish court, where Brunetti held a lifelong position. Of particular relevance are the writings of court physician Andrés Piquer, who coined the term <em>affectio melancholico-maníaca</em> to diagnose the medical afflictions of two Spanish kings, Felipe V and Fernando VI. Piquer’s notion of a “melancholic-maniacal affect”—intermittent in nature, and manifesting itself as an intense obsession with death that could not be assuaged by “pleasant and clever attempts” at conversation—has recently been identified by medical historians as a precursor to the modern manic-depressive or bipolar disorder (Pérez et al., 2011; Baldessarini et al., 2015). I also suggest that Brunetti’s symphony and Piquer’s <em>Discurso</em> (1759) provide an important context for the <em>Caprichos</em> of another court artist, Francisco Goya, who has long been known for his own preoccupations of madness and melancholy. Juxtaposing my analysis of <em>Il maniático</em> with a reading of Goya’s <em>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</em> (1798), I will argue that both Brunetti and Goya portrayed a specific medical condition that would have been recognized by members of the Spanish royal court. This paper explores the shared history of art and medicine, and contributes to our increasingly rich understanding of musical life in eighteenth century Spain (LeGuin, 2006, 2014; Maron and Bernadó, 2014).</p>



<p class="abs-title">Enlightened or Feverish? Tarantism and the Formation of Public Opinion in Spain</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ana Sánchez-Rojo (Tulane University)</p>

<p>A series of articles about cases of tarantism in Madrid captivated the city dwellers in 1786–87. The phenomenon combined two of the favorite topics of the incipient public opinion in Spain: music and medicine. Just as the venom of the tarantula infiltrated the victim’s body, music penetrated his senses to counteract the poison in a display of para-scientific healing. As Andrea J. Smidt and other scholars of Catholic Enlightenment demonstrate, the Spanish assimilated the paradigms of science and reason within rather than at the expense of religion. At the edge of the Enlightenment, tarantism enacted body-world interactions in terms that agreed with Lockean empiricism yet allowed for faith in the miraculous.</p>
<p>I will focus on public opinion around tarantism in central Spain as recorded in two works from 1787: Francisco Xavier Cid’s medical book <em>Tarantismo observado en Espana</em>, and composer Pablo Esteve’s (ca. 1730–94) music theater piece <em>El Atarantulado</em> (<em>The Tarantula-bitten Man</em>). From Cid’s scientific treatise to Esteve’s entertainment tonadilla escénica, tarantism set in motion conversations about the possibility of integrating traditional beliefs with scientific knowledge. Expanding upon Giorgio Baglivi’s studies of tarantism in Apulia (1737), Cid refuted the assertion of the French encyclopedists that healing through music existed only in the fantasy of the gullible. While Cid aspired to contribute to the European medical corpus with a uniquely Spanish perspective, Esteve staged the everyday mechanics of local circulation of knowledge to the beat of Italianate music similar to the one suggested to cure the spider bite.</p>
<p>By examining medical and musical accounts of tarantism, I argue that public debates about music shaped modern opinion in Spain before the private and the public became institutionalized in the bourgeois family and the nation-state respectively. Even though music in late-eighteenth century Madrid neither represented nor questioned the political establishment, it guided Spanish people from the old to the new order without threatening their religious identity.</p>
