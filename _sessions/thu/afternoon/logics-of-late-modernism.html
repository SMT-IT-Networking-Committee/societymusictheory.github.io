<p class="abs-title">Harmonic Dualism in Ben Johnston’s Ninth String Quartet</p>
<p class="abs-author">Laurence Willis (McGill University)</p>

<p>Ben Johnston’s just-intonation music is of startling aural variety and presents novel solutions to age-old tuning problems. In this paper, I show that Johnston’s Ninth String Quartet synthesizes Harry Partch’s dualist tuning theories with common-practice tonality in a process that spans the entire work. This procedure grows from the dual kernels of the syntonic comma and the symmetrical relationship between overtonal and undertonal pitch generation. Across the work, Johnston reveals an evolution from straightforward diatonicism to a developed tonal language integrating unusual triadic sonorities with background tonal relationships taking advantage of the just tuning available in his notation system. This is suggestive of Johnston’s deep integration of dualist thought and its harmonic repercussions. I trace the intellectual context for Johnston’s music by examining his relationship with Partch before describing his just-intonation system in practical musical terms. This is in preparation for close study of his Ninth String Quartet focused on harmonic content in tonal context to help situate the function of just intervals. My paper provides an example of an analytical method for discussing Johnston’s works in a way that moves beyond simply describing the structure of his system and into more musically tangible questions of form and process.</p>

<p>Salvatore Sciarrino’s music often features obsessive, non-developmental repetition of subtly varied motivic figures, resulting in a fragmented texture that seems to prioritize local nuance over larger formal processes and directed motion. My paper explores the unique forms resulting from such repetitions in two of Sciarrino’s recent large-scale instrumental works: String Quartet no. 8 and <em>Shadow of Sound</em>. Sciarrino’s repetitions often engross the listener in a sensuous, moment-to-moment experience while obscuring larger connections. I demonstrate how some such fragmented music nevertheless gives shape to longer durations, by creating subtle processes of change or by recontextualizing repeated material to prompt a shift in the listener’s temporal or textural focus. These processes often lead to musical forms in which the lowest and highest levels of organization are clear, but a middle level is ambiguous or missing. My approach to form and temporality</p>
<p>in Sciarrino’s work coordinates aspects of Hasty’s (1981; 1984; 1986) work on phrase formation with Hanninen’s (2012; 2003) theories of segmentation, association, and recontextualization. Recent theoretical writings evince a broad interest in repetition’s role in the perception and analysis of musical coherence and structure (Margulis 2014; Hanninen 2012; Ockelford 2005). More specifically, Leydon (2002) considers the varied effects of “obstinate repetition” in minimalism, calling on analysts to further explore and codify the variety of possible “repetition strategies.” My paper extends these inquiries through analysis of Sciarrino’s music, which reiterates material “obstinately,” but with a non-minimalist approach to variation and process that provides a fresh outlook on repetition strategies and their effects.</p>
