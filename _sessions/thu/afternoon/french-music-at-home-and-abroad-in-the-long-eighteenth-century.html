<p class="abs-title">Out with the Old, In with the New: Music and Regime Change During the French Occupation of Mainz, 1792–93</p>
<p class="abs-author">Austin Glatthorn (Dalhousie University)</p>

<p>On 21 October 1792 French Republican troops marched into Mainz. This event signaled the beginning of the end for the musical ensembles that once flourished in this key electoral capital of the Holy Roman Empire. Indeed, contemporary critics considered the elector’s <em>Hofkapelle</em> and <em>Nationaltheater</em>—which staged around 430 performances of sixty-nine different operas between 1788 and 1792—among the best in the vast <em>Reich</em>. Yet despite their renown and importance, Mainz’s ensembles in the years of revolution remain almost unknown. This paper investigates court music in Mainz during the French occupation of 1792–93 to shed new light on German musical life at the crossroads of the Old and New Regimes.</p>
<p>Archival documents, including a collection of letters written by Mainz musicians in the autumn of 1792, help to explain this significant—yet little-understood—moment in music history. Earlier that summer, the Mainz <em>Nationaltheater</em> and <em>Hofkapelle</em> performed opera as well as the Masses for Emperor Franz II’s imperial election and coronation, just as they had for those of Leopold II in 1790. Consequently, the elector’s musicians enjoyed the honor and prestige of having participated in these national celebrations. However, at the height of the ensembles’ national success, the tide of war had swung in favor of the French, whose troops advanced deeper into the Rhineland. After the court fled in haste, Mainz’s musicians were faced with the choice to remain or to seek employment elsewhere as the enemy approached their city. This paper explores the effects of the French conquest of Mainz on musicians whose livelihood depended on the now-absent court and illustrates that, for musicians, the arrival of the French Revolutionary Army constituted occupation rather than liberation. I argue that the abrupt installation of a new democratic government led to a musical (e)migration and the collapse of the ensembles that had once prospered in the city under the Old Regime. By exploring music in Mainz at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, we may better understand this crucial period of transformation in European (music) history.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Silent Songs, Royal Orgies: Listening to the Political Pornography of the French Revolution</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jenna Harmon (Northwestern University)</p>

<p>In the years leading up to and during the French Revolution, politically motivated pornographic pamphlets shaped political beliefs and feelings. Specifically, they imparted the message that social disorder was intimately connected with sexual deviancy; such behavior among the ruling class indicated not only sexual crime, but also political corruption. The rise in pornographic pamphlet literature coincided with the growing popularity of vaudevilles, or satirical stage works that commented on current events through the use of newly texted popular song. These two genres combined in several pamphlets from the Revolutionary era, including <em>Le Branle des Capucins</em> (1791), <em>L’Autrichienne en goguettes, ou L’orgie royale</em> (1789), and <em>Les Putains Clo”trées</em> (1796). Previous interpretations of such pamphlets, most notably by Chantal Thomas and Lynn Hunt, have focused on the political and gender aspects of the texts, considering at length the various meanings that Marie Antoinette embodied for the French people; namely, epitomizing the decadence of the aristocracy, as well as a general contempt for the French people. While their work has been valuable, both miss the musical dimensions of these documents, and as a result, their latent emotional power and musico-cultural significance, given the important role that royally supported institutions like the Opéra and the Comédie-Italienne played in presenting music to the populace.</p>
<p>Identifying the cited tunes and tracing them back to their contemporaneous contexts allows for a consideration of the affective impact of the cited tunes on contemporary audiences, as well as an insight into a shared Parisian soundscape that cut across class divisions while defining the boundaries of a particular community. Since these pamphlets feature no musical notation, my analysis derives from the textual citation of titles of popular melodies and the author’s new text. From these brief descriptions, I cross-reference the incipits with various musical collections, most notably the Chansonnier Maurepas (BN Français 12657), for musical notation. Like the broad, titillating appeal of the sexual encounters described in the pamphlets, the vaudevilles of these pamphlets crossed socioeconomic divides by drawing on melodies sung in the streets, on the stages of the boulevard fairs, and even on the stage of the Opéra.</p>

<p class="abs-title">From a Tune’s-Eye View: French Theater Music in London, 1714–45</p>
<p class="abs-author">Erica Levenson (Cornell University)</p>

<p>Between 1718 and 1735, French acting troupes performed over 175 French plays from the Parisian repertoire of the Théâtres de la foire, Théâtre Italien, and Comédie-Française on London stages. These productions contained an assortment of music, including popular French tunes (<em>vaudevilles</em>), parodied operatic airs (<em>airs parodiés</em>), and musical scenes with dancing (<em>divertissements</em>). Yet, this music also possessed a social life that extended far beyond London playhouses: it appeared in English sources as varied as French grammar treatises, amateur music notebooks, drinking song collections, and even political manifestos. Despite French theatrical music’s widespread circulation throughout unexpected corners of London culture, scholarship on this topic has focused predominantly on issues of authorship and national origins rather than on music’s social and cultural consumption.</p>
<p>By tracing unassuming French tunes throughout a multitude of media and contexts, this paper unearths the quotidian networks by which French theatrical music entered the everyday lives and ultimately public consciousness of Londoners. Although a London socialite might encounter these tunes while learning the French language, dancing a French minuet, or singing drinking songs with friends, she could also witness the French acting troupes sing and dance these same tunes on London stages. I argue that these multi-sensorial modes of musical dissemination created a symbiotic relationship between published sources, theatrical productions, and their consumers. Because Londoners absorbed French music through activities outside the playhouse that involved memory and repetition, they were equipped to understand the pervasive satirical commentary in the French plays, which often hinged on the recognition of specific tunes. Notated French tunes in English books and periodicals, likewise, attained new meanings after experienced in a live, dramatic context. Furthermore, while French tunes on Parisian stages served as music for diverse social classes, the English nobility became French theatrical music’s primary consumers in London; for them, French culture symbolized social prestige. These raunchy, satirical tunes performed in the streets and at fairground spectacles in Paris helped cultivate an educated English elite—one that did not merely witness French culture at a distance, but sought to emulate the French manner through song, language, and dance.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Blood, Sweat, and Scales: The Birth of Modern Bureaucracy at the Paris Conservatoire</p>
<p class="abs-author">Diane Tisdall (King’s College London)</p>

<p>Specialized education, via the Conservatoire and other <em>écoles centrales</em>, proved a key legacy of the government in post-Revolutionary Paris. Efficient pedagogical programs, however, tend to require homogeneity and stability, neither of which was present in this period. In 1802, half of the teaching staff at the Paris Conservatoire lost their jobs. Some had held posts within the household of Louis XVI; most were over the age of fifty and with little prospect of gaining further employment. The removal of Ancien Régime stalwarts from a state-funded institution—in the same year that Napoleon installed himself as First Consul—resonates powerfully with the trope of rupture present in many histories of the Revolution. In this context, how did the Conservatoire create a training program that dominated European music education and, in the process, produce musicians capable of premiering Beethoven’s early symphonies in Paris?</p>
<p>In order to address this question, I will position the Conservatoire within historian Jerrold Seigel’s definition of a “network of means” (2012): drawing together a group of disparate people to create a benchmark of technical competence; creating social power for the network itself and (some of) the people within it. An impediment to the institution forming such a network was a group of staff—headed by teaching inspector Jean-François Lesueur—who believed that instrumental training was wrongly prioritized over that of the voice. Following the government’s intervention in 1802 their vitriolic, and public, outbursts ceased.</p>
<p>I will thus examine the pedagogical ideologies and administrative decisions that defined this crucial episode, using hitherto unexplored documents from the Conservatoire archives (minutes of staff committee meetings, correspondence between Conservatoire director Bernard Sarrette and government ministers, etc.). This new evidence questions the extent to which the teachers’ performing abilities were valued over practical concerns such as aesthetic preferences and teaching success. Indeed, it might lead us to view the Conservatoire as an advocate of pedagogical continuity rather than as a schismatic force. Ultimately, bureaucracy came to the fore: as a powerful support system for those who chose (or were selected) to work as an institutional employee.</p>
