<p class="abs-title">Temporal and Psychological Aspects of Wondrous Chromaticism in Film</p>
<p class="abs-author">Frank Lehman (Tufts University)</p>

<p>Pan-triadic chromaticism has long been enlisted by film composers to manufacture an affect of wonderment. Recent theoretical studies have approached cinematic pan-triadicism from a chiefly stylistic and/or semiological angle, often employing transformational tools. But absent from these approaches is a more general theory of how triadic chromaticism is capable of representing (and sometimes eliciting) a feeling of wonder in listeners, or the mechanism by which it dynamically influences musical expectation.</p>
    <p>This presentation provides a broader foundation for the study of wondrous chromaticism by bringing traditionally analytical questions in contact with perspectives from music cognition. I propose three modes of pan-triadic affect generation: (1) local expectancy-violation, (2) global expectancy-frustration, and (3) local frustration/global-fulfillment. The first two categories correspond closely with the psycho-physiological surprise responses of <i>frisson</i> and <i>awe</i> as characterized by Huron. The third, more dialectical mode, suggests the <i>uncanny</i>. Each category has a distinctive temporal profile. For example, frisson jolts the listener with a chromatic transformation, but soon subsides as familiar syntax reasserts itself; awe-inspiring chromaticism, by contrast, suppresses tonal teleology and opens the possibility of manipulation of subjective temporality (supported by findings of Firmino 2008 and others).</p>
    <p>The utility of these three psycho-aesthetic models of chromatic wonderment is demonstrated with case-studies from Hollywood cinema using a hybrid ITPRA/transformational methodology. Emphasis is placed on Shore’s <i>Lord of the Rings </i>scores. These analyses strive for an assimilation of cognitive and neo-Riemannian technologies, and provide ground for future research into some of the most characteristic but under-theorized music in contemporary culture.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Trancing in the Palace: Kabbalah Altered States and Morton Feldman’s <i>Palais de Mari</i> (1986)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Steven Nuss (Colby College)</p>

<p>Morton Feldman’s published writings and interviews contain frequent references to Jewish mysticism. Of the permutations of melodic cells in his <i>Patterns in a Chromatic Field</i> (1981), for example, he wrote: “It’s very related to serialism, but it’s also very related to medieval disciplines of the Kabbalah.” This paper argues that Feldman’s Kabbalah references are not just allusions to some abstract or programmatic spirituality, but are clues for new ways to think about how and why Feldman’s music does what it does, and for ways to challenge the increasingly casual characterization of Feldman’s music as “meditative,” “trance-like,” and “static” (and thus non-goal oriented and loosely organized).</p>
<p>For anyone familiar with Kabbalistic devotional practices, “serialism” and ”Kabbalah” together in Feldman’s above sentence strongly suggests <i>tzeruf</i>, an intensely physical and trance-inducing devotional practice of ecstatic Kabbalah. This paper presents an analysis of passages from Feldman’s <i>Palais de Mari</i> (1986) that demonstrates ways in which a music-analytical modeling of aspects of the devotional “mechanics” and physicality of <i>tzeruf </i>(the systematic permutation and intonation of Hebrew words and letters, controlled breathing, numerological calculations, head and hand gestures) uncovers a complex and dynamic musical and physical language in <i>Palais</i>. This <i>tzeruf</i>-inspired language features, among other things, an intricate web of numerological logic in multiple musical parameters, and what I argue is Feldman’s use of permutations of a four-note “row” that, like its twelve-tone theory relatives, often creates a strong sense of directed motion and structural articulation through aggregate completion.</p>
