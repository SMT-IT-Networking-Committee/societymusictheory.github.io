<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>Improvisation has recently garnered attention from cognitive scientists, critical scholars, and music theorists (Berkowitz 2010; Beaty 2015; Lewis and Piekut 2016; Sanguinetti 2012). Musical performance world-wide is often described as a continuum between composition and improvisation (Nettl 1974): in some practices, pieces remain relatively stable between performances; in others, there is a greater variability in the course of performance. While the notion of a continuum seems productive, the implications for cognitive processes and musical structures remain vague: this is therefore a fruitful meeting point for theorists and cognitive scientists.</p>

<p>Panayotis Mavromatis (NYU) applies Hierarchical Markov Models to transcribed improvisations from several traditions. The model accounts for structural units on various time scales that reflect cognitive constraints on the process of improvisation. Gilad Rabinovitch (FSU) provides an armchair complement to Mavromatis by analyzing the fixity and flexibility of galant schemata and their global concatenation in works by C. P. E. Bach. Janet Bourne (UCSB) discusses the shift from an improvisatory and decorative variation technique in the 18th century to a compositional approach in 19th-century variation sets. She does so through the cognitive and analytical lens of analogy. Andrew Goldman (UWO) challenges the continuum model, arguing for the importance of a typology of improvisatory processes. Through analyzing the practice of live coding, he distinguishes between “propositional” and “embodied” improvisation, and shows how improvisation types can be demonstrated and further theorized through experimentation.</p>

<p>The session is in a partially “flipped,” alternative format, and will also present discussions with additional interlocutors online ahead of the conference.</p>
