<p class="abs-title">Heinrich Schütz’s Musical Gift to the Wolfenbüttel Court: What the Partbooks Tell Us</p>
<p class="abs-author">Gregory S. Johnston (University of Toronto)</p>

<p>The Dresden Hofkapellmeister Heinrich Schütz enjoyed an enduring relationship with the court of August der Jüngere, Herzog zu Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, from the mid-1650s on. He advised the duke on a wide array of musical matters as Senior Kapellmeister <em>in absentia</em>, and provided lessons in composition to the duke’s consort, Sophie Elisabeth. As a gesture of appreciation Schütz donated copies of his printed music to the duke, and in a letter dated 10 January 1664 expressed his profound gratitude to August for according these works a place in the ducal library he rightly described as “supremely famous through all Europe.” A contemporary but undated index of the items sent by the composer was discovered in the Herzog August Bibliothek by Horst Walter in the early 1970s, allowing us to see what was sent initially by the composer and what was added later. Some alteration to the partbooks are commented on by Walter but he concludes ultimately that “the prints exhibit no traces of usage whatsoever—as if they were never used for performance.” Some of the partbooks and scores are in pristine condition, whereas others contain corrections, erasures, glued and pinned-in corrections, as well as handwritten notation and text. Several pieces in the <em>Symphoniae sacrae I</em> (1629) show where oily fingers had gripped the book and turned pages through repeated performances, others have handwritten notes at the bottom of pages to help instrumentalists avoid awkward page turns, and a trombone line became a vocal part through the addition of text. The partbooks for these works spanning Schütz’s career also suggest his close supervision of the publishing process, as varied combinations of two and even three concerting instrumental or singing voices are meticulously laid out on facing pages with perfectly coordinated page turns. Thus Schütz tells us not only which musicians will perform from a single book, he even tells us exactly where they must stand. This gift to Duke August rests quietly on the shelves of the Wolfenbüttel library, and they still have much to say about Schütz and his musical world.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Reviving <em>Messiah</em>: Handel’s 1743 Oratorio Season</p>

<p>George Frideric Handel began to prepare the upcoming London oratorio season shortly after he returned from Dublin in September 1742. <em>Samson</em> and <em>Messiah</em> were to serve as centerpieces, works as yet unheard by his hometown audience in the Lenten oratorio series. Hurdles arose almost immediately. Specifically, the present consideration of conversation, correspondence, and musical revision demonstrates that Handel struggled to secure a chorus. If the composer confronted this particular challenge only in 1743 or if it arose more frequently is unknown: limited documentary evidence and the absence of nearly all relevant performing parts result in an image of oratorio performance practice laden with gaps. These gaps include the size and makeup of the vocal ensemble. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, scholars and performers have filled in the chorus gap by adopting as normative forces the cathedral choir personnel associated with exceptional circumstances, such as the Dublin and Foundling Hospital productions of <em>Messiah</em>. As I show in this paper, however, Handel patched the chorus gap for the 1743 oratorio season in a much different manner. Unable to secure chorus singers, he implemented a makeshift solution, bolstering his five-voice cast of soloists with three additional soloists. He tasked this eight-voice ensemble with singing chorus material in addition to their various solo assignments, and strikingly, it appears chorus movements with divided vocal parts were sung in a one-voice-per-part arrangement. Thus, the “chorus” engaged for the London premiere of two of Handel’s best-known oratorios contradicts those vocal forces historically informed audiences associate with these works. Aspects of performance history and performance practice are called into question as a result—including the constitution of Handel’s vocal ensemble, duties of solo singers, and distinctions between soloists and ensemble voices—and by considering these, we achieve a fuller sense of the range of possibilities admitted by the term <em>chorus</em> in Handel’s oratorios.</p>
