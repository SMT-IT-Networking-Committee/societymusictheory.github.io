<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The past president of the College Music Society, Patricia Shehan Campbell, recently appointed a task force of eight scholars that represented various areas within the music academy. The purpose of the task force was to articulate “what it means to be an educated musician in the twenty-first century and, in turn, what recommendations may follow for progressive change in the undergraduate music-major curriculum.” The results of this task force culminated in the release of “Transforming Music Study from its Foundations: A Manifesto for Progressive Change in the Undergraduate Preparation of Music Majors.”</p>
<p>This document encourages faculty and administrators to embrace fundamental curricular change. At its heart, the <i>Manifesto</i> “takes the position that improvisation and composition provide a stronger basis for educating musicians today than the prevailing model of training performers in the interpretation of older works.” </p>
<p>While acknowledging the need to embrace curricular renovation to address the changing needs of the 21st-century music student, seven scholars who are members of both societies (SMT and CMS), including one member of the original task force, will critically examine the central tenets put forth in the manifesto and will propose a flexible vision. This re-visioning will allow individual institutions to pursue their own unique missions by offering additions or alternatives to the <i>Manifesto’s</i> “three pillars,” including curricular foci on such areas as critical thinking, entrepreneurship, collaboration, information fluency, music technology, and the preservation of past practices. </p>
