<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>It has long been understood that literacy—the ability to read and write—has the potential to re-structure consciousness: material collected in written form can be re-ordered in ways not dependent on procedures used for memorization; new kinds of forms can be created; the nature of older forms may be altered. In western European musical practice, it was in the late eighth and ninth centuries that literacy penetrated the theory and practice of music.</p>
<p>Between 1975 (Treitler, “Homer and Gregory”) and 1998 (Levy, <em>Gregorian Chant</em>), the musicological community became familiar with vigorous discussions about musical notation in this earliest period of its use: when it was invented, why it was needed, how it was used. Disagreements about how sources of chant should be brought into these discussions led to the establishment of opposed positions: on the one hand, there must have been notation available ca. 800, and on the other, extant sources did not indicate the use of notation for chant before 900. Nevertheless Treitler (1988) allowed that “the evolution of a literate musical culture” might date from before 900.</p>
<p>Papers in this session address that wider theme of musical literacy, and explore the reorganization of musical practice and intellectual understanding of music in a period of radical change. Starting from new evaluations of extant manuscripts, they argue that the ability to record musical sound in writing was only one aspect of a wider process of transformation, not only of action but also of perception. The subjection of musical knowledge to literate processes—from the analysis of sound in order to write it, to the specialized codification of specific repertories and the exploitation of writing to support new kinds of composition ( <em>prosulae</em>, sequences, tropes)—needs to be understood as a multi-layered and geographically diverse process of reconstruction. The material examined stretches from unnotated eighth-century books to detailed notations in tenth-century Old Hispanic codices, and from musical repertories made and largely transmitted orally to new genres in which literate possibilities were being discovered.</p>

<p>When did music literacy begin? That is, at what point in history did musicians first attempt to use writing to tether melody to the page? In the history of plainchant, an obvious answer comes to mind in the moment when musical notation emerged and took hold. Certainly one should not discount the change and possibility brought about by the forms of musical notation that developed during the ninth century, each type offering a variety of strategies designed to bind melody to the page in writing. But while the earliest generation of “notated” sources may be the most obvious choice for a starting point for a history of musical literacy, what of the sources of chant before the era of notation? What forms of musical literacy—if any—were at work in these “unnotated” sources and how may music writing <em>without</em> neumes have functioned to aid the learning and preservation of plainsong in specific terms?</p>
<p>This paper aims to demonstrate how the earliest sources of chant for the mass could have succeeded in stimulating melodic recall by deploying diverse kinds of written memory cues. Contemporary studies in neuroscience have shown how <em>text cues</em> are able to evoke memory of melody with astonishing accuracy by exploiting the fact that song texts (lyrics) are stored in the brain differently from ordinary, nonmusical texts. This paper will hypothesize how text cues in the earliest chant manuscripts may have used words without neumes to preserve melody with greater stability than previously thought possible. Where once the emergence of graphic notation was regarded as a game-changer (marking a shift from “pre-literate” to “literate” musical transmission), this paper moves beyond the oral/ written debate and will show how text alone could have achieved many of the same stabilizing functions as the earliest forms of musical notation. Thus, the history of musical literacy (the history of <em>written</em> transmission) can be said to begin not with neumes in the ninth century, but with different kinds of text cues found in chant books much earlier, no later than the end of the eighth century.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Remembering or Dismembering? The Implications of Written Collections for Early Medieval Trope Performance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Henry Parkes (Yale University)</p>

<p>In his investigations into early musical literacy in the 1980s, Leo Treitler repeatedly explored the possibility that tropes, unlike the Mass chants which they embellish, originated and were cultivated exclusively within a musically literate culture. His aim was to show that even a tradition “transmitted in writing from the beginning” (that is, with both text and notation) could show signs of “oral process.” Although it remains to be demonstrated that tropes actually began life in written form, surviving manuscripts from the tenth and eleventh centuries certainly suggest a tradition built upon writing: individual trope texts tend to be widely distributed and largely invariant, while scribal activity often hints at the use of hidden written intermediaries. And if the notations habitually disagree, Treitler’s point is that this is less a lapse of written control than an insight into the nature of notation. But whatever we may think of that model, it addresses only one aspect of musical literacy as it applies to tropes. This paper sets out to explore a second, whose nature is as yet unexplored: the way in which writing negotiated the critical relationship between tropes and <em>troping</em>, that is, between the individual compositions and their ultimate selection and arrangement for performance.</p>
<p>With reference both to specific manuscripts and to broader arcs of transmission, this paper contends that the rise of written trope collections in the tenth century (whether notated or not) precipitated a fundamental reconfiguration of troping as a musical practice. The central premise is that the curatorial tendencies of the early scribes (organizing, categorizing, adding rubrics) initiated a process of conceptual reification, as the written word gave an external form to previously internalized practices, thereby transforming that which the writing attempted to represent. Emergent within this process, it will be argued, was the very notion of “troping” as a distinct and shared musical tradition. Proceeding from that hypothesis, the paper will suggest new responses to certain longstanding issues in trope studies, including the notorious question of taxonomy, the apparent thinning out of repertories over time, and the very melodic variance which initially piqued Treitler’s interest.</p>

<p>The Old Hispanic chant has rarely played a role in scholarly understanding of the literate musical culture that emerged in the ninth century. Obstacles to its study have included a lack of secure dating and provenance for most manuscripts, the absence of pitched notation, and a perception that Iberia lay on the periphery of Carolingian intellectual culture. Recent developments, however, have positioned us to overcome these impediments. The fully notated León, Cathedral Archive MS 8, for example, can now be convincingly dated to between 900 and 905 (De Luca, 2015 and forthcoming), placing it chronologically closer than previously thought to the dates of the earliest fully notated Franco-Roman chant sources.</p>
<p>With the exception of the responsory verse tones (Randel, 1969), very few Old Hispanic genres have been subject to complete melodic analysis. In this paper, we show that the neumes can convey much about the Old Hispanic melodic language, even without recourse to pitch. Although few Old Hispanic chants consist of formulaic “type melodies,” we have identified hundreds of recurring neume patterns that play consistent roles in the delivery of the text and in the melodic language. Some patterns, for example, serve as cadences and others as phrase openings. Longer melismas are built in part from patterns that served consistent formal roles. Although the Old Hispanic notations have been studied from comparative and chronological perspectives (González Barrionuevo, 1995, 1997; Zapke, 2007, 2011), our study is the first to demonstrate the close relationship between the Old Hispanic notation and its melodic language. The scribes of León 8 used an extraordinary variety of notational forms that occur in specific combinations and contexts. These and other conventions of writing, including the vertical placement of neumes, make the melodic patterns immediately recognizable, serving as visual cues for melodic recall and marking specific structural points. Melodic phrase endings, moreover, are sometimes indicated by non-melodic signs underneath the chant texts. In these ways, the Old Hispanic chant bears witness to a distinctive culture of musical literacy that had taken shape in Iberia before the end of the ninth century.</p>
