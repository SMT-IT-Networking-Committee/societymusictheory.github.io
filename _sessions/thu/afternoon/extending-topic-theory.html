<p class="abs-title">The Siren <em>Topos</em>, Male Anxiety, and Female Agency</p>
<p class="abs-author">Martha E. Sullivan (Rutgers University)</p>

<p>Like the Sirens in Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>, the Siren <em>topos</em> seizes control of musical narrative; it indexes a singer’s agency and her alterity. Sirens typically offer a seductive invitation to a male character, one that dooms him if he accepts.</p>

<p>Their literary heirs include the nineteenth-century Lorelei, mermaids, undines, and Rhinemaidens. Many composers—including Felix Mendelssohn and both Schumanns—created music for these supernatural voices. A Siren’s invitation— the <em>topos</em>—consists of a leap of a seventh or more within a phrase, over a change in harmony. The motive interrupts the music, demands gesture, embodies agency. I add to classic work in topic analysis by Ratner, Allenbrook, Agawu, Caplin, and Hatten by cataloguing the Siren <em>topos</em>, not only to show its ubiquity, but also to interrogate nineteenth-century anxieties over the social role of women. Opera acts out these anxieties by killing its female characters. A feminist reading shows, however, that the female voice has agency whenever the Siren topic appears. Extending the catalogue shows the topic consistently marking invitations from such later Others as Carmen, Violetta, Lakmé, Salome, and Susannah. We also discover it in instrumental works (Ravel’s <em>Ondine</em>, Debussy’s <em>Ondine</em> and “Sirènes,” Henze’s <em>Undine</em>). The Siren even sings in popular culture, signifying the alien in the theme song to Doctor Who, or the original Star Trek main title. Always, the Siren topic asserts agency through characteristic gesture and a dangerous invitation to enter the narrative.</p>
<p>This paper invites further discussion of gendered <em>topoi</em>; embodiment; and female vocality and agency.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Octatonic and Ombra: The Russian Supernatural as a Musical Topic</p>
<p class="abs-author">Johanna Frymoyer (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Thirds-related harmonies in Russian music frequently depict the supernatural in contrast to fifths-related harmonies that correlate with the human element (Taruskin 1986). However, in passages from <em>Sadko</em> and the <em>Rite of Spring</em> where thirds-related harmonies make up the prevailing and unmarked syntax (Taruskin 1996; Van den Toorn 1987), Taruskin’s oppositional pairing seems to operate only at the generalized level of correlation (Hatten 1994); the interpretive insight these harmonies provide into expression therefore seems limited.</p>
<p>This discussion is enriched by exploring the intersection of octatonic and whole tone harmonies with musical topics (Ratner 1980) in a manner similar to <em>schema-topic amalgams</em> (Byros 2014). Examples from Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Stravinsky all exhibit features of the <em>ombra</em> topic (McClelland 2014), including repeated notes, tremolos, sudden dynamic and timbral contrasts, pedal tones, descending scales, and octave doubling. Russian composers frequently correlated <em>ombra</em> with the voice-leading schema of descending major- or minor-third interval cycles. While Taruskin identifies syntactic precedents for thirds cycles in Schubert and Liszt, I revisit this schema to illustrate its semantic dependence on the <em>ombra</em> topic.</p>
<p>Linking the expressive affect of octatonic and whole tone scales to a musical topic helps nuance the interpretive possibilities of these sonorities. A final example from <em>Sadko</em> highlights the difference between the general, unmarked octatonic harmonic language of the underwater scene and the topically marked entrance of the Sea King.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Lying About Tonality: A New World of Topic in Early Twentieth-Century Modernist Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Thomas Johnson (Graduate Center, CUNY)</p>

<p>What is a topic? Scholars of the eighteenth century offer answers in the subject’s <em>Oxford Handbook</em> (2014), but music of the twentieth century stymies such efforts by rejecting the conventionality so crucial to topics in Classic music.</p>
<p>In this paper, I tackle the notion of twentieth-century topicality directly by asserting that tonality <em>itself</em> acts as a powerful topic in modernist music and beyond, fulfilling the demanding conventionality requirement. Following Ratner’s (1980) foundational formulation, tonality seems the ultimate “subject for musical discourse” in the early 1900s. Tonality also satisfies more general definitions of semiosis. Eco (1976) claims signification occurs when there is “the <em>possibility of lying</em>,” resembling Mirka’s (2014) understanding of topics as “musical styles and genres taken out of their <em>proper</em> context and used in another one.” I suggest that modernists create conditions of possibility for “lying” about tonality by misusing it—or using it topically.</p>
<p>I abduct Rumph’s (2011) <em>figurae</em> to argue that certain non- or minimally-signifying features of tonality gain semiotic prominence in modernism. With <em>figurae</em>, I open a “world of topic” (Monelle 2006) in the twentieth century, an entangled milieu of signification that I explore with two <em>kinds</em> of analyses: of single pieces and of single <em>figurae</em>. First, I forge connective tissue between set-class (Forte 2003) and narrative (Almén 2008) analyses of Schoenberg’s op. 19/4 with my tonality-as-topic. Second, I survey a single <em>figural</em> type’s meanings through various tokens, revealing a knotted web of signification that clusters around signifieds of pastness, especially nostalgia and obsolescence.</p>


<p class="abs-title">A Topical Exploration of the Jazz Messengers’ 1963 Recording “One by One”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel J. Thompson (Florida State University)</p>

<p>In this talk, I seek to accomplish two primary objectives: (1) demonstrate the potential of adopting topic theory into the study of modern jazz and (2) offer topical and narrative analyses of “One by One”—the opening track on <em>Ugetsu: Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers at Birdland</em> (1963). My analysis frames “One by One” as a token of hard bop’s opposition to cool jazz (between east and west coasts,
respectively) in an effort to highlight the performance’s stylistic features as artifacts of hard bop’s cultural values. The opposition of “black innovation vs. white popularization” serves as an interpretive filter that links the stylistic suggestions of this specific recording with a broader cultural dialogue.</p>
<p>The vocabulary of topics from the hard bop era (ca. 1955–65) includes references to peripheral styles—most notably the blues. Though jazz has an extensive history of referencing the blues, cool jazz of the late 1940s and early 1950s marks a low point for the salience of its influence. In the mid 50s, black hard bop musicians on the east coast reemphasized the blues and other genres associated with black audiences as a direct reaction to the white popularization of cool jazz. This analysis of “One by One” depicts the stylistic confrontation of cool jazz and the blues as the crux of its narrative—conforming to a comic archetype (Frye, Liszka, Almén). Ultimately, my analysis reacts to criticisms of Almén’s theory by Michael Klein—who suggests that the <em>semantic</em> realm of musical analysis be prioritized over the <em>syntactic</em>.</p>
