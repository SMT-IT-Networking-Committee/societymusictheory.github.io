<p class="abs-title">Japan’s Messiaen: <em>Sept Haïkaï</em> and the French-Japanese Cold War Connection</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stephen Armstrong (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>On 19 June 1962, Olivier Messaen and Yvonne Loriod boarded an airplane for Tokyo, Japan, where they engaged in a month of concerts, ornithological research, and tourism that ultimately led Messian to compose his <em>Sept Haïkaï</em>. Messiaen and Loriod were immediately enamored of Japan, and they remained inveterate Japanophiles until the end of their lives. But why did Messiaen find Japan so congenial, and why were Japanese audiences so enthralled by Messiaen’s music? Messaien’s own religious self-fashioning complicates the connection; musicologists have all too frequently taken Messiaen’s extreme rhetoric at face value, as Robert Fallon has noted. Yet Fallon and others are examining the worldly engagements of Messiaen’s music, writings, and biography with increasingly critical scrutiny.</p>
<p>In this paper, I explore the complex web of political, literary, and religious connections implicated in Messiaen’s relationship with Japan. The <em>Sept Haïkaï</em> appear at the intersection of several hidden histories, including the Cold War political connections between France and Japan, contemporary literary and philosophical exchanges, and the interfaith dialogue between Catholicism and Zen Buddhism surrounding Vatican II (1962–65). By contextualizing the <em>Sept Haïkaï</em> within these wide-ranging narratives, I argue that Messiaen’s project of translating an idealized Japan into his own compositional and theological idioms positioned him within the leading edge of Catholic intellectuals and postmodern French philosophers, whose ranks include such luminaries as Thomas Merton, Alexandre Kojève, and Roland Barthes. In the same way, Japanese audiences saw Messiaen as part of an idealized French aesthetic tradition that provided an alternative to American hegemony, and the immense popularity of French writers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and François Mauriac paved the way for Messiaen’s overwhelming reception in Japan. In the <em>Sept Haïkaï</em>, Messiaen sought to translate the Shinto reverence for nature and the Zen Buddhist intuition of eternity into his own compositional and theological languages, resulting in a contemplative narrative that incorporates elements of Japanese musical structures, yet remains thoroughly grounded in Messiaen’s own avant-garde style.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Public-Private Cooperation in the Curation of America’s Musical Diversity</p>
<p class="abs-author">Danielle Fosler-Lussier (Ohio State University)</p>


<p>We frequently interpret diversity as an essential American trait. As David Nicholls has written, “If there is a single feature which both characterizes and defines American music, it is diversity.” Yet this description is not value-neutral. The United States Information Agency (USIA) framed diversity for consumption abroad, offering evidence of America’s pluralism as an analogue for all forms of equal opportunity. This presentation shows how a partnership between the State Department, USIA, a Japanese orchestra, and private patrons advanced this propaganda objective and gave female composers a way to distribute their music.</p>
<p>From 1958 to 1960, the State Department paid American conductor William Strickland to lead orchestras in Asia. Japanese orchestras played well and were inexpensive to hire, so Strickland seized the opportunity to make recordings, familiarizing Japanese musicians with American music and enhancing his own reputation. The records would also serve the State Department by conveying music to new places as gifts or propaganda (Fosler-Lussier, <em>Music in America’s Cold War Diplomacy</em>).</p>
<p>Newly examined documents at the National Archives, the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the Women’s History Archives at Smith College reveal significant private backing for Strickland’s work. Anne Hull, a pianist and personal friend of Strickland’s, used his access to the Imperial Philharmonic in Tokyo to have him record several works by female American composers: Louise Talma, Mabel Daniels, Julia Perry, Vivian Fine, and Mary Howe. Hull raised funds from the Music Committee of the National Council of Women and the National Federation of Music Clubs. The recording was distributed by the nonprofit Composers’ Recordings, Inc. (CRI).</p>
<p>The U.S. government received excellent value from this project. The USIA sent this record and many others to its Information Centers around the world. USIA’s inclusion of female composers and composers of many ethnicities, representing a surprisingly broad range of musical styles, was a strategic demonstration of diversity, articulated in the agency’s operations manual. Thus, even as the composers benefited from Strickland’s mobilization of state resources to record their works, the USIA also took advantage of private investments to promote a purposefully inclusive vision of America’s music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Music, Sound, and Nostalgia in Animated Films of Studio Ghibli</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kunio Hara (University of South Carolina)</p>

<p>The animated films of Studio Ghibli have garnered critical attention and popular embrace in Japan and, in recent years, around the globe. Responding to this trend, scholars have contributed to the growth of critical literature on the works by Hayao Miyazaki, one of the studio’s founding directors, and other Japanese animators. However, only a handful of studies have been written on the crucial role that music and sound play in these works. Drawing on Svetlana Boym’s critical framework on memory and nostalgia, this presentation attempts to address this critical lacuna by focusing on the role music and sound play in the evocation of nostalgia in four of Studio Ghibli’s film with modern Japanese settings. These films include <em>Grave of the Fireflies</em> (Isao Takahata, 1988) and <em>The Wind Rises</em> (Miyazaki, 2013), set in the years preceding and during World War II, and <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> (Miyazaki, 1988) and <em>From up on Poppy Hill</em> (Gorō Miyazaki, 2011), set in the period of rapid economic growth during the early phase of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Intertwining narratives of childhood innocence and youthful romance with the turbulent events of the twentieth century, these films recount Japan’s participation in World War II and the Cold War through intensely personal experiences of their fictional characters. Music and sound vividly convey the sense of particular times and places through diegetic insertions of mediated songs and detailed recreations of ambient sounds adding to the films’ sense of realism and immediacy. By rendering these historic experiences in largely affective terms, these film soundtracks invite the audience to process historical events as collections of personal memories instead of geopolitical struggles among the nation states. Such presentation of history obscures the larger context of World War II and, in turn, reinforces the narrative of Japan’s postwar rebirth as a nation of peace and prosperity. Thus, the music and sound of these films evoke something that straddles Boym’s categories of reflective and restorative nostalgia: soundscapes that obliquely mourn the atrocities of World War II and celebrate the more than half century of peace following it.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Was ist Japanisch?: Wagnerism and Nationhood in Modern Japan</p>
<p class="abs-author">Brooke McCorkle (SUNY Geneseo)</p>

<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, Wagner’s music and ideologies had swept across not only Europe, Russia, and the Americas, but also a very different part of the world: Tokyo. More than Beethoven or Mozart, Wagner was the composer most significant to the evolution of Japan’s imperial ideology in connection to Western music.</p>
<p>The importance of German culture began in 1868, when rebels overthrew Japan’s ruling samurai government and reinstated the imperial system. Early on, the Meiji emperor (r. 1868–1912) ended a centuries-long period of isolation. In opening its doors to the West, the country welcomed a flood of foreign technology and culture, particularly German culture. Japanese scholars went to study in Europe, most notably Berlin, planning to return home with utilitarian knowledge as well as aesthetic refinement by Western standards. While the collective goal was to fulfill the imperial slogan “rich nation and strong army,” Japanese intellectuals increasingly lost faith with the government and its promises.</p>
<p>It was in this social and political crucible that Wagner mania caught fire in Japan. Japanese Germanophiles sought to transplant Wagner’s nationalistic ideals and cultivate them to suit their own nation building. Three cases will be discussed to demonstrate the diverse ways this occurred. This is first made clear by Tokyo conservatory students’ attempt to stage <em>Tannhäuser</em>. Literature both high and low also blended Wagner and autochthonous ideals. The poet Akimoto Rofi translated and adapted the <em>Tannhäuser</em> libretto into classical poetic form for a literati journal while collections of short stories based on Wagner’s operas circulated in more popular realms. It is important to recognize, however, that Wagner’s outlook and aesthetics were emphasized more than his music, so much so that there were no complete stagings of any of his operas until the early 1940s, when both nationalism and Wagnerism reached their respective zeniths in Japan. This unique importation of Wagner to Japan has only recently been acknowledged and sheds important light on Japanese political and aesthetic culture in the long nineteenth century, leading to insights that continue to the present day.</p>
