<p class="abs-title">Denarration, Disnarration, and Impossible Fantasy in Schnittke’s Concerto Grosso No. 1
<p class="abs-author">Cara Stroud (Florida State University)</p>

<p>Around 1970, Alfred Schnittke wrote that Berio’s Sinfonia was “permeated” by “the impossibility of achieving [the] conceptual and formal perfection which had distinguished West European music of the nineteenth century.” For Schnittke, “it is impossible to bring these wonderful memories back to life.” I contemplate the degree to which Schnittke was wrestling with these same “impossibilities” in his Concerto Grosso No. 1, and I posit a narrative account that links an expressive “sigh” motive with the challenges of projecting a utopian past. </p>
<p>Schnittke wrote that descending semitones (associated with sighs) were neutralized “by a return to the initial note.” During the first three movements of the Concerto Grosso, sighing descending semitones are followed by ascending semitones that neutralize their expressive effect. The end of the fourth movement ushers in a dramatic reversal of the sigh-neutralization motive in a tonal context.</p>
<p>I apply the concepts of denarration and disnarration (coined by literary theorists Richardson and Prince and extended to postmodern music by Reyland) both to clarify and to contextualize contradictory musical events in my narrative account. I initially interpret transformation of the sigh-neutralization motive as a denarration: a new narrative (in which functional harmonic syntax presides over the alternatives provided by microcanons and tone clusters) conflicts with the previously established narrative (neutralization and disruption of Baroque-style gestures). Ultimately, tonal closure is denied, and we come to realize that the possibility of musical expression through functional harmonic syntax was instead a disnarration, an impossible fantasy of bringing tonal memories back to life.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Mahler’s Late Adagios and the “Script of Truth”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Eric Hogrefe (University of Texas at Austin</p>

<p>Perhaps more than any other composer, Mahler’s music tends to inspire interpretations that draw on concepts of narrative (see studies by Adorno, Agawu, Almén, Micznik, Monahan, Newcomb, Samuels, and others). Such an approach has the advantage of organizing Mahler’s dauntingly complex movements into clear hierarchies and/or dramatic trajectories. Yet in Mahler, the multitude of ongoing processes risks obscuring which musical parameters are more or less central to the ongoing narrative. Mahler’s symphonic writing therefore requires careful attention in order to determine which musical processes are, or are not, narrative.</p>
<p>This paper applies the notion of <i>cognitive</i> <i>scripts,</i> borrowed from cognitive narratology (Herman 2002), to Mahler’s music as a way of integrating such ongoing musical processes. Looking at two of Mahler’s late Adagio movements—the Finale of the Ninth Symphony and the first movement of the Tenth—I will argue that in each case Mahler juxtaposes one narrative thread based on musical form with another based on tonal conflict. Viewing form and tonality as scripts, or “stereotyped sequences of events,” allows us to consider narrative as arising out of musical convention, and might “help explain the difference between a mere sequence of actions or occurrences and a narratively organized sequence” (Herman 2002, 85). I argue that ultimately neither movement fully resolves the conflict between competing scripts. Analyzing these movements as manifestations of tension between two different threads explains some of their more puzzling aspects, while also reflecting Mahler’s discursive approach.</p>
