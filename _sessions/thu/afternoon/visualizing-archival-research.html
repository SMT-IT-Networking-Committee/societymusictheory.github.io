<p>Musicologists are increasingly employing methodologies from the growing
field of Digital Humanities that afford scholars different ways to analyze
sources and visualize research. These methodologies include network analysis,
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, text analysis and encoding, and
virtual reality simulations. Highlighting current examples of scholarship on
early modern Mantua and Venice, this alternative format session will focus on
three different applications of DH methods to archival materials. It will
explore how different kinds of archival sources can be analyzed digitally to
create flexible visual representations of complex and unwieldy data
collections. While archival research is certainly not new, digital approaches
allow for new perspectives on the roles of individual musicians, their
extended families and social peers, and their patrons in the larger musical
culture. </p>
<p>The session will feature three research projects that demonstrate different
approaches to archival sources in Digital Humanities. The panelists will
illustrate their presentations with discussions of the structure, appearance,
and interfaces of their on-line projects. Anne MacNeil will first present on
recent developments in IDEA: Isabella d’Este Archive
(http://isabelladeste.web.unc.edu). IDEA is an exercise in imagination,
discovery, and critical engagement: an ensemble of instruments for scholars,
students, and generally curious visitors. Taking as our inspiration and focus
one of the most influential figures of the Italian Renaissance, the Mantuan
marchioness Isabella d’Este (1474–1539), IDEA offers new ways to explore the
history and culture of early modern Italy through digital access to original
documents, artworks, and music, essays, data-mining, sound recordings, film,
and immersive environments.</p>
<p>Mollie Ables and Massimo Ossi will then discuss their complementary
research on the lives of Venetian musicians through different kinds of
archival documents. Ables’s project focuses on professional networks of
musicians, while Ossi’s traces social connections through the establishment of
kinship bonds. Sources include institutional administrative documents, such as
payment, hiring, and termination records, tourist guides published in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and pastoral records kept by
Venice’s different parishes. Both projects address issues of politics,
religion, family, society, and commerce based on information contained in
specific objects and documents.</p>
<p>Ables’s project originated as a network analysis of the musicians and
institutions surrounding Giovanni Legrenzi in his Venetian career
(http://musiciansinvenice.com/dissertation), but is now being expanded to
include more documents as they apply to other musicians. The different kinds
of sources represent the different aspects of musicians’ lives and careers
that could be documented, including their employers, their salaries, their
personal relationships, and how they were viewed by the public. The project
uses network analysis platforms to demonstrate mechanics in Venice’s musical
communities and GIS software to layer Venice’s musical culture with the
physical layout of the city. </p>
<p>Ossi’s project relies on baptismal and marriage records in the Venetian
Archivio Storico del Patriarcato. Tracing the social status, profession, and
wealth of godparents, witnesses, and others present at these rituals, as well
as the connections formed when individuals serve in such capacities multiple
times, establishes a view of Venetian society at a granular level that is
nearly impossible without digital tools for analysis and display.</p>
