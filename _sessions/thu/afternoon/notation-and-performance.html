<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>As the primary physical evidence for pre-tonal musical sound, notation has
been an essential element in the study and performance of early music. But how
fixed is the information we receive from notation? The last several decades
have increasingly explored notation not as one single teleologically
determined phenomenon but as fluid sets of conventionalized symbols, dependent
on such contexts as time, place, genre, composer or scribe, and performative
purpose for meaning. Pre-1600 conventions regarding parameters of pitch,
rhythm, time, and space therefore vary dramatically, in stark contrast to the
“lingua franca” achieved by later notational practices. What is notated, how
it is notated, and what is left un-notated all have important implications for
how early music was conceived and performed. And as “historically informed”
performers increasingly consult music theory in order to make modern
performative decisions, hermeneutic debates on notational meaning have a
stronger impact on our understanding of both historical and modern
performance.</p>

<p>In this regard, this panel, which spans well over three hundred years of
notational and theoretical materials, offers several new insights into the
intersections of notation, theory, and performance. Seeking not necessarily,
or not only, to add to the body of prescriptive knowledge about “historically
informed performance,” these five papers instead take a more postmodern
approach to early notation. Plumbing the depths of extant theoretical
material, each presenter locates clues that such sources leave us with regard
to the relationships between notation and performance and questions received
wisdom about the development of early notation itself.</p>
