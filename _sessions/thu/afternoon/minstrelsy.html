<p class="abs-title">Minstrelsy and the Yale College Man, 1845–75</p>

<p>Minstrelsy suffused Yale’s extracurricular life during the mid-nineteenth century. Students staged minstrel performances at secret society events, arranged minstrel songs for the Glee Club, purchased sheet music to play on pianos, guitars, and flutes in their dormitories, and loudly sang favorites both on and off campus. They attended minstrel shows and heard repertoire in New Haven’s billiard halls, salons, and brass band concerts. They used familiar tunes including “Dearest Mae,” “Old Black Joe,” and “O Susanna” as airs for newly composed odes for campus ceremonies, poems whose rhetorical effects and metrical rhythms demonstrate intimate familiarity with original minstrel sources. Despite Charles Hamm’s contention in <em>Yesterdays</em> that minstrelsy’s main patrons were northeastern elites, later studies by Eric Lott, Dale Cockrell, and others have instead emphasized how minstrelsy negotiated the class and racial anxieties of the white working class. Yet the pervasive and varied inclusion of minstrelsy at Yale indicates not an ironic co-option of working-class culture, but that the genre was equally integral to American upper class identity.</p>
<p>This paper illuminates minstrelsy’s pivotal role in cultivating an emergent student identity during the mid-nineteenth century that linked extracurricular song with educational philosophies of self-development. The rise of minstrelsy in collegiate life at Yale dovetailed with the importation of ideals of German student life that premised self-development on extracurricular revelry, fraternal organizations, and a blithe attitude toward coursework, forging what historian Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz has called the “college man.” Student minstrel activities as depicted in songsters, songbooks, college newspapers, and diaries exemplify the college man attitude: acting both as a vehicle for revelry and rebellion, as well as a space to demonstrate the skillfulness in Classics and rhetoric expected of educated gentlemen. Minstrelsy’s roots in charivari, combined with the genre’s growing aspirations to cultural respectability, rendered it a natural fit for the incorporation of rebellion and elite education sought by mid-nineteenth-century college students. Returning to Hamm, I conclude by arguing that situating the circulation and patronage of minstrelsy within elite social circles is necessary for a historicist approach to the complex soundscapes, economics, and ideologies of mid-nineteenth-century American musical life.</p>

<p>The late 1940s witnessed the first substantive flow of African-Caribbean migration to Great Britain. Concurrent with black settlement came the first waves of broadly accessible black music to the UK created by black Britons and African Americans alike (Oliver 1990, Stratton and Zuberi, 2014).</p>
<p>Drawing on close analysis of sound recordings and contemporaneous discourse from the pages of <em>Melody Maker</em>, <em>Musical Express</em>, and <em>Jazz Journal</em>, this paper explores three instances of black British musical production and reception in 1951: calypsonian Lord Kitchener, Trinidadian “honky tonk”/concert pianist Winifred Atwell, and jazz modernist and all-around entertainer Ray Ellington (Dawson 2011, McKay 2014). These three performers demonstrate competing models of creative production by musicians of the African diaspora, exemplifying different methods by which people of color negotiated the expectations of the British entertainment world. I contrast the reception of these three artists with jazz and blues criticism at this time, in particular the writings of Alan Lomax, Hugues Panassié, and <em>Melody Maker’s</em> Max Jones. Through this comparison, I will illustrate the ways in which pre-existing ideas about blackness and black music informed these musicians’ strategies of self-representation, their career trajectories and reception. I will also demonstrate how the embrace of “authentic” African American forms, often at the expense of other modes of black musical expression, as well as the continued employment of blackface in light entertainment, was partly driven by a growing national sense of racial anxiety due to the rapidly expanding presence of people of color in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In this paper, I will show how discourses about culturally bound expressive difference active at the time reproduced the racial logic, or “racial common sense” of a black/white binary that positioned people of color in opposition to white Britannia (Gilroy 1987/2002). I argue that the rhetorical and musical strategies employed by critics and musicians in the transatlantic flow of black genres presented black sound in a folklore-inspired, nostalgic, ahistorical manner, valuing forms that reproduced and reinforced the then-common British representations of black bodies and black expressive practices, especially those derived from the minstrel show.</p>
