<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Milanese-born cellist Angelo Maria Fiorè worked in Parma and Milan before becoming a leading musical figure in Turin. His music has clear ties to better-known Baroque cellists of Bologna, Modena, and Parma, but has never been recorded and is not widely performed. Additionally, the recent emergence of a manuscript of (mostly) cello music in Como, Italy has provided a new and significant resource for the appraisal of early Italian cello music. This manuscript, containing both cello sonatas and vocal arias with<em>violoncello obbligato</em>, became available when the archive collection <em>Fondo Raimondi-Mantica, Odescalchi,</em> currently held in the Biblioteca Comunale di Como, were opened for public viewing. Based on my arguments, I attribute at least one of the cello sonatas in the Como manuscript to Angelo Maria Fiorè, a crucial yet unheralded figure in the history of early cello music. The sonatas, brilliant and lyrical, may rank among the first works that feature the cello, while the arias weave expressive cello lines with beautiful sung texts, each musing on longing, torment, sorrow, and idealized love. While I will not perform any of the vocal works from the manuscript, I will demonstrate certain qualities of the music that contribute to our understanding of the development of cello repertoire at the end of the seventeenth century. The increased exposure of this non-standard repertoire for Baroque cello will inform public understanding of the unique role Fiorè and his contemporaries played in the cello’s musical performance and history.</p>
