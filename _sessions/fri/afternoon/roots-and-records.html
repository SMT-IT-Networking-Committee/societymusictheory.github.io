<p>This special session provides a concerted examination into ways of hearing
the musical foundations of roots-oriented genres of American music, including
folk, blues, bluegrass, Texas swing, soul, and country. The four session
papers address concepts familiar within music theory scholarship: variation,
melody, form, harmony, and rhythm. These concepts take on new meanings with a
focus on musical recordings and since the music in question has developed not
principally through music notation but through oral transmission and recorded
sound. In addition to a breadth of music theory topics, the papers consider a
wide historical sweep of repertoire, ranging from Child ballads to bluegrass
recordings from the past year. None of the repertoire featured in the session
has been theorized extensively within music theory and analysis literature,
and most of the recordings have heretofore escaped analytic attention
altogether.</p>

<p>The first paper of the session argues for the translatability of music with
roots music recordings as its examples. The following presentation further
analyzes instrumental performance practices as part of a theory of how
instrumental agency relates to form. The third paper analyzes the
transformation of harmonic language—and the disappearance of the V chord—in
“roots” cover songs. The fourth develops and extends theories of meter in its
analysis of contemporary bluegrass performances. A response then reflects on
the implications of the papers for theorizing the roots of recorded popular
music, while drawing out themes regarding how music-theoretic analysis of
roots music is woven into the cultural analysis of these scenes and
traditions. </p>
