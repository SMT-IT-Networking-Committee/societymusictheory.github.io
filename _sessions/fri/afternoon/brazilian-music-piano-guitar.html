<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Duo Rafael dos Santos and Eduardo Lobo formed in 2011 from a common
interest in research and performing the diverse spheres of Brazilian music,
from chamber music’s totally written scores to popular music and the ability
to improvise. Friends for over twenty years, Eduardo and Rafael met at the
University of Campinas’s Music Department, having previously performed
together in other settings. The duo’s first performance was at the Clube do
Choro de Paris in April 2012, at the eighth Choro Festival. They have since
been dedicated to taking the results of their work to the stage and the
studio. In 2015, they released their first CD, <i>Viajante</i>, which was
financed by the Campinas Cultural Investment Fund. In the same year they
recorded Radamés Gnattali’s Carioca Concerto no. 1 for electric guitar and
piano, with the Campinas Symphony Orchestra and conductor Victor Hugo Toro.
</p>

<p>Radamés Gnattali arose within the nationalist music scene, which, from the
1920s to the 1940s, used folklore music, almost exclusively, as the raw
material to create classical Brazilian music. In this context, his work stands
out in its use of, from the end of the 1940s, thematic material and
instrumentation found in urban music and that which was played on the radio at
the time. His work as an arranger on Brazil’s Rádio Nacional, where he worked
for thirty years since its establishment in 1936, provided him with direct
contact with popular music and important musicians in the area over the course
of many years. </p>

<p>The <i>Suite Popular Brasileira</i> for electric guitar and piano (1953) is
one of his first compositions with these characteristics. The piece was
dedicated to Laurindo Almeida, who at that time was already living in Los
Angeles, and has six movements using rhythms from popular Brazilian music
played on the radio. The instruments interact within musical textures based on
rhythmic and melodic elements, combined with a harmony that evokes popular
Brazilian music, French impressionism and jazz. </p>

<p><i>Falseta</i> (“Deceit”), written by Johnny Alf (Alfredo José da Silva), a
composer, pianist, and singer from Rio de Janeiro, was recorded in 1953.
Strongly influenced by Nat King Cole, George Shearing, and Lennie Tristano,
Alf incorporates elements of jazz in the composition that would go on to serve
as a reference in the following years for the emergence of Bossa Nova and its
instrumental version, later named “Samba-Jazz.”</p>

<p><i>Inclemência</i> is a piece of choro* music written by César Guerra-Peixe
(1914–93). As with Gnattali, Guerra-Peixe moved between many decades during
his time as a classical composer and arranger for radio and record companies.
In the 1940s, he was a student of the German musician H.J. Koellreutter, with
whom he learned how to use the twelve-tone technique.</p>

<p><i>Chorando no Alto</i> (2008) is a piece of music structured around just
one section, in which you can hear a play on musical elements from choro,
jazz, and samba. </p>

<p>In the <i>Sonatina</i> for classical guitar and piano (1957), dedicated to
the Brazilian guitarist Dilermando Reis (1916–77), we observe popular rhythms
used in a more abstract way than in the <i>Suíte Popular</i> mentioned above.
The march (I), the serenade waltz (II) and <i>Caipira</i> (Brazilian country)
music and <i>Samba-canção</i> (III) are used in a transparent musical texture
in which counterpoint lines are frequent.</p>

<p class="note">* Choro is a Brazilian instrumental genre that arose at end of the nineteenth
century, and largely employs guitars, cavaquinho, tambourine, flute, and
mandolin.</p>
