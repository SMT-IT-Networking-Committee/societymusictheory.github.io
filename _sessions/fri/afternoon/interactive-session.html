<p class="abs-title">Arrival or Relaunch? Dynamics, Orchestration, and the
  Function of Recapitulation in the Nineteenth-Century Symphony</p>
<p class="abs-author">Steven Cannon (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan)</p>

<p>Music scholars often disagree about the function of the onset of recapitulation in sonata form: some hear this event as a goal or point of arrival, while others hear it as a relaunch or new beginning. Dynamics and orchestration strongly influence which of these aspects is more salient in an individual movement. Continuity of these parameters across the formal boundary can imply the arrival function, especially if the development ends with a large-scale crescendo. A clear contrast, however, may set the recapitulation apart as something new, especially when a caesura also marks the end of development.</p>
<p>My research attempts to determine which of the two functions is more prevalent by analysing a large corpus of symphonic sonata-form movements from the 1800s. In general, the relaunch function is more common earlier in the century, whereas later works more frequently treat the recapitulatory onset as an arrival.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The <i>Ursatz</i> as Taxonomy: Examining the Song Revisions of Franz
  Liszt</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michale Vitalino (SUNY Potsdam)</p>

<p>Traditionally, Schenkerian techniques apply to a single composition. Music theorists frequently use voice-leading graphs to reveal underlying musical structure within individual compositions. However, this analytical approach is restrained by the notion that a score equals a composition in an ideal form. Although the assumption of an authoritative version often works well in music analysis, this notion is negated when a composer publishes more than one version of a work.</p>
<p>Franz Liszt’s tendency to publish revisions of his works problematizes this aforementioned notion of Schenkerian theory. Although several nineteenth-century composers produced works in multiple versions, their published versions typically supplanted the others as the definitive form. Liszt, however, frequently chose to publish more than one version of a piece, suggesting uncertainty regarding the composition’s “true” form.</p>
<p>I propose that the <i>Ursatz</i> can serve as a practical analytical tool to explicate Liszt’s revisional process. In doing so, I demonstrate how the background and middleground can serve as a basis for taxonomy in studying compositional variants. The <i>Ursatz</i>, often the abstract representation of a single piece, becomes an <i>a posteriori</i> construct in comparative analysis that reveals discernible relationships among a group of works. By expanding Schenker’s concept of the <i>Ursatz</i> to accommodate an inter-compositional framework, a three-part taxonomy results: directly related revisions that share a common foreground and background structure; moderately related versions that feature deep structural similarities in contrapuntal design despite foreground alterations; and independent settings that share no common material on any structural level of analysis.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Bartók’s Second String Quartet: Morphisms of Motivic
  Trees</p>
<p class="abs-author">James N. Bennett (University of Wisconsin-Madison)</p>

<p>This presentation builds on the ideas introduced in my paper “The Transcendental Logic of Musical Trees,” read at SMT 2013 (Charlotte). In addition to further formalizing the construction of motivic trees, I propose a method for arranging them into meta-trees, allowing one to relate several motives within a single work. In the same way that musical motives are often understood either as (1) sets of discrete forms (Lewin’s S), or (2) gestalts without clear boundaries (Hanninen’s “associative sets”), motivic trees can be characterized mathematically as (1) partially ordered sets (with inherent semigroups generated by the join operation), or (2) “Alexandrov” spaces, topologies in which the open sets are the lower sets. In the first case, the morphisms relating two trees would be monotone functions, while in the second they would be continuous maps. In an effort to reconcile these two perspectives — which could be called “mechanistic” and “dynamic” — I consider the category-theoretic duality of partial orders and Alexandrov spaces. Since my initial inspiration was Béla Bartók’s evolutionary model for the rhythms and melodic patterns of Hungarian folk music, I present several meta-trees derived from the first movement of Bartók’s Second String Quartet (1915-1917), which is often described as expressing a bewildering web of motivic relations. Depending on whether one wishes to conceive of the motives themselves as sets or gestalts, such meta-trees can be understood as relating motivic trees through either monotone functions or continuous maps.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Metric Ambivalence and Flow in Rap Music: A Corpus-Assisted
  Analysis of OutKast’s <i>Mainstream</i> (1996)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Mitchell Ohriner (Shenandoah University)</p>

<p>Research into rap’s flow by scholars including Adam Krims, Noriko Manabe, Kyle Adams, and Adam Bradley addresses how MCs place syllables, accents, and rhymes at certain metric locations to bolster or complement the meter of the (often sampled) instrumental beat. For example, many consecutive rap lines retain similar accent contours and end rhymes. This coordination between the meter of the beat and the rhythmic features of the rapping depends on the beat maintaining a single, stable meter. In Outkast’s “Mainstream” from 1996, the instrumental beat contains both a clear triple meter in the guitar parts and a clear duple meter in the drum set. The MCs on the track (Khujo Goodie, T-Mo Goodie, André 3000, and Big Boi) must negotiate this metric difference. Drawing on models of rhythm in speech and music, I demonstrate how an MC might support one metric hearing or another. Specifically, through reiterated accentual patterns and three-beat durations between rhymes, T-Mo Goodie aligns more consistently with the triple meter of the guitar while André 3000 aligns with the duple meter of the drum set. Through a larger empirical study of the output of these two MCs, I also how T-Mo Goodie’s performance practice enables him to more readily integrate metric difference. By examining flow in a rare track without an unadorned duple meter, I hope to elaborate analytical descriptions of the ways MC’s can interact with the meter of rap music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Oops!... I Did It Again: Max Martin’s Complement Chorus.</p>
<p class="abs-author">Megan Lavengood (CUNY Graduate Center)</p>

<p>Max Martin, a pop producer prolific in the late 90s and early 2000s, implemented an idiosyncratic formal unit in his turn-of-the-millennium singles performed by the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, and Britney Spears. This unit, which I call the <i>complement chorus</i>, is recognizable based on distinct features of the chorus itself and its placement within the overall form of the song. The complement chorus is clearly marked as a chorus variant, using the same orchestration, harmony, and lyrics as the chorus, but introduces a new melodic line with a different rhythmic profile than the original chorus. A track using the complement chorus will have a chorus that is rhythmically gapped; the complement chorus in turn uses an opposing rhythmic profile that fills in these gaps. The complement chorus is always first presented after the bridge. In subsequent repetitions of the chorus, the complement chorus is layered over the regular chorus, creating a cumulative chorus. The result of layering these two melodies in the cumulative chorus is quasi-contrapuntal, with a hocket-like rhythmic profile between the two lines. This formal unit is part of Martin’s idiolect around the turn of the millennium and can perhaps be considered a kind of schema for his singles.</p>

<p>A cappella choral singing is increasingly popular among American teenagers. Following on recent commercial successes of TV shows (The Sing-Off), movies (Pitch Perfect), and performing groups (Pentatonix) with the students in my undergraduate music theory classes, I have developed a unique vocal jazz unit which provides students with valuable skills presented in the fun and challenging context of a cappella choral singing. This poster shares the goals, instructional methods, and large-scale project associated with this unit.</p>
<p>This unit, which takes place during the final semester of our core Theory and Aural Skills course sequence, evolved out of my desire to incorporate jazz harmony into our undergraduate core curriculum. The goals of this unit are twofold: (1) familiarity with common jazz chords, nomenclature, and arranging techniques, and (2) singing close harmonies without instrumental support. Goal 1 includes topics like extended tertian harmonies, reading chord symbols from a lead sheet, and so forth; Goal 2 sees students vocally improvising guide tone-like lines for ii-V-I progressions and creating accompaniments for standard tunes.</p>
<p>The unit culminates in a Vocal Jazz Project. Each student is assigned a standard tune and assigned to a quintet. They are asked to create a notated five-voice a cappella arrangement, following the guide tone method used in Aural Skills classes and incorporating the arranging techniques discussed in Theory classes. The students create their own arrangements, run rehearsals, and eventually perform their arrangements for the entire class.</p>
