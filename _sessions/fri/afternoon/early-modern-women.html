<p class="abs-title">More Than a Pretty <em>violeta</em>: Santa Caterina de’ Vigri’s Contributions to Renaissance Musical Culture</p>
<p class="abs-author">Eleonora Beck (Lewis &amp; Clark College)</p>


<p>Little musicological attention has been paid to Santa Caterina de’ Vigri (1413– 63). Scholars most frequently mention her in connection with a fifteenth-century fiddle called a <em>violeta</em>, housed in the Corpus Domini monastery in Bologna, where she served as abbess. Livia Caffagni has researched her works and has recently paired Saint Catherine’s lauds texts to laudas found in fifteenth-century manuscripts, recording them with her group laReverdie. An examination of biographies of Caterina and her own narratives and poetry suggest that she made important contributions to the musical culture of Renaissance Bologna. For instance, Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti in his <em>Gynevera de le clare donne</em> (1490), which contains the longest and most comprehensive biography of Caterina, recounts the story of her singing and accompanying herself on her <em>violeta</em>. Caterina’s numerous published narratives, including <em>I dodici giardini</em> and the <em>Sette armi spirituali</em>, mention music making and contain her original lauda texts.</p>
<p>This paper sheds light on Caterina’s musical aesthetic through a new reading of Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti’s <em>Gynevera de le clare donne</em> (1490) and an analysis of her narratives with interpolated laudas. It will be argued that Caterina incorporates music into her stories in much the same manner that Boccaccio did in his <em>Decameron</em>, a text she likely read when she studied in the D’Este library as a young girl in Ferrara. Not only are Caterina’s narratives interspersed with poetry, the poetry itself praises the practice of singing and dancing—and like members of the <em>brigata</em>, Caterina sings and accompanies herself on the fiddle. In borrowing from Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron</em>, Caterina bridges the divide between sacred and secular musical spaces, and in this paper I argue that Caterina is an important figure in the flourishing Italian humanist tradition, later championed by Bembo, another Boccaccio imitator, who embraced music when cultivated in a tempered manner.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The First Songstress: The Fragmented History of Lucia Quinciani’s Monody of 1611</p>
<p class="abs-author">Seth Coluzzi (Boston, Mass.)</p>

<p>When Lucia Quinciani released her musical setting of the text <em>Udite, lagrimosi</em> in 1611, she became the first female composer to publish a solo song, the sixth woman to print music of any kind, and the first Veronese musician to issue a setting from Battista Guarini’s fashionable and controversial play, <em>Il pastor fido</em> (1589). The piece appeared in the second volume of <em>Affetti amorosi</em> of Marc’Antonio Negri, a singer and composer at the Verona cathedral, with a caption that identifies Quinciani as both Negri’s student (<em>discepola</em>) and as a “signora,” denoting a lady of noble standing. Yet in spite of its notable historical position, Quinciani’s sole surviving work has received scant scholarly attention. On the face of it, this neglect seems to be for good reason, for the work shows glaring deficiencies in its text, ending, and large-scale handling of mode.</p>
<p>But what remains for us in the printed music may not be the end of the story for Quinciani’s lament. Indeed, this study into the song’s music, text, and contexts in Negri’s <em>Affetti amorosi</em> reveals the unusual circumstances that intervened between the work’s composition and its emergence in print, and offers several scenarios for why they occurred, including social, musical, and print-related considerations. The results offer a novel example of how the constraints of music printing and the dynamics between teacher and pupil might have impinged on a composer’s work in the early Baroque. They also demonstrate how Quinciani’s own compositional interests grew out of the shifting musical currents of early seventeenth-century Verona.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Women, Urban Experiences of Music, and the Inquisition in the Early Modern Iberian World</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ascensión Mazuela-Anguita (Spanish National Research Council)</p>

<p>The records of the Spanish Inquisition are important sources to discover details of daily life and, in particular, to catch a glimpse of female musical activities, which are rarely present in other documents traditionally used by musicologists. Inquisitional witchcraft and heresy trials often involved women who sang, danced, and played musical instruments. These documents show how these women’s music-making was considered morally dubious, and it coincides with the restrictive recommendations found in guides to female behavior published in early modern Spain, in which their music-making was censured. However, Inquisitorial documents also provide clues as to women’s informal music education, and allow us to assess the important role played by Iberian women in the creation, performance, teaching, patronage, and transmission of music and musical artifacts.</p>
<p>The Inquisition considered that the association between (low and middle-class) women and (secular) music was immoral; at the same time, this institution used music as a symbol of its power and as a means of Catholic indoctrination in urban rituals termed <em>autos de fe</em>, in which Inquisition prisoners showed repentance for their sins and were reconciled to the Catholic faith. As a complement to violence and public punishments, the variety of musics and sounds (noise, explosions, heraldic instruments, penitential texts) in these communal actions had the purpose of inspiring devotion and fear. Music formed part of a sensorial reality which involved those who were present emotionally and made them active participants in the dramatic event through the chanting of melodies that were familiar to all.</p>
<p>This paper re-examines, from a musicological point of view, Inquisitional records, <em>relaciones</em> (a literary genre considered to be a predecessor of the press in which a special event is related), musical iconography, and treatises on demonology in order to assess, through particular case studies, the place occupied by music in the Inquisition’s agenda and in the popular culture of the period. The Inquisition’s approaches to music reveals a dichotomy between the earth (represented by popular music, dance, and sexuality, and related to women and immorality) and the celestial paradise (the choirs of angels, of which devotional music was considered a faint echo).</p>


<p class="abs-title"><em>Pretiosissimo sangue</em>: Giulio Strozzi and the <em>Sacri musicali affetti</em> (1655)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sara Pecknold (Catholic University of America)</p>

<p>On 1 January 1650—the Feast of the Circumcision—Venetian poet Giulio Strozzi wrote his final will. Eschewing conventional legal formulae and rendering the document in a large, scrawling hand, Giulio concluded with a surprisingly earnest supplication: “I commend [my soul] to God, who created it, and who bought it with his <em>pretiosissimo sangue</em>, so that I still hope to see . . . salvation</p>
<p>. . . not for my merits, but for His infinite mercy.” Upon Giulio’s death in 1652, his adopted (and possibly illegitimate) daughter—the prolific composer Barbara Strozzi (1619–77)—was recognized as his sole heir. Three years later, Barbara issued her fifth and only sacred opus—the <em>Sacri musicali affetti—</em>a print comprising fourteen stunningly virtuosic motets for solo voice and continuo. Although Ellen Rosand’s 1988 facsimile made the music widely available, the <em>Sacri musicali affetti</em> have received relatively little scholarly attention. Robert Kendrick’s 2002 article unearthed the significance of <em>caritas</em> and liturgical intertextuality as the keys to understanding Barbara Strozzi’s sacred music; however, there is a great deal more to be explored in regard to the <em>Sacri musicali affetti</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps no aspect of Strozzi’s fifth opus deserves more attention than the significance of the Christological motets in light of the composer’s relationship with her father. In this paper, I will argue that there are deep resonances between Giulio Strozzi’s final will and the <em>Sacri musicali affetti</em>. In fact, the inclusion of <em>Oleum effusum</em> to the Most Holy Name of God suggests a new interpretation of the print itself as a votive offering for Giulio’s soul. I will illustrate this by investigating devotional practices to the Blessed Sacrament and to the <em>pretiosissimo sangue</em> in Venice and nearby Mantua—practices in which Strozzi’s dedicatee, Anna de’ Medici, participated. I will then examine the motets’ liturgical intertextuality alongside Strozzi’s musical response to the text. Finally, I will consider the significance of Giulio’s burial in the chapel of the Madonna della Pace in the Dominican church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, and the possibility that Giulio himself was a member of the confraternity of the Name of God.</p>
