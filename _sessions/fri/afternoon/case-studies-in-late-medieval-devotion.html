<p class="abs-title">The Dramatic Sequence of the Wilton <em>Visitatio sepulchri</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Alison Altstatt (University of Northern Iowa)</p>

<p>For six centuries, the convent of Wilton Abbey was the premiere school of Latin learning and literary composition for English women of noble birth. Little direct evidence remains, however, of its literary, ritual, and musical culture. The sole notated manuscript known from Wilton, a fourteenth-century processional, was hand copied at Solesmes Abbey ca. 1860, but subsequently disappeared. My recent identification of thirty-four leaves of the original manuscript represents the recovery of significant textual and musical evidence from the Wilton liturgy. The leaves also provide a means by which to assess the Solesmes transcription, rendering it more useful as a surrogate for those leaves still missing.</p>
<p>The manuscript’s <em>Visitatio sepulchri</em> Easter play occurs at the height of a dramatic cycle that spans from Palm Sunday to Pentecost, during which time the abbey symbolically transformed into the city of Jerusalem. In a section of the <em>Visitatio</em> that Susan Rankin has described as unique to Wilton, two musically connected scenes comprise a dialogue in the form of a sequence. I will consider how common concerns of sequence texts—the bridging of time, space, social division, and gender—apply to the dramatization of the Wilton <em>Visitatio</em>. Through melodic analysis, I will show how the parallel form of the sequence is inflected to amplify the text, intensifying the sorrow and joy expressed by the Three Marys at the tomb. I will furthermore suggest that departures from and adherence to the parallel form of the sequence reflects the women’s progression from ignorance to the knowledge of the resurrection, and a growing spiritual alignment between Mary Magdalene and Christ.</p>
<p>Finally, I describe how the cantrices of Wilton are musically integrated into the <em>Visitatio</em> as participants and narrators who observe and comment on the encounter between Mary Magdalene and Christ. This unique dramatic application of the sequence bespeaks a musical culture at Wilton that was sophisticated, dramatically subtle, and rich in liturgical symbolism. This study adds to our knowledge of the literary, ritual, and musical culture of Wilton Abbey and contributes an important case study to the fields of English monastic chant and medieval women’s composition and performance.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Artful Sequence: Texts, Music, and Decoration among Fourteenth-Century German-Speaking Dominican Nuns</p>
<p class="abs-author">Margot Fassler (University of Notre Dame)</p>

<p>The liturgy of the Friars Preachers was standardized by Humbert of Romans in the mid-thirteenth century and was carefully copied for use by Dominicans from that time forward, with local variation often kept to a minimum. There are some exceptions to this widespread liturgical uniformity in both the Office and the Mass. Perhaps the most important sources for the study of change and geographical distinctiveness are the sequence repertories, both of male and of female Dominican houses. Of graduals with sequences copied by or belonging to Dominican women, only that from St. Katharinenthal in Diessenhofen has been much studied.</p>
<p>This paper broadens out the work to include sequentiaries from Unterlinden, Altenhohenau, Cologne, and Paradies bei Soest and is the first comparative study of this repertory. My analysis of five sequence repertories demonstrates that Dominican women were exceedingly creative in their responses to various calls to upgrade feasts of both the temporale and sanctorale, adding many new works that they seemingly wrote the texts for themselves. Several of the new works are contrafacta, and the women were often masterful in their settings of new texts to preexisting melodies. Some of the melodies are probable unica and may have been composed by the women. Knowledge of Latin among poets for the new sequences was at a high level, the texts challenging the idea that women were generally unlearned in the region in this period. The artwork decorating the gradual from Katharinenthal in the early fourteenth century is well known. Less so is the intricate and learned work of the nuns of Paradies bei Soest in Westphalia, whose work includes hundreds of interwoven commentaries. At the close of my paper, I offer a summary of the ways in which the nuns themselves planned out and rendered the decoration of their sequence repertory. I focus on select Marian chants from Düsseldorf, Universitäts-und Landesbibliothek, Cod. D 11, a gradual with sequentiary from around 1380, placing the repertory, its decoration, and microinscriptions in the context of the several chant repertories mentioned above. This study is part of a forthcoming book written by a team of four authors from the U.S., Germany, and Switzerland.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Making Sense of the Sequence at Pistoia</p>
<p class="abs-author">James Maiello (University of Manitoba)</p>

<p>Scholars have found cohesion in the musical and textual styles of northern sequence repertories like those at St. Gall and St. Martial de Limoges. Italian musicians, however, approached the sequence differently than their Frankish colleagues, treating the genre with considerable flexibility and irregularity in both text and music. Because of these stylistic idiosyncrasies, musicologists, until relatively recently, often treated Italian sequences as peripheral to the study of the genre. Indeed, Bruno Stäblein even went so far as to call the Italian approach a “degeneration of the sequence principle” itself !</p>
<p>In this paper, I will use the sequence repertory of the Tuscan cathedral of San Zeno, Pistoia to contest the view that Italian sequences and repertories show a fundamental lack of cohesion. Instead, I will argue that although it was heterogeneous, stylistically, San Zeno’s sequence repertory was unified by the ways the cathedral community employed the sequence to assert its power and prestige. For example, I suggest that certain melodies, most notably the ubiquitous “Concordia,” were used as signifiers of importance. I also argue that a Pistoiese cleric composed a unique sequence for Epiphany to reinforce episcopal authority, tailoring both words and music to that purpose. Finally, the cathedral chapter also seems to have used non-standard and “imported” items to distinguish San Zeno from its neighbors and to identify the institution as a sophisticated, cosmopolitan one.</p>
<p>This sequence repertory solidified at San Zeno in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, a period during which the cathedral chapter and its bishop struggled to achieve independence from the imperial party and to assert their supremacy in the face of a nascent communal government. Within the context of Pistoia’s local and regional culture, then, one finds unity and cohesion not in musical and textual style, but rather in how San Zeno’s ecclesiastical community used the genre to assert power and hegemony. In exploring this line of inquiry, I will provide a valuable case study and an additional methodological model for examining Italian sequence repertories.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Nordic Cult Building through Music and Ritual: Mary’s Suffering Heart and the Office Stabat Virgo Dolorosa</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michelle Urberg (University of Chicago/Pacific Lutheran University)</p>

<p>The music and ritual for the feast of the Compassion of Mary developed in the devotional milieu of the rhymed office in the late Middle Ages (Hughes, Nilsson). It was celebrated on a variety of different days, mainly during Eastertide, from Italy to Scandinavia. Despite wide interest in venerating Mary’s encounter with the suffering and death of Christ, however, this liturgy was not regularized. It lacked a standard set of offices or other devotions, disseminated from major cultic centers, such as Paris (Fassler, Anderson). Yet, archeological evidence of a fifteen-station procession honoring Mary’s co-suffering suggests that one important regional center developed before 1470 at the powerful double (female and male) Birgittine house, Vadstena Abbey, in Sweden. The evolution of this cult can be traced to standardizing one important office—<em>Stabat Virgo Dolorosa</em>—which originated at Vadstena in the brothers’ cloister around 1440. This paper reveals the particular compositional practices of the Birgittine brothers—namely, their reworking of older materials to create a network of musical and textual relationships for <em>Stabat Virgo</em>—which normalized this office and laid the liturgical foundation for the Nordic cult for the Compassion of Mary.</p>
<p>Two notated manuscripts made at Vadstena—Uppsala University Library C21 and C23—delineate how the brothers created relationships with previously existing chant texts and melodies. All chants for <em>Stabat Virgo</em> are based on those in the <em>Cantus Sororum</em>, the sisters’ exclusive weekly office inspired by texts written by the Order’s founder, St. Birgitta. The responsories were specifically adapted from those unique to the sisters’ Friday office by shortening their melodies, disordering their modal assignments, and rhyming their texts. New hymn texts were set to the hymn melody in the Friday office, which was originally associated with another feast, for the True Cross. The brothers thus used deliberate compositional strategies to infuse <em>Stabat Virgo</em> with texts influenced by Birgitta and melodies of chants from Vadstena. These choices promulgated <em>Stabat Virgo</em> throughout Sweden with Birgittine words and sounds. The resonances were strong: pilgrims from throughout Europe soon flocked to venerate Mary’s suffering heart at Vadstena Abbey.</p>
