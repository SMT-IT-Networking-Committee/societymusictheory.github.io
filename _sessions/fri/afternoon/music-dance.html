<p class="abs-title">Three Sailors, Three Musical Personalities: Choreo-musical
  Analysis of the Solo Variations in Fancy Free</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rachel Short (University of California, Santa Barbara)</p>

<p>The ballet <i>Fancy </i>Free premiered at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1944, marking the beginning of the creative collaboration between composer Leonard Bernstein and choreographer Jerome Robbins. This paper presents a choreo-musical analysis of the ballet<i> </i>exploring the intertwining relationships between music and dance. I argue that the complementary metric and rhythmic choices create unique characterizations for each of the three sailors’ solo variations in the sixth movement. The placement and repetition of rhythmic and choreographic phrases<i> </i>distinguish the personalities of each sailor.<i></p>
<p></i>Building on recent discussions by music theorists and dance scholars, my analysis aligns the dance steps alongside musical analysis to see how they inform each other, paying close attention to choreographic and musical accents. The energetic first variation features the acrobatic, gregarious sailor, and the tension between choreographic and musical phrases depicts a man of vigor. I focus on the second variation, which while titled “Waltz” is not in a pure triple meter. I illustrate how the choreography can confirm or contradict the waltz topic, portraying the sailor’s unassuming playfulness. The third movement is the most metrically straightforward and the choreography matches effortlessly with the main motives, providing a slick characterization for the group’s suave leader. I take this in-depth look at the Fancy Free variations to illustrate how choreo-musical analysis can enrich our understanding of the synergy of music and movement.</p>

<p class="abs-title">In the French Style: Metric Types and Embodied Meaning in
  Tchaikovsky’s <i>Sleeping Beauty</i></p>

<p>This paper addresses the expressive coordination of dance and music in excerpts from the 1889 ballet <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>. Examining Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s score and the Stepanov notation of Marius Petipa’s original choreography, I consider how we perceive expressive meaning through the conceptual blend of bodily and musical rhythms. My study focuses on examples of what William Rothstein (2008, 2011) calls the “Franco-Italian” metric type. I employ Christopher Hasty’s model of anacrustic hearing (1997) to clarify the particular <i>rhythmic feeling</i> of this end-accented phrase rhythm, and to demonstrate how it affords a distinctive quality of movement. Through the metaphorical mapping of metrical accent and physical weight, Petipa and Tchaikovsky exploit “Franco-Italian” meter’s potential for embodiment to expressive ends.</p>
<p>I introduce the “Franco-Italian” metric type through two excerpts associated with Prince Désiré—characterized by the topical field of the <i>hunt</i>—before moving to a more detailed analysis of the “Bluebird” <i>pas de deux</i> from Act III. I argue that the conceptual blending of Petipa’s choreography and Tchaikovsky’s music in <i>Variation 1</i> and the <i>Coda</i> from this <i>pas</i> suggests a “Franco-Italian” hearing and performance. This salient combination of metric orientation and virtuosic dancing characterizes Petipa’s choreographic depiction of the eponymous French fairy tale— wherein the enchanted Bluebird teaches Princess Florinne to <i>fly</i>. In the case of both Prince Désiré and the Bluebird, the French style of phrase rhythm palpably enriches our experience of musical meaning.</p>
