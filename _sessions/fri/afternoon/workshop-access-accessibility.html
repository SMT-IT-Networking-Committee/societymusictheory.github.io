<p>When we think of accessibility, we often think first of the very necessary
and often insufficient accommodations for people with physical impairments.
The AMS has previously sponsored a number of panels on issues surrounding
disability, some of them dealing with accessibility questions. This workshop
continues the discussion, broadening it out to think about a variety of kinds
of accessibility, particularly as they intersect with gender. It begins with a
short panel discussion that features people who have experienced a variety of
barriers to accessibility, responding to a focused set of questions about
their experiences with the AMS and the field of musicology more broadly. The
workshop will also break up into small groups that will discuss what the
panelists have said in order to propose concrete (and perhaps some
not-so-concrete) ways in which the AMS and its members can help all people
feel welcome and included in the Society. </p>

<p>Our definition of accessibility is broad, encompassing a variety of kinds
of barriers experienced by people (often but not always disproportionately
female) who would like to be more involved in the life of the Society, but who
find that difficult. These barriers include: </p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  <li>Physical and cognitive barriers: getting to and moving around
    conference venues and their surroundings, or seeing and hearing
    presentations; physical and cognitive impairments that make career progress
    slow and that may indirectly make the AMS less accessible. </li>
  <li>Financial barriers: affording membership, conference fees, safe
    accommodation at conferences for those particularly vulnerable, caretakers
    (or on-site child care), scholarly resources including travel, libraries and
    databases, and other scholarly necessities. </li>
  <li>Professional-status barriers: those not currently employed full-time
    as musicologists, those carrying a high teaching load, and those who for
    various other reasons feel professionally isolated or undervalued may
    experience the AMS as unwelcoming. </li>
  <li>Family barriers: parenthood is the obvious challenge, particularly
    when children are very young, but caring for other loved ones can present
    temporal, financial and social barriers to access. Much family labor falls
    disproportionately on women. Single parents and older people looking after
    aging parents may be particularly vulnerable to losing touch with the Society.
  </li>
  <li>Identity barriers: the AMS can be an unwelcoming place for people with
    a variety of identities that do not fall into the cis-gender, largely white
    categories which form the majority of the AMS membership. </li>
</ol>

<p>We hope that our panelists will discuss these issues from their own
experience. In addition, we plan to solicit a number of short narratives from
members and ex-members of the Society at large; these narratives will inform
the questions we ask the panelists. Some of these narratives may be read out
loud by members of CWG during the workshop to give voice to this important
constituency. Both the panelists and those submitting narratives will be
invited to propose an action or a change that would make their access to the
life and benefits of the Society easier. </p>
