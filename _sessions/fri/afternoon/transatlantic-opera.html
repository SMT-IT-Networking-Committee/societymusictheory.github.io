<p class="abs-title">Transatlantic <em>grand opéra</em>: Rethinking the Théâtre d’Orléans</p>
<p class="abs-author">Charlotte Bentley (University of Cambridge)</p>

<p>Patronized by a wide cross-section of the city’s population, the Théâtre d’Orléans occupied a fundamental role in New Orleans’s social and cultural life between 1819 and 1859. It was widely celebrated as a source of high-quality francophone entertainment, boasting a troupe recruited from Europe each year. This was the first (and, for a long time, the only) permanent opera company in North America and, through a series of summer tours, it played a key role in introducing French opera to the eastern seaboard of the United States. While operatic performances in the theater’s early years were almost exclusively of <em>opéras-comiques</em>, from the late 1830s it was fêted for its lavish and novel productions of Paris’s most popular <em>grands opéras</em>.</p>
<p>This much is relatively well known, and aspects of the theater’s repertoire, the critical reception of certain works, and the scope of the troupe’s tours have already been explored to varying extents. Remarkably little attention has been paid, by contrast, to the way in which opera in New Orleans fitted into wider transatlantic networks, or to the systems, materials, and people that allowed these performances to take place.</p>
<p>By combining archival research in both France and the US, my paper will therefore elucidate the processes involved in bringing <em>grand opéra</em> to New Orleans. Through an exploration of the intricate relationship between the theater and operatic Paris, not least between the theater’s director Pierre Davis and Meyerbeer, I will examine the lengths to which the Théâtre d’Orléans went to recreate the experience of Parisian <em>grand opéra</em> across the Atlantic, while adapting it for local conditions and tastes. I will suggest that the growing ambition of such productions also inspired more elevated aesthetic discourse around opera in the city, as in the critical reception of <em>Les Huguenots</em> after its American premiere in 1839. Adopting such an approach can help us to move beyond the traditional image of New Orleans as a “special case” in the development of operatic culture in the US, and enables us to reconfigure our understanding of the history of opera in the city within a transnational context.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Adaptation in English Opera: New Light from the Norwich Theatre Royal Music Collection, Norfolk Heritage Centre</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rachel Cowgill (University of Huddersfield)</p>

<p>Examination of a neglected collection of 185 early nineteenth-century music prints and manuscripts deposited at the Norfolk Heritage Centre reveals it to be of considerable national importance, containing unique or rare items and being one of only a few survivors of the fires that destroyed many British theatre-music archives of the period. This paper investigates the manuscript scores and sets of parts for operatic material apparently arranged and adapted by Charles Henry Mueller, a London-based flautist and violinist who moved to the Theatre Royal Norwich around 1823. Mueller’s manuscripts, which suggest he was a remarkably energetic ensemble leader, include full-score versions of English operas that have not otherwise survived—some Don Juan burlesques, for example—as well as a manuscript score of the first English-language adaptation of Mozart’s <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>, among other Continental works, which was presented at the Theatre Royal Norwich in 1829 and preceded by a decade the Drury Lane production generally acknowledged to be the first English-language performance. Mueller also notated full scores of works that otherwise exist only in printed vocal scores with piano arrangement of the orchestral texture. These include operas by Dibdin, Shield, Mazzinghi, Storace, Arnold, Bishop, and others, as well as music for ballets, balls, and other entertainments given at the Theatre Royal in the 1820s and ’30s.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen increased musicological interest in the adaptation of operas for the early nineteenth-century English stage, including Fuhrmann’s <em>Foreign Opera at the London Playhouses</em> (2015), but research into English theatre music of the period has been hampered generally by a lack of full scores (only a handful are currently known). As the paper will show, by discussing the content and provenance of selected Mozart-related items from the collection, the cataloguing and assessment of the Norwich material facilitates a deepening understanding of adaptation processes in English opera, as well as offering the potential to inspire stage revivals.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Performing National Identity: Francis Hopkinson and the First Productions of Serious Opera in Colonial America</p>
<p class="abs-author">April Greenan (University of Richmond)</p>

<p>Among the earliest productions of serious opera in the American colonies were two works performed in Philadelphia, the “Athens of America,” in 1757 and 1781 respectively. Philadelphia-born Francis Hopkinson was involved in the creation and performance of both works. The first production was a reworking of the masque <em>Alfred</em>, originally by James Thomson and David Mallet with music by Thomas Arne. William Smith, who collaborated on the new libretto, explained that the ninth-century English monarch was “a finished Pattern of true heroism and diffusive Virtue” (<em>Pennsylvania Gazette</em>, 20 January 1757) to whose eighteenth-century counterpart the colonies were wholly allegiant. Indeed, Smith’s new lines of text extended the hermit’s prophecy of “the future Greatness of England so far as to include these Colonies.”</p>
<p>While the allegorical character of the Genius of Britain appears in <em>Alfred,</em> it is the Genius of France that figures into the 1781 production of Hopkinson’s <em>America Independent, or The Temple of Minerva</em>. At a pivotal point in the American Revolution, this work celebrated the alliance of French and rebel forces that, together, are guided by Minerva herself toward enlightened liberty and republicanism. Minerva’s High Priest now foretells a future for the colonies not only independent of but also antithetical to British rule.</p>
<p>The first American essays in European serious opera illustrate the fluidity of the national identity it became Hopkinson’s purpose to define. Heretofore, Hopkinson’s reputation and relevance have remained tightly bound to Oscar Sonneck’s century-old epithet that Hopkinson was America’s “first poet-composer.” New research situates Hopkinson in his larger and more critical role as an indispensible figure in the nation’s founding, which role even exceeded in a diverse and remarkable career his signing of the Declaration of Independence. Additionally, Hopkinson is now considered one of the most important American writers of his age. He mastered social media of the day and was committed to shaping a national culture through the press and through material objects emblazoned with emblems of state that he designed. Hopkinson’s dramatic works and other musical compositions appear in a new light as prescriptions for and descriptions of a new, calculated American character.</p>



<p class="abs-title"><em>Vive la France! Vive la Révolution!</em> . . . <em>à New York</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Jennifer C. H. J. Wilson (Brooklyn College)</p>

<p>After news reached New York of the 1830 July Revolution in Paris, new works, events, and celebrations were immediately organized that endorsed the sentiment of the French uprising. As one example, the entire Park Theatre corps sang “La Marseillaise” in front of a backdrop of Paris before and in between the evening’s entertainments with the French flag prominently displayed on stage. New York residents from every economic class felt empowered by the July Revolution and wanted to embrace and celebrate the fortitude of the French people in the face of “tyranny and oppression.” The citizenry prepared a city-wide parade and celebration in honor of the Revolution. Throughout the fall, the French-themed works demonstrated an ideological affinity that New York residents felt for their Parisian compatriots.</p>
<p>When the New Orleans French Opera Company returned to New York for its fifth summer season in 1831, performers found a well-prepared, sympathetic welcome from New York audiences, for whom it produced new plays and vaudevilles based on the previous year’s events. The writer for the French-language newspaper <em>Courrier des États-Unis</em> pointed out that, because of their physical distance from the actual events, the new works remained intriguing to the French abroad. The transatlantic reception by the French paper, however, reveals a tense and combative reaction to the portrayal of the current political environment. The <em>Courrier</em>, a pro-bonapartist newspaper, disapproved of many of the works. Two works that portrayed Napoleon—who as a stage character had been banned from the Parisian stage—resulted in emotional responses from the French expatriates, some of whom had served under the general. In this paper, I illustrate how New Yorkers as a whole came to understand the circumstances in Paris through performances at the Park Theatre, examine the reception of the New Orleans French Opera Company’s politically infused works, and discuss the participation and influence of the French-speaking community within New York society.</p>
