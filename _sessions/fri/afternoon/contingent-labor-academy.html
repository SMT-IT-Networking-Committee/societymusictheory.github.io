<p>Contingent labor in the academic workforce is growing at a steady rate.
With no end in sight, the issues that affect contingent laborers—including
lack of job security, few to no benefits, and lack of supplies and office
space—continue to hinder those who work in those positions. One of the ways in
which these situations can be mitigated is with advocacy, either the
self-advocacy of contingent laborers or the advocacy of full-time faculty who
hire and supervise contingent laborers.</p>

<p>This panel features speakers from the United States and Canada who hire
contingent faculty, supervise contingent faculty, and who are contingent
faculty themselves. They will speak to the issue of contingent labor advocacy
and the ways in which contingent workers have negotiated their contract,
benefits, and workplace; possibilities for working within the larger
university institution to create better working conditions for all contingent
workers; the effects of a two-tiered structure in higher education; how to
bring about awareness in the classroom; and the challenges of hiring and
advocating for contingent faculty as a non-tenured, tenured, or other position
of power within higher education. The session will culminate in a roundtable
discussion that will be opened to the floor.</p>
