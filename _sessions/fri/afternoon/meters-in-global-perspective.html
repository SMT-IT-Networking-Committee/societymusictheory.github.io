<p class="abs-title">Timeline Spaces: A Theory of Temporal Process in African Drum/Dance Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Chris Stover (The New School)</p>

<p>The morphological details of timelines—as asymmetrical configurations of event onsets that repeat consistently through a musical performance—are well-documented. These studies, however, fall short of explaining exactly what role timelines play in more extended musical contexts. This paper focuses on the musical contexts of which timelines form an essential layer, steering away from “what” questions to “why” questions—why timelines exist and what function they serve. Part of the issue at stake is that timelines are invariably described in conceptual terms derived from meter and rhythm, which come up lacking for a thus-far undisclosed reason. Timelines are not well-explained using the conceptual scaffolding of meter and rhythm because timelines are <em>neither meter nor rhythm</em>, nor do they occupy a middle ground that takes on characteristics of both. Timelines define a unique musical-temporal space that has not yet been properly theorized. This paper is a move toward doing so, pointing to a new <em>timeline space</em> that interacts essentially with both meter and rhythm while being reducible to neither, and a <em>timeline music</em> that defines a class of music-making practices that include a timeline (articulated or not) as one of a number of syntactic strata. Three related concepts follow from this: the notion of <em>malleable</em> and <em>dehierarchized strata</em>, an account of <em>call and response</em> as structurally generative, and a consideration of the role the rhythm–meter–timeline assemblage plays in bestowing a truly <em>circular</em> temporal conception to musical process, which I argue is the key to why timelines exist.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Polymetric Phrasing in Rumba’s Quinto</p>
<p class="abs-author">Fernando Benadon (American University)</p>

<p>In Afro-Cuban rumba drumming, individual ostinatos are layered to produce a cyclical polyphonic texture. The quinto (lead conga drum) often features extensive improvisation, heightening the ensemble’s already complex counterpoint. Polymeter plays a central role in quinto phrasing. This paper examines quinto improvisation in recorded rumba performances in order to highlight polymetric possibilities left unaddressed in studies of timing, polyrhythm, and metrical dissonance. Examples of such polymetric instances include rhythmic dissonance by way of sub-metrical displacement magnitudes, complex polymeter via temporal distortion of simple note values, phrase morphing from beginning-accented to end-accented, and—in clave-based contexts—the perceptual weakening or strengthening of the rumba clave’s maximally even feel. The overarching argument is that it is insufficient to describe polymeter using ratios only, since knowing the precise arrangement of onsets provides essential information about the composite rhythm’s internal structure and the resulting musical effect.</p>


<p class="abs-title">What’s the Meter of <em>Elenino Horo</em>? Rhythm and Timing in Drumming for a Bulgarian Folk Dance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel Goldberg (Yale University)</p>

<p>The meters of numerous Bulgarian folk songs and dance pieces are understood to include beats with two categorically different durations, short and long, notated in a ratio of 2:3. Commonly performed dance types bear conventional time signatures that index particular sequences of beats, and many Bulgarian musicians know these time signatures. Yet in the case of one popular dance type, <em>elenino horo</em>, performers express considerable uncertainty and differences of opinion about the beat sequence and time signature.</p>
<p>This lack of consensus serves as the starting point for a study of meter in <em>elenino horo</em> as performed on the <em>tŭpan</em>, a large, double-sided drum that is considered the time-keeping instrument in many Bulgarian folk music ensembles. I define meter from a cognitive perspective, as a largely unconscious mental framework for organizing musical time, and I seek to access meter indirectly by analyzing measurements of performed rhythms in relation to ethnographic observations.</p>
<p>Despite their familiarity with notational terminology, many <em>tŭpan</em> players identify drumming for <em>elenino horo</em> and other dances by means of performances of “basic” (<em>osnovni</em>) rhythms that are repeated and varied. I propose that frequencies and timing of drum strokes in such rhythmic templates reflect fine-grained but important differences among the underlying temporal frameworks that individual players rely on, meaning that there is no single answer to the presentation’s titular question. Instead, individual musicians perform <em>elenino horo</em> with different meters, the characteristics of which potentially have broad implications for cognitive theories of meter.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Conceptualizing Meter in Early Indojazz</p>
<p class="abs-author">Peter Selinsky (Yale University)</p>

<p>Joe Harriott and John Mayer’s double quintet “Indo-Jazz Fusions” (1966–68) was the first extended collaboration to fuse modern jazz and Indian classical practices into a new genre. The emerging music, Indojazz, attempted to improvise itself into existence: Mayer’s Indian classical quintet and Harriott’s jazz ensemble came together to contribute on behalf of their individual cultures. And, in real time, the musicians reciprocally conformed their contributions to Indojazz’s sound as it developed. This music-cultural reciprocity meant that no individual (musician, composer, producer, etc.) could be the primary agent of the music’s creation. As such, Indojazz stands apart from many hybrid musical genres and begs many basic questions of the mechanisms of its production: How did these musicians reconcile their differing approaches with one another? What features of the composed works facilitated cohesiveness in their improvised performances?</p>
<p>As a starting point for answering these questions, I explore rhythmic organization, a central challenge for early Indojazz performances. Through a comparative discussion of modern jazz rhythm, Hindustani tāl theory, and tabla pedagogy, I posit a preliminary framework for a theory of Indojazz meter. In a close analysis of “Overture,” from <em>Indo-Jazz Suite</em> (1966), I investigate how individual musicians from various Indian classical and jazz traditions navigate this framework.</p>
