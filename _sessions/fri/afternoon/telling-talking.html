<p class="abs-title">Improvisation, Interaction, and Interpretation: Relational
  Dynamics in Duke Ellington’s <i>Money Jungle</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Garrett Michaelsen (University of Massachusetts, Lowell)</p>

<p>In this paper, I present an extension of my theory of musical interaction in jazz improvisation that incorporates an understanding of “relational dynamics.” Central to my original theory are processes of convergence and divergence, which are the principal means by which I understand musicians’ utterances as coming together or growing apart. By adding a continuum of positive and negative relational valence to this spectrum of convergence and divergence, I enable a constellation of new interpretive meanings. I will then present an interpretation of the musical interaction found in Duke Ellington’s “Money Jungle” that takes into account the unique circumstances surrounding the recording of his 1962 album of the same name. Two much younger musicians, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, joined Ellington on this date, and constantly pushed and pulled against the older jazz statesman. Due to their complicated interpersonal history, Mingus in particular presented numerous challenges to Ellington that resulted in him walking out of the recording session. Ellington eventually coaxed Mingus back in to finish, a fact that provides an apt metaphor for the musical interaction found in their performance of “Money Jungle.” While Mingus tends towards divergence throughout the performance, Ellington and Roach do their best to support and incorporate Mingus’s utterances into the ongoing flow of the improvisation.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Talking Back: Analyzing Performer-Audience Interaction in
  Roscoe Mitchell’s <i>Nonaah</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Paul Steinbeck (Washington University in St. Louis)</p>

<p>August 23, 1976: Roscoe Mitchell took the stage at the Jazz Festival Willisau as a last-minute replacement for Anthony Braxton. Some audience members applauded when Mitchell appeared on stage, but the Braxton fans greeted him with catcalls and jeers. To Mitchell, this inauspicious welcome felt like a confrontation, and he resolved to gain control of the situation by performing his solo saxophone composition “Nonaah.”</p>
<p>Instead of playing the entire theme, Mitchell decided to repeat just the opening phrase. After a few repetitions, the festivalgoers started to react. Mitchell’s supporters shouted their approval, while his detractors interpreted the insistent repeating phrase as a provocation. In fact, Mitchell was engaged in a musical experiment. From one repetition to the next, he held certain elements constant and radically varied others, pushing the phrase to its parametric limits and calibrating his variations to produce verbal, vocal, and bodily responses from the crowd. Mitchell stayed with this experiment for nearly one hundred phrase repetitions, until the last skeptics finally yielded.</p>
<p>A close analysis of the Willisau recording demonstrates how Mitchell’s performance of “Nonaah” emerged from his real-time interactions with the audience. As the performance unfolds, Mitchell’s dynamic contrasts, bent pitches, and complex timbres elicit audible responses from the crowd. Many of these sonic devices are associated with free jazz, but recent empirical research shows that these sounds can cause intense listener responses in any musical context. Mitchell’s performance corroborates these empirical findings—and suggests that certain stylistic markers of free jazz have a psychological basis.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Telling Jazz’s Story: Duke Ellington <i>Ko-Ko</i> and Congo
  Square</p>
<p class="abs-author">Darren LaCour (Washington University in St. Louis)</p>

<p>Music critics and theorists have long praised the 1940 Victor recording of Duke Ellington’s “Ko-Ko” for its motivic continuity and modernist harmonies, an example of Ellington’s best “pure music.” In his spoken introduction to the piece at his band’s 1943 Carnegie Hall debut, however, Ellington characterized it as a “descriptive scene of the days that inspired jazz…at a place called Congo Square.” The band takes a tempo roughly twenty percent faster than the original, and substitutes a clarinet solo for Ellington’s piano solo from 1940. In fact, most extant recordings of “Ko-Ko” after the March 1940 studio session and as early as June of 1940 feature these two changes.</p>
<p>This paper uses Ellington’s remarks to create a historically grounded hermeneutic analysis of the 1943 Carnegie Hall performance. Around this time, Congo Square began to take hold as a mythic origin story for jazz, due in part to Frederic Ramsey, Jr. and Charles Edward Smith’s 1939 book <i>Jazzmen</i>, which lifted accounts of Congo Square from nineteenth-century travelogues. Musicologist Samuel Floyd, Jr.’s conceptual-cultural framework of the ring shout is based on one such account, providing precedent for my analytic approach. Ellington’s spoken introduction at Carnegie Hall inserted “Ko-Ko” into the emerging narrative of jazz history. When the orchestra revisited the piece in 1956, the musical signifiers continued to convey that history. The 1940 “Ko-Ko” has become canonic in jazz history for its modern, progressive musical features, but as the later versions show, Ellington positioned it as a link to the past.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Lies, Betrayals, & Fruit-Covered Nails: Tight and Loose Rhyme
  Schemes in Indie Rock</p>
<p class="abs-author">David Heetderks (Oberlin College Conservatory)</p>

<p>The dichotomy between tight- and loose-knit formal regions has proved relevant for pop and rock: scholars have shown how songs display this dichotomy in their degree of melodic–harmonic “divorce” or in their amount of metric or hypermetric dissonance. This presentation defines a spectrum of tightness and looseness for rock lyrics. Tight lyrics are created by regular line-length and consistent end-rhyme. They can be loosened by various degrees through less consistent line-length or rhyme, or through rejection of rhyme in favor of alliteration or assonance.</p>
<p>As a case study, the presentation examines the expressive and formal functions of lyrical tightness in songs by The Smiths and Pavement, two indie bands from the 1980s and 1990s who are known for clever lyrics and unique vocal delivery. In music by these bands, modulating from tight to loose lyrics can reinforce a change from regular to ambiguous hypermeter, or reinforce a transition between types of vocal phrases. Deviation from a tight lyric often highlights themes in the text. Finally, some songs reverse the loose-verse/tight-chorus formal model, placing the loosest lyrics in the chorus in order to depict ambivalence or aimlessness, instead of the triumph or collective unity often depicted in this section.</p>
<p>The model of tightness provides a new way of discussing expressive and formal deformation in rock, and it illuminates a means by which indie bands differentiate themselves from other rock genres.</p>
