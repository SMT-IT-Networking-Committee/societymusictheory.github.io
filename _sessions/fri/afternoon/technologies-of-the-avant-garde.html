<p class="abs-title">Of Doubles, Groups, and Rhymes: Spatialized Works and the Artistic Response to Sound Technology</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jonathan Goldman (University of Montreal)</p>

<p>Between March 1958 and October 1960, no less than five major works for spatially distributed orchestral groups (with or without electronic sounds) received their first performances in Europe: Pierre Boulez’s <em>Doubles</em> (which would later be expanded into <em>Figures, doubles, prismes</em>), Karlheinz Stockhausen’s <em>Gruppen</em> and <em>Carré</em>, Luciano Berio’s <em>Allelujah II</em>, Henri Pousseur’s <em>Rimes pour multiples sources sonores</em> were all premiered during that two-year period, sometimes days apart. One of the important developments of this era concerns music recording and sound reproduction, specifically the commercial introduction of stereo long-playing records that led to the mass distribution of stereo sound technology into homes throughout the world, including the introduction of stereo long-playing records in 1958; stereo radio transmission also started to come of age over the course of the decade beginning in that year, and multi-channel cinema-sound systems were already commonplace in major urban centers around the world. To what extent were listeners’ experiences of the aforementioned spatialized works informed by their new familiarity with stereo sound? To what extent did composers respond to listeners’ expectations about, and understanding of, stereo in their spatialized works? The answers to these seemingly naive questions require evaluating the extent to which an allusion to the technology of stereophony may have been inscribed into these works, an inscription that might include both ways audiences were inclined to hear stereophonic effects in these works and composers might have reacted in their works to these expectations. This talk draws on Mark Katz’s research on “phonograph effects” and a historiographic framework for the history of sound recording developed by Jochen Stolla. Comparing these composers’ discourse on their works reveals the ways they aim to strategically position themselves with respect to technological innovations of their time, while confronting listeners’ reactions to these works (in the form of the ample published concert reviews) reveals the extent to which the new modes of technologically assisted domestic listening informed listeners’ experiences of these works, even when, as is the case for most of these works, they do not employ electronic means as such.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Coding of Community: Carla Scaletti, Kyma, and Community Formation in Computer Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Madison Heying (University of California, Santa Cruz)</p>

<p>In 1989, composer and computer scientist Carla Scaletti (b. 1956) published an article in <em>Computer Music Journal</em> in which she stated that a successful computer music language must “serve a community of users.” Scaletti made this statement two years before Kyma—the programming language she developed—became available to the public. Kyma is an object-oriented sound design environment for the implementation of compositional algorithms and the creation of complex musical systems. Along with Scaletti’s desire to engineer a programming environment conducive to composing, forming, and fostering a community of users was a primary consideration from an early stage in Kyma’s development. Kyma was also influenced by Scaletti’s participation with the CERL Sound Group at the University of Illinois; it shaped her inclusive and practical approach to technology and is manifest in the design of Kyma.</p>
<p>The Kyma community is emblematic of a shift that occurred in the late 1980s and ’90s: the advent and accessibility of personal computers and the internet allowed experimental music-making communities to evolve outside of the studio, lab, and university. Kyma has now been in use for over two decades; there is a small yet thriving international community of users that includes composers, sound designers, and researchers. They connect through email, online forums that are built into Kyma, and annual meetings.</p>
<p>In this paper I analyze Scaletti’s work with the CERL Sound Group, her music, Kyma, and the Kyma community to understand and document the forces at work in forming the Kyma community, and how Scaletti’s deliberate community cultivation has made itself manifest in the nature of the community and its musical output. I will rely on my own ethnography conducted at two Kyma International Sound Symposiums, interviews with Scaletti and Kyma users, Scaletti’s published materials including the Kyma manual, and literature on community formation by musicologist Thomas Turino and anthropologist Victor Turner. Kyma is a critical and unique example of how digital and communication technology in the 1980s transformed not only how computer music was made, but how music-making communities form and operate.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Avant-Garde Goes Corporate: Soundtracks and Sound Experiments at the Siemens Studio for Electronic Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nicholas Jurkowski (University of California, Santa Barbara)</p>
<p>The years following the end of World War II saw the founding of many celebrated electronic music studios, including the Groupe de Recherches Musicales, the Westdeutscher Rundfunk’s Studio for Electronic Music, and the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. The Siemens Corporation’s Studio for Electronic Music, established in 1957, followed in this vein, but as the product of private enterprise, represents a unique moment in time where an international corporation believed that avant-garde electronic composition could serve their commercial interests. Siemens equipped the studios with state of the art multimedia technology—the facilities garnered praise from Pierre Boulez, who later credited the studio’s technical innovations with inspiring some of the technologies at IRCAM. The corporate profit motive at the studio’s core meant that it was essentially removed from the aesthetic and philosophical debates that defined the founding of other electronic music studios (the GRM and the WDR Cologne Studios in particular), which created a unique compositional environment.</p>
<p>This paper explores the establishment, operation, dissolution, and legacy of Siemens’s Electronic Music Studio, from its creation specifically for the composition of music for Siemens’s groundbreaking promotional film, <em>Impuls unserer Zeit</em> (scored by Anton Riedl), to its demise after becoming a chip in an internal power struggle following its donation to the Ulm School of Design. Because of its uniquely non-partisan position, it became a haven for composers who sought to remove themselves from the tendentious polemic that often characterized interaction between members of rival schools, like Mauricio Kagel, who composed <em>Antithese</em> (for actor and electronics), at the studio in 1961. The Siemens Studio’s corporate nature meant that it was subject to market forces that first allowed it to thrive, then ultimately doomed it. Its story serves as a fascinating case study in the de facto private sponsorship and monetization of avant-garde composition, and the boons and perils such sponsorship brings.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Pre-history of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rachel S. Vandagriff (Oakland, Calif.)</p>
<p>The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center was the first formal institution of its kind in the United States. Prior to enabling its formal establishment in 1958, the Rockefeller Foundation awarded Vladimir Ussachefsky and Otto Luening a grant in 1952 “to purchase basic equipment to be used exclusively for creative research in the field of electronic music.” The Center arguably represents the birthplace of electronic music experiment in the U.S., as well as the birthplace of the notion of composition as research, which underpins the patronage of composers in higher education.</p>
<p>Though the Center is well known, the history of its funding and institutionalization have yet to be told in any depth. Based on archival material from the Rockefeller Archive Center and Columbia University, this paper will investigate the social, technological, and economic prehistory of the Center. It will focus in particular on the marriage of university and private missions and monies that enabled the Center’s existence, so as to reveal why certain musics and technologies were promoted over others.</p>
<p>Luening and Ussachefsky saw their tape compositions as distinct from <em>musique concrète</em> and <em>elektronische Musik</em>, describing their work as decidedly more aesthetic than either European camp, and also more worthy of interest and funding than experiments in the popular music industry. As they explained it to the Rockefeller Foundation officers, <em>musique concrète</em> was an effort “to make tape recordings of different kinds of sounds in the natural world . . . without regard to their musical significance.” By contrast, Luening and Ussachefsky’s work emphasized “the musical and humanistic elements” of electronic music composition. The tape recorder was a tool of the “imagination,” rather than laboratory equipment, and tape music was a “means of removing certain barriers that block the course of western music, and of bringing to a synthesis the new materials of the twentieth century and the musical values of the past.” Simultaneously, Milton Babbitt was experimenting with computer-synthesized sound, preferring that technology to the splicing of tape. This paper will seek to expose how these competing interests were made manifest in the Center and how they influenced the future Center’s mission.</p>
