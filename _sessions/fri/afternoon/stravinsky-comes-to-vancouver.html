<h1>Stravinsky Comes to Vancouver</h1>

<p class="chair">H. Colin Slim (University of California, Irvine)</p>

<p>Stravinsky was no stranger to the Pacific Northwest: witness his engagements at Tacoma and Seattle in March, 1937. Yet, fifteen years elapsed before he conducted in Vancouver. Canada’s two largest cities, Montreal and Toronto, heard him concertize in 1937, and Montreal heard him again in 1945.</p>
<p>His first engagement with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra resulted indirectly from an invitation to attend an all-Stravinsky concert sponsored by the University of British Columbia in April 1952, which he could not accept. A month later, the Symphony Society authorized its representative to negotiate with him directly. Stravinsky responded with enthusiasm about visiting this “beautiful western province.” Arriving 1 October with daughter and son-in-law, they settled in the Hotel Vancouver.</p>
<p>Previous VSO guest conductors—Barbirolli, Beecham, Bernstein, Goosens, and Klemperer—had not appreciably lessened Vancouver’s provincialism, to judge from the City Council’s rancorous debate of Mayor Hume’s proposal to honor Stravinsky with Vancouver’s ceremonial golden key. But the composer triumphed, even dictating his own date and time for this ceremony.</p>
<p>His only other appearances, on 12 and 13 July 1965 (sharing both concerts with Craft), were booked through Sol Hurok’s local agent for Vancouver’s Eighth International Festival. Domiciled with wife Vera at the Bayshore Inn, the increasingly infirm 83-year-old also traveled with Hurok’s agent and Lawrence Morton, a long-time Los Angeles admirer. Morton’s omnipresence led Hurok’s local representative years later to publicly impugn Stravinsky’s sexual preferences.</p>
<p>The city’s untapped cache of photographs and archives allow reconstruction through sight and sound of Stravinsky’s impact on its musical life, which extends into our new century. His orchestra rehearsals provoked on-the-spot corrections, several still identifiable within his scores. Recollections about his conducting style included pithy remarks from orchestra members and from an emigré ethnomusicologist. Moreover, his interaction with two UBC faculty members elicited a rare confession of uncertainty.</p>
<p>UBC’s growing Stravinsky collection (currently some 137 items) betokens a major North American scholarly resource. This accomplishment is briefly evaluated vis-à-vis public collections and the few known private ones on our continent. A display will feature items from UBC’s collection.</p>
