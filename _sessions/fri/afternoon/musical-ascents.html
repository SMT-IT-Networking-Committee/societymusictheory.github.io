<p class="abs-title">Stepwise Modulation as a Dramatic Device for Tonic Return in
  Musical Theater Songs</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nathan Beary Blustein (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Stepwise modulation is one of the best-known ways in musical theater to heighten the intensity of a song or number. It is almost always associated with tonal departure: once a song modulates up by step, that song is not expected to return to the original key, even if the modulation is musically and dramatically sophisticated (Buchler 2008, Hoffman 2014). Occasionally, though, stepwise modulation comes at the end of a series of key changes, and the final upward shift by whole or half step brings the song back to the key in which it began—that is, stepwise modulation acts as a return. Aligning this intensifying modulation with tonic return greatly augments its rhetorical potential.</p>
<p>But how <i>recognizable</i> is this alignment, and what benefits can a listener or audience member gain from recognizing it? To answer these questions, this paper will present analyses of three songs from contemporary musicals that achieve a tonic return via stepwise modulation. The first is “What a Game,” from <i>Ragtime</i> (1998, Steven Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens); the second is The Wizard and I,” from <i>Wicked</i> (first staged in 2003, written by Steven Schwartz); and the last is “So Much Better,” from <i>Legally Blonde</i> (2007, Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin). All three of these songs use an alignment of stepwise modulation and tonic return to support dramatic development, indicating that this unusual alignment is an especially significant gesture.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“As Astonishing as They are Inevitable”: Complex Harmonic
  Sequences Preceding Reprises in the Late Music of Gabriel Fauré </p>
<p class="abs-author">Adam Ricci (University of North Carolina at Greensboro)</p>

<p>In a 2012 Colloquy in <I>JAMS</I>, Steven Rings characterizes Fauré’s harmony as having “Escher-like kinetics…in which we at once traverse considerable harmonic ground and do not move at all.” One of the ways Fauré achieves such a paradoxical effect is via harmonic sequences that are constructed from long and multi-level patterns and that feature intricate alterations. Unlike the (relatively) tidy sequences of our pedagogies, the long patterns of such sequences serve as thematic building blocks; and as Richard Bass has demonstrated, rich alterations to a sequence can assume motivic significance.</p>
<p>Fauré’s complex sequences are often located just prior to formal reprises. Echoing Rings’ “Escher-like kinetics” (albeit 14 years earlier), Ken Johansen characterizes Fauré’s tonal returns as accomplished “by means that seem as inevitable as they are astonishing.” In this paper, I examine three sequences, describing the varied ways in which each one prepares and colors a tonal and/or thematic reprise. In the Barcarolle No. 4 (1886), I demonstrate how a Slide-Parallel cycle plays at the boundaries between the endpoints of its patterns, employing augmented triads as liminal “way stations.” In the Nocturne No. 10 (1908), I depict the path of a motive that is gradually constricted by chromatic and enharmonic elements, elements that are suddenly released at the return of the opening material. And in the Violin Sonata No. 2 (1916–17), I schematicize a chain of sequences that appears in two formal rotations and contrast its first and second appearances in terms of their separation or joining together of tonal and thematic return.</p>

<p class="abs-title">When You Wish Upon A Star Your Melody Ascends: Aspirational
  Disney Songs and the Ascending <i>Urlinie</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael Buchler (Florida State University)</p>

<p>“When You Wish Upon A Star,” “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,” and “You Can Fly! You Can Fly! You Can Fly!” all end high, ascending to their respective final tonics, and all explore the upper tetrachord (scale degrees 5-6-7-8) to a far greater degree than the lower pentachord (scale degrees 1-2-3-4-5). Upper-tetrachord songs such as these often depict escalating intensity, anxiety, and joy and they sometimes even marry the conceptual metaphor of pitch height to other metaphors involving height. These songs also run afoul of the well-known core principle (especially attributable to Schenker) that structural closure is brought about by a stepwise descent to tonic at or near the end of a work. This talk explores both structural and affective trends in upper-tetrachord songs from the mid-century Disney songbook.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Barber’s Adagio as Mourning Cycle</p>
<p class="abs-author">David Huron (The Ohio State University)</p>

<p>In a BBC World Service survey, Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” was voted the “World’s saddest music.” What precisely are the musical features that lead listeners to consider Barber’s Adagio “sad?” The use of the work in films and state funerals suggests simple learned cultural associations. However, careful analysis suggests that Barber made use of classic expressive patterns that parallel psychological research on mourning.</p>
<p>Psychologists of grief have identified a so-called “mourning cycle” (Marsella, et al., 1985). In response to the death of a loved one, for example, it is common to observe alternations between periods of active grieving (crying) and periods of passive sadness (despondency). Research by the World Health Organization (1983) suggests that this back-and-forth cycle is evident world-wide and is not limited to any given culture.</p>
<p>In this paper, it is argued that, unlike other nominally sad works, Barber’s Adagio exhibits a “mourning cycle” structure in which both active (crying) and passive (despondency) patterns are evident. For example, the work begins with a classic low-slow-quiet-monotone-dark texture symptomatic of acoustic sadness, but at the peak of the work exhibits the high-loud-intense-breaking texture symptomatic of acoustic grief.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the distinction between grief (crying) and sadness (despondency) provides a useful framework for analyzing two different forms of nominally sad musical expression, and that alternations between the two forms in certain works (like Barber’s Adagio) effectively models the mourning cycle. Additional illustrations are offered from ethnomusicological and popular music sources.</p>
