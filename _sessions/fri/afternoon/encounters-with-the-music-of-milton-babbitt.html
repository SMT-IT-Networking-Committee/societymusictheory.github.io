<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>This special session seeks to commemorate Babbitt’s centennial by celebrating the experience of listening to his music. To demonstrate the value of an ears-first approach, the session will begin with panelists presenting close hearings of selected passages of Babbitt’s music.</p>
<p>The session brings together seven Babbitt scholars, both emerging and established. A wide range of pieces will be discussed: <em>Semi-Simple Variations</em>, <em>Occasional Variations</em>, <em>A Solo Requiem</em>, <em>Whirled Series</em>, Clarinet Quintet<em>, Swan Song no. 1</em>, and several string quartets. The papers will focus on numerous topics too rarely discussed in Babbitt scholarship, including performance, pedagogy, expression, rhetoric, and his music’s sense of playfulness.</p>
<p>The session will end with a round-table discussion involving the panelists and audience. The discussion will focus on four issues: What does aural experience teach us about Babbitt’s music that might not be gained from score study? Conversely, what does investigation of serial structure teach us that might guide aural experience? How has our hearing changed over the course of long-term analytical engagement? What do we, as teachers, feel is the best way to introduce this music to new listeners?</p>
<p>In sum, by presenting a range of new work on under-discussed pieces and passages and by focusing on aspects of the music that initially drew us toward Babbitt’s work, we will at once commemorate Babbitt’s achievement and set the stage for continued engagement with it.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“And we go . . . even we [, even so]”: Memory and Closure at the End of Babbitt’s <em>A Solo Requiem</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Zachary Bernstein (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>The concluding passage of <em>A Solo Requiem</em> provides a nearly unique view into Babbitt’s conception of text and text-music relations. It is one of few places in which Babbitt essentially creates his own text—here, by repeating key lines from the previous settings in the cycle. A close reading of this passage reveals not only a search for a “tenable attitude toward death,” as Joseph Dubiel has it, but a passage suffused with memory—memory of the fallen and of the cycle preceding—and an attempt at closure—of the cycle and of the long period of mourning the cycle represents.</p>
<p>This paper will discuss the expressive implications of the poetic lines chosen and their musical setting. The selected lines, some of which deviate from their original sources, reveal a tone of personal lament and loss. The pianos double most of the voice’s pitch classes, providing resonance and support for the voice’s peroration, but also present a dynamic profile starkly at odds with the voice: the voice, meditating on personal loss, floats above the pianos’ representation of chaos. Links between this concluding passage and earlier moments in the cycle contribute to closing and contribute to its expressive effects via semiotic association. In short, a close investigation of the end of <em>A Solo Requiem</em> reveals much about Babbitt’s expressive techniques. For Babbitt’s centennial, it is fitting to celebrate one of his most moving passages.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Simple Ways of Hearing, Playing, and Teaching Babbitt’s <em>Semi-Simple Variations</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Daphne Leong (University of Colorado, Boulder)</p>

<p>The structure of Milton Babbitt’s <em>Semi-Simple Variations</em> is well understood, having been amply explored in the analytic literature. In this presentation I describe and demonstrate some simple ways to hear, play, and teach the piece. Drawing from aural and structural features, I suggest how these might interact with and inform ways of shaping a performance. I also outline a plan for taking students into the piece ears first, to preempt a disconnect between aural experience and theoretic structure. The plan demonstrates specific ways to help students to discover structural features experientially and to grasp cross-references between structure and surface. The emphasis throughout is on transforming heard and embodied experience into conceptual and structural understanding and vice versa, and on the interactions of these interwoven ways of knowing. A performance of the one-minute piece will close the presentation.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Babbitt’s Beguiling Surfaces, Improvising Inside</p>
<p class="abs-author">Joshua Mailman (University of Alabama)</p>

<p>At certain times when listening to Babbitt’s music I have noticed how charmingly oddball it can sound. Nothing about the generic specifications of Babbitt’s compositional approach forecasts this quirkiness that we sometimes hear in his compositional surfaces. I take this to be a mark of his unique creative genius, a mark that gets swamped by the usual historical narrative that labels Babbitt as the innovator of 12-tone integral serialism.</p>
<p>Remarkably the quirky oddball passages stand out yet weave into a coherent fabric that one discovers only gradually. I will focus on three examples: (1) <em>herky jerky dynamics</em> in Quartets no. 1 and no. 2; (2) <em>eccentric textures</em> in <em>Semi-simple Variations</em>; and (3) <em>incongruous triads</em> in <em>Whirled Series</em>. For these examples I offer verbal characterizations of the quirky impression and explain how it ultimately weaves into a coherent fabric. Moreover I will suggest that these impressions of quirkiness are not accidental or incidental to Babbitt’s compositional “system” or approach; nor are they assured by it.</p>
<p>Rather than couching Babbitt’s compositional aesthetic in terms of extreme advance planning, the quirky facets of his music are perhaps better appreciated when couched in terms of some concept of <em>improvisation,</em> where “improvisation” means exploiting opportunities that arise in a new situation. Engaging writings of George Lewis, Gilbert Ryle, Andrew Mead, and Joseph Dubiel, I explain how Babbitt’s systematizing acts as a self-imposed challenge in his own improvisatory act: in confecting his quirky surfaces, Babbitt is pitting his acquired competence against fresh opportunities which his systematizing also created.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Between Innocence and Experience: How Analysis Might or Might Not Have Affected My Hearing of Milton Babbitt’s Music</p>

<p>My first encounters with the music of Milton Babbitt were live performances of the second String Quartet and <em>Philomel</em>. I had been warned that this was music to avoid—music that was solely and soullessly mathematical, cerebral, emotionally expressionless. That was not my impression at all on hearing it; the second quartet seemed delightfully playful, and <em>Philomel</em> was hair-raising in its intensity. Over the years I have never lost that sense of emotional impact despite the attention I have brought to the underlying theory of the music. Since I have perhaps foolishly thought the expressive impact of Babbitt’s music to be self-evident, I have spent little time trying to articulate that aspect of my experience, but it is worth questioning the nature of the connection between what attracts me emotionally to his music and its underlying structure.</p>
<p>Playfulness is a pervasive quality I find myself responding to in Babbitt’s music, and a good place to begin a consideration of this connection. Playfulness in music can emerge from the imaginative exploitation of opportunities arising from a willingly adopted rule set. In order for such brilliance to be perceived, certain aspects of such a rule set must be inferable by a listener. How that happens with Babbitt’s music involves teasing apart the ways the music’s seeming spontaneity can nudge the listener towards a sense of those underlying regularities that throw its playfulness into relief.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Listening to Babbitt’s <em>Occasional Variations</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Robert Morris (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>Milton Babbitt is often cited as a “pioneer” in the field of electronic music. Yes, despite essential structural connections between Babbitt’s electronic and acoustic pieces, there a very few discussions or analyses of the electronic works within the vast analytical Babbitt literature; two notable exceptions are Peel and Cramer (1988) and Morris (1997). This discrepancy is undoubtedly due to the lack of scores or transcriptions of Babbitt’s electronic works, and the typology of electronic sounds, which are often heard as more or less undifferentiated to those not familiar with the technical side of electronic music production.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Babbitt’s electronic works are deeply satisfying compositions and radical in some less acknowledged ways. In this paper, I will study some aural and hearable features of one of Babbitt’s lesser-known electronic compositions, <em>Occasional Variations</em>. The work is based on an all-partition array that is realized three times in the work with (indeed) occasional variations in its articulation in sound and time. All-partition arrays have singular features whose presence can be rendered as perceptually salient, and I will point these out by playing and comparing short segments of the work that aurally associate the same portions of the array realized in different ways, and different portions of the array realized in the same way. In this way, one can “hear” the presence of the array, if not in all of its details, then in the way it undergirds this work’s unique form and individual characteristics.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Octave Doubling in Babbitt’s <em>Swan Song no. 1</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Joseph N. Straus (Graduate Center, CUNY)</p>

<p>Octave equivalence (as a theoretical concept) and octave doubling (as a compositional practice) have sometimes been seen as problems in twelve-tone theory and twelve-tone music. In twelve-tone theory, octave equivalence has usually been so deeply assumed as to seem to require little effort at justification. Octave doubling as a compositional practice, however, has been more controversial, including among twelve-tone composers. In Babbitt’s music, the contrapuntal lines rarely coincide in a shared, simultaneously articulated pitch class.</p>
<p>Against that general stylistic backdrop, the prevalence of octave doubling in Babbitt’s <em>Swan Song no. 1</em> comes as something of an aural shock. The piece is a sextet (flute, oboe, mandolin, guitar, violin, and cello) with each instrument projecting its own four-line trichordal array. The form of the piece is defined by the various instrumental combinations (solos, duets, trios, quartets, quintets), and the beginnings of new formal sections are often marked by prominent octaves between the instrumental parts.</p>
<p>The final section of the piece is played by the full ensemble, with each of the instruments providing a complete aggregate of all twelve tones, arranged into four contrapuntal lines. With six aggregates (and twenty-four contrapuntal lines) unfolding simultaneously, there is ample opportunity for octave doubling between the parts, and Babbitt seizes that opportunity with astonishing frequency. Earlier in the piece, Babbitt used octaves to help articulate formal divisions. Here, at the end, he uses them to create an effect of dying away or fading out, a sort of dying fall into the most perfect of traditional consonances.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Babbitt via Feldman: Surfaces of Echoes and Reflection</p>
<p class="abs-author">Anton Vishio (William Paterson University)</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of the Clarinet Quintets by Milton Babbitt and Morton Feldman on a recent recording by the Phoenix Ensemble might seem curious, given the distances between their compositional worlds; but the works nevertheless keep surprisingly good company. Listening to them in tandem reveals shared concerns for process and rhetoric, even as it reinforces the vastly different forms in which those concerns are realized. I shall explore in particular how attending to features of Feldman’s work suggest strategies for hearing Babbitt’s. For all that the Feldman is concerned with explicit patterning of a kind that held no attraction for his senior colleague, the effects of echo and refraction created by the layering and eventual undermining of those patterns are particularly rich in musical affect. Meanwhile, Babbitt’s surface volatility is often set against “anchors,” elements of temporary stability that reverberate throughout a passage, whose backdrop permits the play of a variety of distorted imitations. In both compositions, the resulting surfaces resemble a succession of complex knots that continuously twist and unravel, through varied episodes of convergence and dispersal. “If it looks like an object, throw it out”; Feldman’s aphorism seems apt for Babbitt’s music as well.</p>
