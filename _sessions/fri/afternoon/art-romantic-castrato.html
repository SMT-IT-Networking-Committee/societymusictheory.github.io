<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Giovanni Battista Velluti was born in 1780, had his operatic debut in 1798,
and enjoyed a high-profile operatic career, taking his final bow in Florence’s
<i>Teatro</i> <i>La Pergola </i>in Meyerbeer’s <i>Il crociato in Egitto </i>in
1833, singing a role written expressly for him. Velluti was famous as an
ornamenter. His “graces” were praised and imitated not only by the most
prominent prima donnas of the day, but, thanks to his assiduous publication of
dozens of ornamented songs, arias, duets and trios, by amateur singers all
over Europe. Mary Shelley, writing as “Anglo-Italicus” in 1826, publicly
proclaimed Velluti to be not only a brilliant ornamenter and passionate actor,
but also the artistic model for soprano Giuditta Pasta (<i>the</i> interpreter
of the operas of Bellini during the composer’s lifetime).</p>

<p>Throughout the second half of his career it was his ornamentation, as much
as his voice or his performing skills, that was the focus of critical
attention. In 1817, Meyerbeer found his eight variations on “Nel cor più non
mi sento” from Paisiello’s <i>La Molinara </i>to be<i> </i>“artistic and
original,” and preferred them to Angelica Catalani’s on the same theme. During
the final decade of his career, Velluti began to publish his ornaments, at
first in Italy but primarily in England. These at times were introduced with
the superscript “For those amateurs desirous of acquiring Senior Velluti’s
celebrated style of ornamentation.”</p>

<p>More than twenty-five of the solo songs, arias, scenes and cantatas survive
(in addition to nearly as many duos and trios), mostly in published form,
though also in several manuscripts. While much of this music comes from
operas, it can no longer truly be considered to be operatic. Velluti’s later,
private performing career in the homes of the rich and powerful was as
important, if not more so, than was his public one, and this music is—with two
exceptions, one for harp and one for guitar—all for voice and pianoforte. It
was clearly, intentionally removed from the operatic sphere and placed into
one of domestic music making, both to sung by the famous castrato in the
glittering musical “fêtes” of the aristocracy (where he was very well paid)
and by private singers in settings ranging from voice lessons, to parties, to
the intimate family circle. This repertoire was used pedagogically—this
version of “T’abbracio, ti stringo” comes from a manuscript from the personal
collection of Henrietta Sala, one of Velluti’s star pupils during his London
period. She was a prominent private singer as well as stage performer.</p>

<p>About 1822, Velluti developed a friendship with John Fane, Lord Burghersh,
amateur composer and founder of the Royal Academy of Music. Among Velluti’s
publications are several of Burghersh’s songs and arias, including
the—<i>with</i> Velluti’s alterations—wonderful “L’amor timido,” on a text by
Metastasio. (Beethoven also set this text, and Metastasio was still widely
appreciated, especially, by the English Romantics.) Burghersh had such great
respect for the singer that he allowed Velluti the liberty of drastically
altering his pleasant but forgettable arias into subtle little gems of
Romanticism. It is with Burghersh’s music that Velluti’s art arguably reached
its zenith.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best proof of the regard in which Velluti’s creativity was held
comes from a perusal of three versions of the famous <i>scena</i> <i>ed aria
</i>“Notte Tremenda” from Francesco Morlacchi’s <i>Tebaldo e Isolina</i>. By
combining the original 1822 composing manuscript and Velluti’s 1822–24
ornamentation, published with pianoforte accompaniment in Italy in 1822 and in
London in 1825, one finds extensive replication of Velluti’s ornaments in
Morlacchi’s final, 1825 version, prepared and performed in Dresden without the
castrato. Comparing the 1822 original to Velluti’s 1822–25 changes, the
<i>Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review</i>,<i> </i>in early 1826, deplored
the practice of such extravagant ornamentation, but wrote that, nevertheless,
the aria would have been nothing without it. Importantly, the magazine also
noted that Velluti, in performance, adhered fairly closely to his published
ornaments.</p>

<p>In 1838, though in retirement,  Velluti sang for Adolphe Nourrit, famed
tenor of the old, falsetto school of singing. Nourrit had been chased out of
Paris by his colleague Gilbert Duprez’s “chest voice high C” (Pleasants 1995).
Nourrit praised the castrato for being the founder of the modern school of the
prima donna: “[Rosamunda] Pisaroni, Pasta and . . . [Fanny Persiani]
Tacchinardi. He is certainly the master [teacher] of all the great female
singers of this era; it is a tree that has produced all those beautiful
fruits” (Quicherat 1867). These singers created title roles that are landmarks
of Italian romantic opera: <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>,<i> Anna Bolena</i>,
<i>La Sonnambula</i>, and <i>Norma</i>.  </p>

<p>Velluti was, in the best of times, seen as a kind of otherworldly being,
ethereal, eternally childlike, yet whose childhood trauma, always audible in
his adult soprano voice—at least in the fervid imaginings of the literary
Romantics—enabled him to extend a kind of universality, a shared pain that
brought all of his audience with him. Regarding his Munich performances of the
<i>scena ed aria</i> “Ecco o numi: Ah quando cesserà” from Nicolini’s <i>Carlo
Magno</i> the <i>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung für 1819 </i>wrote:  “The
singer, with his tones of woe and joy, is the representation of pure humanity
in its inner pain, the deep sorrow and struggle with fate in that indeed our
passions make us all like one another.”</p>

<p>There remains one issue to be addressed. It is more or less commonly
believed that the castrato soprano sounded nothing like a falsetto soprano
(not to be confused with the modern countertenor—a different voice
altogether). Leaving aside the probability that castrati had as many different
kinds of vocal qualities as there were castrati—no “castrato sound” in that
sense—there is one description of Velluti’s singing that addresses precisely
this issue. On 7 July 1825, <i>The</i> <i>Dorset County Chronicle </i>wrote
(of the London première of Meyerbeer’s <i>Il Crociato </i>the previous week)
that “the voice of Signor Velluti is not easy satisfactorily to describe. It
is not a boy’s voice, nor a woman’s voice; it is not a <i>soprano</i>, nor a
counter-tenor, nor a treble. What approaches nearest to it in tone is a high
<i>falsetto </i>voice of a man, without much richness, but with compass,
power, and flexibility (emphases original).”</p>
