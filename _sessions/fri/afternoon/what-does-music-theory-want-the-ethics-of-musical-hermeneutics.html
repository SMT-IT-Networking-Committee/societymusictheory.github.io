<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>The relation between musical hermeneutics and music theory is longstanding
but not harmonious, shadowed by rivalries, disavowals, and breaks. There is no
interpretation without desire, and no desire without subjects. Perhaps
theory’s historical and recurring breaks with interpretation are also breaks
with—or repressions of—the subject. This panel explores these relationships
with the help of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>Most fundamentally, we want to ask: what does music theory want?
Psychoanalysis was from the start a hermeneutic practice and also a “science
of desire,” an attempt to understand the foundations, and the limits, of any
hermeneutic endeavor. This three-hour special session, sponsored by the
Psychoanalysis Interest Group, addresses this topic via six twenty minute
presentations, each followed by 5 minutes of Q &amp; A, with a formal response by
Professor Seth Brodsky (University of Chicago). The papers approach our topic
from a range of different angles, so as to bridge a gap we often see between
theoretical and analytical questions. The first three papers show how
psychoanalysis illuminates the nature of the musical object by addressing
issues of performance, work-ontology and music-text relationships. Turning
from the musical object towards the listener and the discipline, the second
half of the panel considers the practice of listening within clinical
psychoanalysis in tandem with the listening we do in music theory. As a whole,
the panel suggests that psychoanalysis can work within, through and alongside
music theory to reimagine the place of the listener-subject and the futures of
our discipline.</p>
