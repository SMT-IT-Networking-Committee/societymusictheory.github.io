<p class="abs-title">Gluck’s Timbral Effects and an Alternate Aesthetic of a Classic</p>
<p class="abs-author">Estelle Joubert (Dalhousie University)</p>

<p>In 1791 a reviewer in the <em>Neue Teutsche Merkur</em> contends that “Alceste is Gluck’s most sublime, accomplished masterpiece. All the power of harmony, of which a dying one is capable, he has put into it. The wind instruments in particular have incredible power and effect [<em>Wirkung</em>]; they shake up marrow and bone.” Further reports of shuddering effects, medically described, coupled with a novel use of orchestration permeate Gluck reception, calling into question our understanding of the premises for his prominent presence in the formation of the musical canon. A careful reading of late eighteenth-century German reception documents suggest that Gluck’s status as “great composer,” at least prior to 1800, had surprisingly little to do with “noble simplicity”—a hallmark of classicism— or early manifestations of a through-composed operatic ideal, as Wagner would later claim. What emerges instead is an image of an opera composer whose renown was achieved by sonic orchestral effects.</p>
<p>In this paper, I employ opera criticism as an entry point to recovering the materiality of sound in Gluck’s works. Recalling Frank Kermode’s foregrounding of pleasure (real or imagined) of an artistic experience as a key catalyst to collective ascriptions of value, I uncover a series of lively critical engagements connecting Gluck’s use of timbre with late eighteenth-century German musical aesthetics, ultimately leading to collective ascriptions of value. Drawing on E. Dolan’s and A. Davies’ work that connects the history of aesthetics with embodiment, I make a case for an alternate aesthetics of a late eighteenth-century musical classic, a work-concept driven by the materiality of sound rather than philosophical discourse. My paper traces an early critical debate in which an imaginary Orpheus models critical assessment of Gluck’s works, to comparisons of the composer’s operas to painting, and finally, Kirnberger’s sharp response to musical expression in Gluck’s operas, confirming that Gluck’s prowess in handling orchestration is the determining factor in establishing his renown. Ultimately, my paper reveals the crucial role of opera as a genre in aesthetic debates eventually culminating in canon formation.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Hearing the Enlightenment: Musical Affects and Mechanist Philosophy in Early Eighteenth-Century England and Scotland</p>
<p class="abs-author">Tomas McAuley (University of Cambridge)</p>

<p>That eighteenth-century musical thought was dominated by theories of musical affect has long been recognized. Scholars have stressed in particular the rhetorical underpinnings of such theories, thus connecting them to a venerable tradition while allowing nuanced examination of ongoing changes in their relation to that tradition. Such subtlety is invaluable, but risks overlooking a broader rupture in the intellectual life of this period: the emergence and widespread acceptance of mechanist philosophy. According to this new philosophy, whose dissemination was virtually synonymous with the spread of Enlightenment thought, events are caused not by final purposes, but rather by prior events in time. Weaving together musical, medical, and philosophical histories, this paper argues that mechanist philosophy transformed understandings of music’s affective force in the early eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The primary effects of mechanist philosophy were twofold. First, mechanism shifted attention increasingly towards the underlying causes of music’s affective power, such as the workings of the human nervous system, as opposed to the practical means of achieving such power. Second, justifications for using this power became—<em>contra</em> narratives of the eighteenth century as an age of ever-growing musical autonomy—increasingly focused on specific medical or ethical goals. My examples are from England and Scotland, habitually overlooked by recent scholarship, but crucibles of musical thought at this time. Specifically, I uncover the significance of Isaac Newton’s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (1687), especially its laws of motion, for Alexander Malcolm’s <em>Treatise of Music</em> (1721) and Richard Browne’s <em>Medicina Musica</em> (1729).</p>
<p>This is no story, however, of the meek submission of musical thought to the power of philosophy. Rather, I conclude by arguing that music itself was crucial for the development of mechanist philosophy, acting variously as inspiration, metaphor, and object of investigation. I draw my primary examples again from Newton, notably his <em>Opticks</em> (1704), alongside unpublished notes that shed new light on the evolution of his ideas. The paper thus builds on work by Riley (2004), Agnew (2008), and Verba (2013), in uncovering the influence of Enlightenment philosophy on musical thought, but takes a step further by showing also the significance of musical thought for Enlightenment philosophy.</p>


<p class="abs-title">“Such as the Mind Sees When It Hears”: The Rise of Word-Painting as a Tool for Expression</p>
<p class="abs-author">Catherine Motuz (McGill University)</p>


<p>In his <em>Utopia</em> (1516), Thomas More describes music’s power according to its mimetic capacity: “the fassion of the melodye dothe so represente the meaning of the thing, that it doth wonderfullye move, stirre, pearce, and enflame the hearers myndes.” By contrast, Ficino, at the end of the fifteenth century, attributes the power of music not to its ability to imitate, but its capacity to physically move the aerial spirit of the listener (Boccadoro and Jafflin, 2013). Scholars have noted shifts in musical aesthetics ca. 1500 (Wegman 2002, Cumming 2008), and Warwick Edwards has described the rise of word-painting as an early sixteenth-century phenomenon, but although word-painting as an expressive device has become one of the defining features of sixteenth-century polyphony, the cultural context that caused musical mimesis to become such an important an aesthetic principle has been largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Taking a cue from Glarean (1547), who describes Josquin as able “to place weighty matters before the eyes,” I investigate the growing importance of evoking mental imagery in both rhetorical and theological writings of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. First, I investigate the idea that orators elicit emotion through conveying imagery. Prominent in writings of Aristotle, Plato, and Quintilian, this idea permeates late fifteenth-century rhetorical treatises, in particular that of Rudolph Agricola (1443/4–85). Second, I examine the theological principle that it is possible to get closer to an understanding of God through visualization prompted by aural cues. This idea is current throughout the Middle Ages (Carruthers), originating in Augustine’s <em>De Trinitate</em>: “<em>God is light</em> not such as these eyes see, but such as the mind sees when it hears ‘He is truth.’” (VIII.1.3) Only in the sixteenth century, however, does it spread outside the monastery and become part of popular piety, as reflected in Loyola’s <em>Spiritual Exercises</em>, compiled in 1523. Finally, I argue that the growing preoccupation with mental imagery in the above fields provides a cultural context for the rise of word-painting as a tool for musical expression. I illustrate this discussion by drawing attention to instances of word-painting in settings of Psalm 130 by Josquin and Senfl.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Glass Music and the Virgin Warrior</p>
<p class="abs-author">Annette Richards (Cornell University)</p>

<p>On the Tuesday of Holy Week, 1806, Haydn’s <em>Seven Last Words</em> was performed in its full choral version at the Hoftheater in Vienna. The work was divided into two halves, its mid-point marked by an extraordinary musico-dramatic interlude. Interrupting these profound reflections on the ultimate Christian sacrifice, presumably between no. 4, “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?” and no. 5, “I thirst,” Joan of Arc appeared on stage. The actress portraying the heroic cross-dressing virgin soldier recited the famous first monologue from Schiller’s 1801 <em>Jungfrau von Orleans</em> to an accompaniment performed by the blind glass harmonica virtuosa Marianne Kirchgessner, in a melodrama composed for the occasion by Anton Reicha.</p>
<p>The decision to create a vitreous sonic halo for the Maid of Orleans, exploiting the harmonica’s reputation as an uncanny voice emanating from supernatural realms, seems to have been Kirchgessner’s own. Hers, too, was the potentially subversive choice of Joan of Arc as a central figure in her spectacularly successful run of concerts between 1804 and 1808, featuring compositions by Zumsteeg, Weber, Schmidt, and Reicha.</p>
<p>In 1813, the Joan of Arc craze of the previous decade culminated in the sensational death on the battlefield, at a crucial turning point in the Napoleonic wars, of Leonora Prohaska, thought to be a man until her comrades pulled open her coat to reveal her wound and her breasts. By then the glass harmonica’s appeal was waning and Kirchgessner, its greatest virtuosa, long dead. Yet when Beethoven imagined the final moments of Leonora Prohaska as a melodrama for glass harmonica and voice, Kirchgessner and her celebrated repertoire seem to seep back into the musical present.</p>
<p>This paper presents a collection of hitherto unknown Joan of Arc settings for glass harmonica, and their associated contemporary criticism. What was it about the music, myths, and unexpected political charge of the harmonica—its sonority simultaneously unsettling and beatific—that, for early nineteenth-century composers, players, and audiences, evoked the ghostly voice of Joan of Arc and fittingly hymned the heroic undertakings of virgins in male clothing?</p>
