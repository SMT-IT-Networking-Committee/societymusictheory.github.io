<p class="abs-title">De fundamento discanti</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ryan Taycher (Indiana University)</p>

<p>In learning to sing discant and studying treatises on the topic, choirboys of the fourteenth century would have often encountered the concept of the <em>fundamentum discanti</em>—“the foundation of discant.” A number of fourteenth-century treatises reference this concept, yet historical authors engaged it in differing ways. Some treatises, such as Jacobus’ <em>Speculum musicae</em> (Book VII), state that the tenor is the foundation of discant. However, early counterpoint treatises—such as “Cum notum sit” and Philipoctus de Caserta’s “Regule contrapuncti”—state that <em>contrapunctus</em> is the foundation of discant. But in what capacity does the tenor or <em>contrapunctus</em> function as the <em>fundamentum discanti</em> (never fully explained in the treatises), and what is the significance of these differing perspectives?</p>
<p>In order to explore this concept, I propose three categories of meaning for <em>fundamentum</em>: 1) the tenor is the foundation upon which discant is constructed; 2) <em>contrapunctus</em> is the foundation of discant as prerequisite knowledge; and 3) <em>contrapunctus</em> is the foundation of discant as a note-against-note framework that is ornamented. From this categorization, I will consider a gradual conceptual shift from the lower-voice chant serving as the foundation above which one discants to the upper-voice note-against-note framework serving as the foundation to be elaborated in discant. By recalibrating our understanding of the concept and function of <em>contrapunctus</em> at its origins as the <em>fundamentum discanti</em> and finding ways to discern the process of elaborating the note-against-note framework, we can better understand the compositional and improvisational processes conveyed in these treatises.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Maintaining a Point”: Repeated Motives over an Equal-Note Cantus Firmus from Josquin to Monteverdi</p>
<p class="abs-author">Peter Schubert (McGill University) and Julie Cumming (McGill University)</p>

<p>Many important Renaissance compositions use a technique in which a single motive is repeated against a melody in long equal note values. This presentation will explain the skills required to improvise “contraponto con obbligo,” showing two-voice examples by Ortiz, Lusitano, and Banchieri, and examples for more than two voices by Festa and others. The improviser must decide whether to derive his motivic material from the chant or to use some other popular or original tune. The singer can vary, truncate, or extend the motive, or, as Lusitano suggests, fill in between motives with fast scales (<em>tirate</em>). The best treatise examples of this practice are highly sophisticated and expressive works, using motivic development and contrapuntal variation to create small masterpieces. Roger North says in England, “the art was so farr advanced that divers would descant upon plainesong extempore together, . . . whole consorts for instruments of 4, 5 and six parts were solemnly composed, and with wonderfull Art and Invention...” To prove that present-day practitioners can add two lines to a cantus firmus (c.f.) extemporaneously, a video of a live concert performance will be shown. The presentation concludes with a discussion of where composition begins and improvisation ends, with examination of excerpts from Josquin’s <em>Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae</em> and the Monteverdi Vespers.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Tonality’s Missing Link: Text Setting and Metrical Regularity in Italianate Partsong at the Turn of the Seventeenth Century</p>
<p class="abs-author">Megan Kaes Long (Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory)</p>

<p>This paper explores the influence of metrically-determined text setting on the emergence of tonality in the early modern period. Recently, studies of early tonality have focused on pitch content: how modal collections relate to tonal scales or how triads shift from properties of counterpoint into actively-deployed compositional resources. Yet, the structures that regulate pitch content—meter, phrase structure, and form—play an equally crucial role in tonal languages. In vocal genres, these parameters originate in text setting, which, this paper demonstrates, has a surprisingly robust connection to tonal features. In a style that hinges on the meaning and structure of the text, line lengths determine phrase lengths, patterns of verbal accent dictate musical accent, and poetic form influences cadential rhetoric and formal boundaries. This paper uses Italian homophonic partsongs by Gastoldi, Vecchi, and Banchieri, and German and English adaptations of these partsongs by Hassler, Haussmann, Schein, Morley, and Weelkes to demonstrate how text setting contributes to the articulation of both metrical and tonal hierarchies.</p>
<p>The correspondence between emerging tonal and metrical languages in homophonic partsongs is not a coincidence. Rhythmic consistency, metrical periodicity, phrase structure, and repetitive formal structures—when coordinated with melodic and harmonic events that emphasize tonic and dominant—establish predictable musical patterns that encourage listeners to hear harmonic relationships on increasingly deep structural levels. Tonality and meter are mutually reinforcing parameters that both make increasingly large time spans comprehensible in hierarchical ways.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Tactical Approaches to <em>Tactus</em> in Praetorius and Burmeister: Differences in Their Rhetorical Understanding and Purpose</p>
<p class="abs-author">Layne Vanderbeek (University at Buffalo, SUNY)</p>

<p>This paper explores the treatment of rhythm, <em>tactus</em> and their signatures as discussed by Michael Praetorius and Joachim Burmeister. This paper will interpret these treatises as two unique theoretical stances that deal with the newfound freedoms of rhetorical expression and arrive at very different conclusions. The differences in approach partake in the long history of practice vs. theory that precedes these treatises. Praetorius presents the practical concerns of musical performance, Burmeister the theoretical concerns of creation.</p>
<p>Joachim Burmeister’s <em>Musica Poetica</em> of 1609 represents the compositional side of musical activity in the rhetorical tradition. His treatment of rhythm and tactus is cursory. He does not expressly limit the expression of rhythm and tactus, and by leaving the signification open to expansion Burmeister allows for creative elaboration. This freedom in the rhetorical model expressed itself in the proliferation of meter signatures that Praetorius found difficult to deal with in practice.</p>
<p>Michael Praetorius wrote <em>Syntagma Musicum</em> in 1619 as a treatise that targeted the proliferation of meter and <em>tactus</em> signatures that were used in a confusing and inconsistent manner within musical practice. His suggestion was to eliminate the majority of these signatures in favor of a much simpler apparatus that indicated note values and used Italian words to dictate any changes in desired tempo. In his treatise note values were determined by a consistent definition of length. Staves subject to varying <em>tactus</em> pulses were easily dealt with because note values would divide in a proportional manner that was easily decipherable.</p>
