<p>This panel brings together published scholars and editors invested in
securing minority representation in academic publishing. The conversation will
focus on the stakes of achieving racial diversity among editors in music
studies and those of creating more equitable structures by which scholars of
color have substantial opportunity to publish in music journals and books. It
is organized in collaboration with Project Spectrum
(<a href="//projectspectrummusic.com">projectspectrummusic.com</a>).</p>
