<p>This paper considers the aesthetic relationship between exotic dance and interwar jazz. I draw on a previously unexplored collection of interviews conducted in the 1980s and ’90s with black women performers and musicians who participated in the so-called “golden age” of Montreal jazz (1925–55). Given Montreal’s status as a “showtown,” the city is a particularly rich focal point for examining the constitutive relationship between exotic dance and interwar jazz. Specifically, these oral histories force a critical revision of the assumption that entertainers based their routines on a fixed and independent soundtrack provided by a jazz ensemble, and in doing so, they shed light on the dynamic collaborative process that led to each live performance.</p>
<p>The narratives articulated in these oral histories also allow us to move beyond questions of representation in scholarship on exotic jazz dance to consider issues of subjecthood and agency. Josephine Baker’s notorious eye-crossing and her parodic, end-of-the-chorus-line behavior has made it possible for scholars to identify in her performances the process of “signifying” on the stereotype of the primitive-exotic and thus to reclaim her work as modern art. What is less clear is how we are to account for the fifteen <em>other</em> chorus girls in the <em>Shuffle Along</em> line, those who wholeheartedly played up the stereotype of the primitive-exotic onstage which, in effect, granted Baker’s performance of critical distance its very legibility. My presentation will extend historical assessments of exotic jazz dancers by discussing two counter-mythologies that emerge from their testimonies: 1) their deep affective attachment to their creative labor, an immensely important historical signpost of what bell hooks has called “re-thinking the nature of work” for black working-class women; and 2) a sophisticated critique of the gendered and classist constraints of black respectability discourse, where upward mobility could only come at the expense of the erotic potential of their bodies. Following Audre Lorde, I argue that the harnessing of erotic power to access work that provided both a way out of poverty and a temporary escape from the multi-fragmenting trauma of hegemonic discourse should be understood as a critical black feminist strategy.</p>

<p>Prostitution was a booming American business from the 1840s to the 1910s. During this time, sex could be procured in dance halls, saloons, casinos, rathskellers, brothels, and many other such places. Since dancing was often an energetic prelude to sex, musicians learned how best to manipulate through sound the libidos of johns, all towards the best economic interests of the joint, the girls, and themselves. A conservative estimate is that during prostitution’s heyday, as many as half of the nation’s professional musicians were engaged in the service of commercialized sex.</p>
<p>This paper concerns prostitution and dance and music during a crucial period in New York’s history. A “Committee of Fourteen” civic-minded New Yorkers was formed in 1905 and self-charged with the mission of suppressing the city’s vice. By 1912, the Committee’s attention was focused sharply on the prostitution industry. It hired undercover investigators—black, white, male, female—and sent them into the city’s saloons, dance halls, brothels, and dives, from where they filed detailed reports on activities observed. Many thousands of those accounts, often quite graphic, are now archived in the New York Public Library and provide extraordinary first-hand insight into the era’s symbiotic relationships between sex, music, and dance.</p>
<p>The Committee’s work significantly reduced prostitution in New York by 1917, but also reshaped the city’s cultural, social, political, and sexual landscape along lines favored by the wealthy elite. Furthermore, cleansing the city of “public” prostitution also greatly reduced gigging opportunities for musicians, and thousands of New York’s professional musicians accordingly lost their jobs. Some of them reinvented their musical lives and brought their “old” underground music into the “new” bright public sphere. As a result, a long-established, wildly exciting “alleged” music that encouraged wildly exciting “rotten” dancing came to wide attention. It is no mistake that the music of “The Jazz Age” shares much in common with that of the antecedent demimonde, which was long practiced in the musical means for setting American blood on fire.</p>
