<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>The music and culture of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (“Renaissance music”) was underrepresented in the abstract pool of this year’s AMS meeting. The abstracts that were submitted, furthermore, did not talk to each other in predictable ways and it was difficult for the program committee to imagine organizing four-paper sessions devoted solely to music of this period. The committee therefore decided to invite a number of senior scholars who are working actively in these two centuries to share their work, and then to participate in an open discussion about the larger disciplinary trends with which their work engages. The session title is intended playfully to suggest that the period formerly known as the Renaissance might at the moment be more of a disciplinary “middle age” between the glorious intellectual and cultural achievements of the Ars antiqua, nova, and subtilior on the one hand, and the potent confluence of global expansion, colonial conquest, scientific and religious revolution, and hip self-fashioning of the “Early Modern” era on the other.</p>
<p>The five panelists (Bent, Bernstein, Freedman, Robertson, and Rodin) will each give a short presentation in which they offer a case study of their research and a sketch of its implications for the field as a whole. Kate Van Orden will give a formal response, and the final hour will be devoted to a round-table discussion among panelists and audience.</p>

<p class="abs-title">A Tale of Two Cities and Two Technologies: Shaping Music Books and Notes in Cinquecento Italy</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jane A. Bernstein (Tufts University)</p>

<p>Of all events that shaped the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the shift from manuscript to print most profoundly impacted European music and culture. Through the printing press, music books were generated more economically, more rapidly, and in greater quantity than previously envisioned. In Venice alone, nearly three thousand music editions survive. With press-runs ranging from five hundred to a thousand copies per title, an astounding 1.5 to 3 million volumes appeared over the course of the sixteenth century. From our modern perspective, this was a pivotal moment, since the production of music books on such a grand scale enabled the preservation of a vast number of musical works.</p>
<p>This paper concerns books as objects and what they tell us about the politics of music printing in Venice and Rome. It explores book forms and technologies utilized in the two publishing centers, focusing especially on two printing processes: single-impression movable type and copper-plate engraving. From there, it considers how these contrasting technologies influenced which musical genres and repertories made it into print and how this, in turn, has influenced the way we think about sixteenth-century music and the history of western music as a whole.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Chansonnier as Sensory Artifact</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jesse Rodin (Stanford University)</p>

<p>How can we make contact with lived musical experiences of the late-medieval period? Bereft of evidence, we understandably tend to generalize, contextualize, and sanitize. We insist on the limitations of our modernity. We lean heavily on the idea of cultural specificity, erecting intellectualized barricades between ourselves and our historical actors. Along the way we neglect music’s sensory and emotional power.</p>
<p>I suggest more can be done to bridge the epistemic gap. Taking as my point of departure the so-called Loire Valley chansonniers of the later fifteenth century, I argue that these books can help us access not only a general understanding of makers, readers, and courtly culture, but also a range of specific, time-bound musical utterances. The songs, and their texts, invite a new way of thinking about how books like these matter.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Musical Networks: Initiative, Patronage, and Humanism in the Early-Fifteenth-Century Veneto</p>
<p class="abs-author">Margaret Bent (All Souls College, Oxford)</p>

<p>In the course of establishing the intersecting circles in which the manuscript Bologna Q15 was compiled, I amassed a body of archival data on individual musicians, their interconnections between Padua, Vicenza and Venice, the multiple spheres of their activity, and the mix of individual enterprise, clerical employment and private support that led to a richer and more complex picture than a received view that has tended to emphasise controlling patronage by single prelates, princes or institutions. Although some manuscripts were commissioned, personally owned books and musical activity flourished alongside at the initiative of musicians themselves, albeit with benign support from bishops or cathedral chapters. The view that the learned intricacy of churchy, northern, gothic polyphony would not have been to the taste of Italian humanists is belied by its cultivation precisely by patrician bibliophiles and early readers of Greek; humanism was still primarily a literary agenda. There are connections, too, to the legacy of Petrarch. Many of the mini-biographies resulting from this work are pieced together from multiple sources, though still with unbridgeable gaps; many are of musicians whose names are new to scholarship because huge losses have deprived us of the music some of them undoubtedly composed. In this brief presentation, I will offer sample cherrypickings from these findings, in part to redeem the perception that archival work is mechanical or uncritical, and to show how such microhistorical investigation of individual cases, often between the cracks of institution-based studies, can offer some correctives to traditional generalizations about patronage.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Music, Words, and Meaning in the Fifteenth-Century Sacred Repertory</p>
<p class="abs-author">Anne Walters Robertson (University of Chicago)</p>

<p>Scholars have studied the development of sacred music in the fifteenth century from the viewpoints of institutions, musicians, repertories, rituals, archival documents, styles, sources, culture, and from many other perspectives. This same evolution is also often captured in another way: in the basic idea that the ancient medieval bond between music and number loosens during this period, and that a new alliance between music and words emerges. Words tell the history of musical institutions, words form the books that musicians read, words make up the texts of musical repertories, words delineate rituals, words comprise archival documents, words inspire musical styles, words fill musical sources, words shape culture.</p>
<p>This paper examines words that help define musical meaning in the fifteenth century. Words emphasized in sacred books often behave similarly in musical settings. Vernacular words provide new models for religious beliefs in music, enhancing its meaning. Words that explain philosophical concepts teach religious precepts in music. Words that inscribe new rituals share their novel configurations in these rites with the structures of musical compositions. Words that fetishize sacred objects sometimes inspire similarly obsessive techniques in music.</p>
<p>Examples by Dunstaple, Du Fay, Obrecht, and Josquin illustrate these points, signaling the multi-faceted interactions of music and words, along with a richer understanding of the well-known concept of music-as-rhetoric in the late middle ages.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Early Music in the Digital Domain: Texts and Roles</p>
<p class="abs-author">Richard Freedman (Haverford College)</p>

<p>Renaissance music has recently entered the digital age, with new tools that allow us to interrogate musical texts in new and exciting ways. <em>Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass</em> (CRIM) will take its place in this work, extending the idea of the quotable text for music in an innovative, open-source format. The focal point of our inquiry is the so-called “imitation” Mass, a Renaissance musical genre notable for the ways in which its composers derived new, large-scale works from pre-existing ones. Jointly directed by scholars from Haverford College and the Centre d’Études Supérieures de la Renaissance, CRIM will shed new light on relationships among these pieces, which on account of their complexity have largely remained beyond the capacity of any single scholar to command, and beyond the limits of conventional editions to convey. Through them we will enhance our understanding of changing approaches to composition, and the changing practice of <em>imitatio</em> in Renaissance Europe.</p>
<p>This rich weave of relationships seems particularly suited to the XML standard that serves as the basis of our digital editions: The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). Printed editions represent musical works in graphical form for use by performers and analysts. Logical encodings like those in MEI format open musical texts to many previously unmanageable research questions, thanks to their capacity for interrogation and citation. Through them we can cite relationships among Masses and their models. We will extend addressability to various commentaries that give meaning to the musical citations themselves via a participatory multi-author publication system using Linked Open Data technologies such as Open Annotation Collaboration.</p>
<p>Richly encoded digital texts also open up (and even demand) new opportunities for collaboration. Musicologists, like others who have begun to explore the digital domain, can find themselves in a workplace that looks increasingly like “big data” science and social science, with extended rings of collaborators, co-authored publications, and standardized methodologies. These developments will affect musicology as a whole. But those of us concerned with early music are well poised to take notice of them, and to take the lead in thinking about their implications for the futures of the discipline.</p>
