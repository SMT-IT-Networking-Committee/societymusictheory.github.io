<p class="abs-title">Susanna’s “Deh vieni”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Paul Sherrill (Indiana University)</p>

<p>On the threshold of the Act IV Finale to <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i>, Susanna sings the serenade “Deh vieni non tardar.” Like Don Giovanni’s “Deh vieni alla finestra,” Susanna’s “Deh vieni” is a “phenomenal” performance sung to beguile a diegetic listener. Unlike Giovanni’s serenade, however, Susanna’s aria sounds different to the audience than it does to Figaro: the aria we hear differs from the serenade Figaro hears in the way that secco recitative differs from the spoken dialogue it represents. This paper argues that the distance between Figaro’s “Deh vieni” and ours is the essential medium of the aria: its expansion and contraction is the dimension in which the aria’s expressive trajectory is traced. Through it the aria represents a musicalized version of Susanna’s performative act, not simply a phonographic reproduction of her song.</p>
<p>This analysis traces the relationship between our changing sense of what the music is and the meanings that might be imputed to its specific details. In particular, cadences initially serve as neutral markers of the lyrical time of Susanna’s serenade, but as the number’s distance from the phenomenal song increases they become elusive goals in a tonal drama. This change, undergirded by parallel changes in orchestration and hypermeter, leads to a series of cadenza-like ruptures in the aria’s temporality: swept up in the moment Susanna nearly lets the performance stumble into silence. Like Schubert’s Gretchen at the spinning wheel, she haltingly resumes the charade, recalling the trappings of Figaro’s serenade to complete the structural cadence.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Where’s That Vocal Entry? Metric and Hypermetric Play in
  Benjamin Britten 1943–1945</p>
<p class="abs-author">Stuart Duncan (Yale University)</p>

<p>Benjamin Britten’s vocal music of 1943–1945 represents an apex in the composer’s captivation with metric conflict. <i>The Ballad of Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard</i> (1943), <i>the Holy Sonnets of John Donne</i> (1945), and <i>Peter Grimes </i>(1945), diverse in their musical construction and distinct in the types of texts set, share a central compositional concern: the employment of sustained metric conflict as a means of emphasizing structural junctures or poetic ideas. Although this music has been the subject of form- and pitch-based analyses (Whittall, Stroeher, Rupprecht), it has yet to be examined from a metric perspective.</p>
<p>This paper explores how vocal entries problematize meter, generating local and hypermetric conflicts with the accompaniment for expressive and text-interpretative purposes: in <i>Musgrave</i>, metric conflict acts as a commentary on Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard’s intention to fulfill their illicit affair; in the <i>Holy Sonnets</i>, metric conflict intensifies the relationship between the sonnet’s protagonist (often considered as Donne himself) and the antagonists of sin, death, and an impending Day of Judgment; and, in <i>Peter Grimes</i>, the metric stability of the Borough’s “Old Joe has Gone Fishin’” is disrupted as Grimes enters mid tune, reinforcing his alienation from the Borough. These analyses demonstrate the strength of a metric-based approach on a new body of musical works, not only providing fresh insights into Britten’s texted music, but also laying the foundation for further research into notated versus perceived meter in twentieth-century music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Musical Gestures of Beijing Opera and Chen Yi’s Work</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nancy Yunhwa Rao (Rutgers University)</p>

<p>As important social memory, an indispensible source of inspiration for many contemporary Chinese composers is Beijing Opera. The sonority can be heard frequently through musical gestures such as percussion idioms (<i>luogu dianzi)</i>, melodic phrases, vocal timbre, and dramatic sequence. Linking Chen Yi’s adaptation of traditional rhythmic patterns and melodic idioms to her musical expression, this paper considers how the rich sonority of her work navigates through a kind of cultural translation.</p>
<p>Musical gestures connected to <i>luogu dianzi </i>are always associated with particular meaning and bodily movement in Beijing opera. Their use in Chen Yi’s Symphony No. 2 helps to create a listening experience ripe with potential for emotional and physical engagement. These gestures can elicit an embodied listening, and the culturally coded gestures lead to particular effects. I propose that the dynamic exertion implied by such gestures can be experienced by listeners on a physical level, through a kind of “visceral imitation.” In her <i>Jing Marimba, </i>on the other hand, characteristic melodic elements are used together with the golden mean to shape musical gestures in a different way. Their appearances range widely: from obvious, immediate surface to subtle, distanced background, and in forms of either raw energy or specific cultural reference. In some cases, the musical phrasing of the gestures also mimics the temporal articulation and physical movement characteristic of the opera stage. Yet regardless of form or referential association, these gestures shape the temporal process and emotive content of her work.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Tarnhelm + Tannhäuser = Tristan</p>
<p class="abs-author">Scott Murphy (University of Kansas)</p>

<p>Among the innumerable analyses of the opening measures of Wagner’s <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, only the present study proposes an understanding of both this opening and its extra-musical associations as a merger of other structural-semiotic bonds formed in the composer’s preceding works. This understanding transplants a certain paradox of structure, demonstrated by Richard Cohn to undergird the magical “Tarnhelm” progression among others, from the domain of intervallic diatonicity and non-diatonicity to the domain of acoustic consonance and dissonance. In this new domain, this same paradoxical structure lies at the heart of another signature Wagnerian progression, exemplified by the “Sirens” music from <i>Tannhäuser</i>. The most common and distinctive association for this melodic-harmonic complex is amorousness, an association that extends into music after <i>Tannhäuser</i>: other music dramas of Wagner, certain nineteenth-century French and Italian operas, and certain twentieth-century films. As Cohn enlists Freudian psychology to support his homology, Adorno essentially does the same when he describes the pleasure that lies in the tension of the Sirens-related “Lenzgebot” leitmotif from <i>Meistersinger</i>, a view that parallels one of Freud’s views of sexual excitation.</p>
<p>The opening of <i>Tristan</i> exhibits this same paradox of structure in both diatonic and acoustic domains, synthesizing a coordinated interaction of energetics within each of the “Tarnhelm” and <i>Tannhäuser</i> progressions. This structural union corresponds with a semantic amalgamation of the otherworldliness and sexual desire with which these two kinds of music are respectively associated, matching a signifier of love that is potion-induced or death-devoted.</p>
