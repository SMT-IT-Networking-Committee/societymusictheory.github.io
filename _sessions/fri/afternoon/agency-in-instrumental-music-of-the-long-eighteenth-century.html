<p>Attributing agency in the art of music is a tricky enterprise. Monahan 2013 has recently pointed out how undertheorized this area is, and how loosely we often conceive of who is doing what when musicking occurs. This panel extends the range of enquiry of the existing literature, which has tended to focus on Romantic repertory. Eighteenth-century music engages agency at several levels: actual performers, the sociability actualized by these exchanges, and the virtual agency they imply. Historical accounts of agency in music may be found in the writings of eighteenth-century theorists, but more recent scholarship on performative rhetoric, improvisation, and virtual agency adds complementary perspectives on the cueing and embodiment of agency by both composers and performers. The four papers explore these issues, moving from historical to speculative, from determinate to indeterminate, and from performative to compositional.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Koch and Momigny: Theorists of Agency in Mozart’s Quartets?</p>
<p class="abs-author">Edward Klorman (McGill University)</p>

<p>This paper examines historical writings about the “Classical” string quartet, a genre frequently compared to artful conversation. Such metaphors implicitly interpret each instrumental part (or player) as representing distinct characters. This concept of multiple personas contrasts sharply with the monological personifications advanced in many recent writings on musical agency, such as Cone’s <em>The Composer’s Voice</em> (1974), which posits a “central intelligence” representing the “mind” of the composition, its fictional protagonist, or its composer.</p>
<p>Focusing on discussions of Mozart’s quartets in Koch’s <em>Versuch</em> and Momigny’s <em>Cours complet,</em> I examine to what extent the instrumental personas postulated by each author constitute genuine musical <em>agents</em>, considering (1) whether personas are described as possessing such anthropomorphic qualities as sentience, volition, and emotion, and (2) whether they are described as possessing agential autonomy and a capacity for independent action or utterance.</p>
<p>Koch describes the string quartet as comprising four main parts (<em>Hauptstimmen</em>) that constantly exchange roles and of which none claims the ancestral privilege of being the main melody (<em>Vorrecht der Hauptmelodie</em>). Koch explicitly equates the concept of <em>Hauptstimme</em> with personhood and describes a rivalry (<em>Wettstreit</em>) among the parts.</p>
<p>Momigny’s analysis of K. 421 famously recasts Mozart’s quartet as an aria for Dido (first violin), with a minor part for Aeneas (fleetingly represented by the cello). Although Momigny’s musical score would seem to relegate the lower three parts to an exclusively accompanimental status, his prose commentary reveals a more nuanced understanding, particularly in passages in which contrapuntal imitation and textural independence prompt protoagential interpretations.</p>

<p>The individualization of motive represents a striking development in the music of the later eighteenth century. While motives are certainly recognizable as such earlier than this time, they are less “characteristic,” partly because they are embedded in a more continuous brand of musical syntax (so-called <em>Fortspinnung</em>), and partly because they tend to be rhythmically more homogeneous. In the later eighteenth century, though, aided by a growing taste for periodic phrase structures, motives can “stand out from the crowd,” and become agents of a new, listener-oriented sense of musical process. This individuality extends beyond their local make-up to the ways in which they behave on a larger scale; they may be subject to change over the course of a movement, either in their form or in their placement relative to other materials. Such unpredictability may foreground the agency of the composer, whose persona can intrude in a way that is historically quite novel, most famously in the case of Haydn. But it can also do something quite different, and possibly contradictory—create the impression that the material concerned has taken on a life of its own. Movements such as Haydn’s quartet op. 64/1/4 and Mozart’s violin sonata K. 301/1 enact a contemporary ideal of versatility, whether understood discursively (seeing an idea from different angles) or more simply behaviorally (fulfilling different roles according to circumstances). In either case, the sense of the material as an autonomous entity is strengthened, complicating ideas about musical agency, or “where the music is coming from.”</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Agency of the Performer in Mozart’s C-minor Fantasia K. 475</p>
<p class="abs-author">Mary Hunter (Bowdoin College)</p>

<p>Musicological and music-theoretical discussion of agency tends to cluster around the composition “itself,” that is around the composer, the “work persona” (Monahan), and the various elements of the work that act on and with each other. Here I deal with the question of actual human agency in the form of the performer. Performers are obviously agents with every choice they make, but I suggest that there are different kinds of agency, some perceptible to the audience as agency and some not.</p>
<p>Fantasias present a particularly interesting case study in performative agency because their improvisational “work personae” present the composer/protagonist as the ideal performer. One might argue that the agency of the actual performer is demonstrated in the way he or she emphasizes the most “improvisational” elements of the composition—that is, both the unexpected juxtapositions and the devolutions into conventional sequential passagework. On the other hand, such emphases could also be read as only weakly agential (perhaps more about performance as a topos than about the particular performer) because they obey the overriding improvisational topos of the work. And on yet a third hand, a performer might make such striking choices (whether in the overtly improvisational sections or not) that listeners become particularly aware of his or her individual agency.</p>
<p>I examine three performances (Richter, Yudina and Bezuidenhout) of the C minor Fantasy, K. 475, which exemplify different relations between the agency of the “ideal performer” work-persona and that of the actual player.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Agentially and Expressively Motivated Counterpoint</p>
<p class="abs-author">Robert S. Hatten (University of Texas at Austin)</p>

<p>Exploring unusual counterpoints in works of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I offer an explanatory model that gives increased priority to expressive agential motivations over structural compliance with contrapuntal rules (or generic expectations for countersubjects). I begin with Bach’s innovative “refractive counterpoint” in which countersubjects are clearly derived from the subject, helping promote the merger of three lines into a unified expressive result—in effect, a singular subjectivity. “Topically oppositional counterpoint,” on the other hand, illustrates how underlying parallel-third scaffolding can help support a more tropological merger into a singular agential expression. Classical counterpoint achieves a similar merger of more complementary material by scaffolding uses of parallel thirds, sixths, and tenths, coordinating melody and accompaniment textures into a singular agency. Finally, in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, the bassoon counterpoint to the strings’ sounding of the “Freude” hymn exhibits highly erratic contrapuntal behavior, with numerous “rule violations,” but those violations may be shown to have a compelling dialogical motivation in the virtual interaction of an enlightened individual with a communal voice.</p>
