<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>The topic of Western music and Empire has received increasing critical attention. Numerous publications (Richards, 1993; Born and Hesmondhalgh, 2000; Clayton and Zon, 2007) have engaged with such themes as intercultural exchange and postcolonial theory. Yet further, perhaps more controversial, questions of research practice—notably, issues surrounding “the Archive”—remain to be explored. To what extent can the music historian posit a palpable connection between “imperial sounds” on the one hand, and the politics of race, gender, and social relations on the other? How useful is the available and oft-patchy evidence? The documented fate of musical sounds in the past, coupled with the complexity of surviving sources in the present, merits closer scrutiny. Highlighting the Archive as a reflexive and mediated system of knowledge (Stoler, 2009), this session will present fresh observations on Western musical culture in diverse settings of colonial and imperial encounter.</p>
<p>By interrogating Western music and Empire through sound and the Archive, this session will explore new definitions of “aural history” and scholarship as a form of historical listening. We will propose multiple, further directions in terms of how musicology can fruitfully mediate between postcolonial theory, extant data, and the very act of interpretation.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Singing of Lovedale in London: Mobilizing the Archival Imaginary</p>

<p>For musicologists, grappling with the imperial archive entails a multitude of challenges: reimagining the aural experience of colonial music-making for both coloniser and colonized, in addition to considering the imperial legacy of the Western archive itself. Moreover, while the allure of conducting archival research in exotic locations still attracts researchers today, the increased presence of online resources, and the fact that many imperial archives are often held within their Western former imperial centers, simultaneously expands and limits the act of research, and puts pressure on continuing questions about race and the authority of knowledge. To present a case study, a substantial amount of archival material relating to the Mission Station of Lovedale, South Africa—a fascinating location of colonial music-making that has subsequently been labelled a site of deeply “coercive” evangelization (Duncan, <em>Lovedale: Coercive Agency</em>, 2003)—are presently located in the archives of the British Library and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. Notably, while certain extant material relating to mission hymn-singing still resides in South African archives, much musicological scholarship pertaining to this location references the collections available in London. While much of this situation may be rationalized by Western-centric limitations of geographical accessibility, the contemporary archival endeavour as an act of the continued neo-imperial centralization of knowledge is open to serious critique. As Thomas Richards has written at the opening of <em>The Imperial Archive</em> (1993), “an Empire is partly a fiction.” In this formulation, Western definitions of Empire have often been based on historical material that is habitually exoticized and reified in the archive for post-imperial inspection. This paper draws upon primary source material from the Lovedale Collections in London to contextualize and problematize portrayals of race and music as played out through the imperial archive, proposing that to view these collections as part of a perpetuated narrative of Eurocentric knowledge provides a broader social picture of the fantasy of racialized sound. I will also examine the British reception of the colonial archive in the long nineteenth century, posing the question of how imperial curation might limit a collective understanding of the Other.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“A Strange Monotonous Air”: Sound and the Cape Colony, ca.1550–1854</p>
<p class="abs-author">Philip Burnett (University of Bristol)</p>

<p>The writings of European explorers to the African continent abounded in sounds and silences. In the era before audio recording technology, Africa’s sonic properties were transmitted through a variety of writings. The “new worlds” explored by Europeans were often made most vivid to their readership through the sounds that were both inscribed and described. But while they captured and described certain sounds, they also silenced others. What role did sound play in colonial travel writing and how did it help to form the consciousness of the colonial? Travelogues transmitted selected information about colonial lands. As such they represent an archive which from its inception was available to the public, as opposed to institutions, and assisted with the construction of the colonial in the public mind (see Penn<em>, Mapping the Cape</em>, 1993). During recent decades, scholars of historical ethno/musicology have increasingly widened the archival trove to include nonmusical sources—such as travelogues—in order to habilitate the soundworlds of the past (Wade, <em>Imaging Sound</em>, 1998; Rath, <em>How Early America Sounded</em>, 2003; Tomlinson, <em>Singing of the New World</em>, 2007). Despite the inevitable obstacles of prejudice and race type-casting, the ears of travel writers constitute a substantial and potentially rich archival source from which to draw in order to examine colonial aurality.</p>
<p>Taking the historical tension between sound and silence as a starting point, this paper traces travellers and explorers who listened to and wrote about the Cape Colony between ca. 1550 and 1854. It explores how people listened historically, and what we can learn about the musical values of these historical characters and their society to argue that aurality was used by Europeans and non-Europeans alike to define their cultural territory (Smith, <em>Sensory History</em>, 2007). Despite the profound aural distinctiveness of colony and metropole, both were interconnected and conditioned each other. Ultimately, this paper contributes towards the study of aurality and new world encounters by demonstrating that European explorers were highly aware of their soundscapes and used them to construct, comprehend, and define the peoples and landscapes they encountered.</p>

<p>“[M]usicology is or could be, in many instances, a significantly ‘data richer’ field than we generally give it credit for,” observe Clarke and Cook (2004). This statement is arguably true with regard to 1930s and ’40s Shanghai, a volatile period that witnessed foreign-and-Chinese jurisdictions, Japanese occupation, and the Communist takeover in 1949. Researchers in the present day benefit from fairly open and digitized access; primary sources in such languages as Chinese, English, French, German, and Russian; and numerous repositories, for example the Shanghai Municipal Archives, Shanghai Symphony Archives, and a handful of smaller district archives previously closed to the public. The wealth of so-called raw data has facilitated various histories of Shanghai in the early decades of the twentieth century. However, scholars have largely focused on native cultural discourse (Lee, <em>Shanghai Modern</em>, 1999; Jones, <em>Yellow Music</em>, 2001). Somewhat neglected, given Shanghai’s multinational demographic in the 1930s and ’40s, is the available evidence of Western musical sound: materials originally associated with foreign municipal and military presences in the city, which fortuitously fell into Communist hands. How might these materials—British, French, and Japanese colonial documents in Chinese Communist archives—inform an alternative history, an aural history that ventures beyond such rehearsed themes as cross-cultural encounter?</p>
<p>This paper navigates the surviving evidence through three case studies. The first considers alfresco soundings of the British-administered Shanghai Municipal Brass Band and the (ir)relevance of “Empire.” The second examines the social soundscape of the French Concession, teasing out the curious contradiction between colonial licensing on the one hand and quasi-Parisian nightlife on the other. The third discusses the perplexing soundworld of <em>Unterhaltungsmusik</em> in Japanese-occupied Shanghai: how and why Austro-German Jewish refugees were able to operate their own cafés and entertainment despite and amid military segregation. The case studies expose oft-conflicting sets of historical data, thereby highlighting a striking disparity between source types and repositories in Shanghai. Broadening out from aural history to the doing of aural history, the paper ponders the very texture of colonial documents in the communist archival sphere, and by extension, the audibility of the city’s musical past.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Imperial Constructions of 1950s Guyana: Alan Bush’s <em>The Sugar Reapers</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Joanna Bullivant (University of Oxford)</p>

<p>In the late 1950s, the English communist composer Alan Bush determined to write an opera about the struggle for independence then occurring in British Guiana, Britain’s only South American colony. In 1959, he travelled to the colony with a tape recorder in order to gain first-hand experience of Guyanese musical life, and subsequently used the material to compose <em>The Sugar Reapers</em>, which was staged in Leipzig in 1966.</p>
<p>This story offers a fascinating vignette of imperial intercultural exchange, and one which raises key questions of how to mediate between the sounds of the past and the surviving sources of the present. The sounds Bush heard, even mediated through his own recordings, are lost. What remains is a rich paper record of his journey and his use of Guyanese music in the opera in his sketches, surviving letters, and the testimony of Bush’s daughter who accompanied him. Of obvious concern is the fact that these sources are exclusively British, and, as shall be demonstrated, there is ample evidence of Bush’s processes of selection and his desire to seek an idealized Guyanese national music through his research. However, what shall also be highlighted is the fact that Bush worked personally with prominent pro-independence figures in Guyana, and that his aims in the opera intersected with ambitions in the country to forge a modern identity that transcended class and ethnic divisions. To complicate the imperial relations surrounding the opera further, Bush, as a communist, was both an avowed anti-colonialist and subject to discrimination by the colonial authorities in the course of his trip. Moreover, the opera was commissioned by, and performed in, East Germany, an anti-colonial nation struggling with its own imperial legacy. An East German recording of the opera is one of the few aural records of Bush’s encounter with Guyana that is extant.</p>
<p>Bush’s opera is, consequently, a case study which complicates a narrative of imperial construction and appropriation of the colonial Other, which raises questions about the place of the Archive in reinforcing or challenging this narrative.</p>
