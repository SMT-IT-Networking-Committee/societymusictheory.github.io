<p class="abs-title">Fighting for the “Dignity of a Creator”: Schoenberg, Lieberson, and the First Recording of <em>Pierrot lunaire</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Mary Jones (Yale University)</p>

<p>In January 1941 Goddard Lieberson, then a young producer at Columbia Records, wrote to Arnold Schoenberg about the planned release of <em>Pierrot lunaire</em> on a set of four 78-rpm discs—the first commercial recording of that work. By July of that year, however, a simple conversation about the logistics of securing a translation of the poetry for the album’s liner notes had become a heated debate about artistic commitment, the role of producers in the recording industry, arts advocacy in consumer culture, and the business of music. The letters between the two men—a fiery exchange on both sides—illustrate how highly charged the process of preparing a Columbia recording could be. (Schoenberg: “I am an example of those men in musical history, who since Mozart and Beethoven fought for the dignity of a creator . . . men who will not bow to the might of position or money; men who renounce success if it is combined with concession.”)</p>
<p>In addition to making several of these letters public for the first time, my paper goes on to discuss larger issues within the American recording industry of the era: competing interests within Columbia’s management structures, conflicting aesthetic goals between the composer and the industry, and the personal agendas of everyone involved. (In the following decades, for instance, Lieberson would go on to assume a prominent place at Columbia, rising through the ranks to become Executive Vice President and then President of the firm, with his hand in hundreds of recording projects.) A study of the Schoenberg-Lieberson correspondence forces open the seemingly direct connection between a composer and a finished record. The manufacturing of such a commercial product was a highly involved process, and Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory is a particularly attractive methodology through which to explore it. As one of the important but often overlooked actors filling this gap, Lieberson was caught between business and artistic forces, and the final recorded products emerged from a tangle of intentions and obligations. My paper establishes a foundation for a more nuanced, internally networked history of recording practices.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Constructing Cab Calloway</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nate Sloan (Stanford University)</p>

<p>During the boom of Harlem nightlife in the 1920s and 30s, certain cabarets like the Cotton Club (1926–36) maintained an infamous door policy. Though located deep in the heart of what James Weldon Johnson called “black Manhattan,” the Cotton Club only admitted white clientele. With residencies by luminaries such as Duke Ellington, the club sold hot rhythm, licentious dance routines, and, if you knew how to ask, illicit booze—but principally it sold the experience of <em>Harlem</em>. White “slummers” who ventured up to Lenox Avenue could have gotten the same kicks at Broadway venues booking African American acts, but the exciting frisson produced by crossing a threshold into Harlem’s black metropolis proved a priceless draw.</p>
<p>This paper analyzes the construction of one Cotton Club star, Cab Calloway, in order to retrace the connection between music and place during the moment of Harlem’s vogue. Calloway’s distinctive sound and persona supported his outsize role as an “in-between” figure in jazz, mediating through radio, records, film, and print an imagined encounter between white America and black Harlem. Press materials by his manager, Irving Mills, reinforced this identity, focusing on Calloway’s jive lexicon, “high yaller” skin tone and sartorial innovations in order to market the “hi-de-ho man” as an ambassador from Harlem subculture to the mainstream. Calloway’s music bolstered his turn as the “Harlemaestro,” beginning with his breakout hit “Minnie the Moocher” (1931). “Minnie’s” dark, minor-key soundworld and coded lyrics established a palette for Calloway metonymic of Harlem’s notorious nightlife, one expanded through a series of follow-up compositions, film vehicles and even cameos in Betty Boop cartoons. From their perch at the Cotton Club, Calloway and Mills inflected jazz discourse by playing off the real and imagined geography of Manhattan’s black “city within a city.” Examining their careful branding process gives new insight into the development of early New York jazz and one of its most understudied musicians.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Defining Impressions: Franz Liszt’s Press Kits and the New German Authorship</p>
<p class="abs-author">Oren Vinogradov (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)</p>

<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century, many composers struggled to redefine their relationship with contemporary audiences. As composers experimented with new roles as critics and philosophers, increased attention was placed on how composers defined their own musical practice. Some composers attempted to control their own reception in the press as part of a systematic effort to alter the listening public’s tastes. In the German states this trend was especially pronounced in the emerging debate over program music. As Nicholas Vazsonyi has shown, composers like Richard Wagner began to recruit critics in attempts to build powerful media brands in support of their music—a brand rivaled only by the machine engineered around Franz Liszt.</p>
<p>For some of the premieres to his symphonic poems, Liszt sent ahead press kits for unaffiliated newspapers to run, a ready-made parcel for drumming up ticket sales; many kits were cobbled together from Liszt’s own writing alongside explanatory texts by collaborators. My study indicates that although these kits were presented as unified programs, their contents express a diverse range of views on what, precisely, constituted the core experience of listening to programmatic music. By extension, these texts appear to critique where authorship lies when persons other than the composer determine the work’s program. Focusing on the kit for the premiere of Liszt’s <em>Dante Symphony</em>, I show how a recurrent interest in redefining the programmatic composer as a tone-poet (<em>Tondichter</em>) was used by these critics to explore a broad spectrum of theories about musical experience and temporal epistemology. I further suggest that the specific rhetorics used to promote Liszt’s program music were more politically fraught within the New German School than previously described. Through disentangling Liszt’s collaborators from one another, I argue that many of the discrepancies between items within these programs evidence an emergent struggle over differing notions of not only composers, but also critics, and how the act of criticism could fundamentally influence the perception of programmatic music. In doing so, my study provides a deeper understanding of how musical criticism functioned as philosophical inquiry in mid-nineteenth-century German culture.</p>

<p class="abs-title"><em>Beyoncé</em>: How Viral Techniques Circulated a Visual Album</p>
<p class="abs-author">Paula Harper (Columbia University)</p>

<p>On 13 December 2013, fans of pop superstar Beyoncé Knowles awoke to social media feeds populated by a potent contagion: literally overnight, the “visual album” <em>Beyoncé</em> exploded from heavily cloaked secrecy to viral ubiquity. The album dominated the visual real estate of the iTunes Store and overwhelmed social media platforms; fans’ resulting purchases totaled over 800,000 album sales in three days.</p>
<p>This paper sets two strands of interrogation into dialogue. First, I consider the curious object <em>Beyoncé</em>, a pop culture product that, in the first wave of viral immediacy, could only be acquired as a holistic entity, an ordered array of music videos and audio tracks—exclusively available via iTunes. Only through the establishment of this circumscribed set of purchasing options could <em>Beyoncé</em> ’s producers realize and market such a seemingly contradictory product: a superstar’s massively produced “concept album,” promoted nevertheless on a platform of unmediated “honesty.” <em>Beyoncé</em> ’s irregular pop song forms and haunting audiovisual tropes—from trophies and lollipops to sampled sounds of Knowles’s family and past—suggest an interconnectedness and overarching artistic vision atypical of female pop productions. Such a suggestion, I argue, was largely enabled by the unlikely, even contradictory reframings of intimacy, authenticity, and immediacy afforded by emergent viral techniques.</p>
<p>Secondly, this paper explicates the assemblage of devices, software, and human action that enabled the riotous commercial success of <em>Beyoncé</em>. It sketches out a twenty-first-century reception history that draws on theorizations of media and bodily “techniques” from Taina Bucher, Kate Crawford, danah boyd, and others, construing the networks and planes of social media as key sites of circulation, discourse, and meaning-making. I consider the particular affordances of feed-based social media like Twitter and Facebook, as well as the techniques with which users encountered and engaged them—together constituting a distinct mode of apprehending and participating in a 2013 viral “now.” However, despite the novel apparatus of circulation, this paper pushes against a reading of the <em>Beyoncé</em> release as a groundbreaking rupture with traditional album release tactics, demonstrating instead the deft ways in which viral logics and pathways were co-opted into extant music industry frameworks.</p>
