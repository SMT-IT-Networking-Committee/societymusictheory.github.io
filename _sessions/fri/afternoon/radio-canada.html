<p class="abs-title">Radio Orchestras and the Cultivation of a National Music Culture: The CBC Vancouver Chamber Orchestra, 1938–2008</p>
<p class="abs-author">Robert Bailey (University of Calgary)</p>

<p>European radio orchestras, particularly those in Germany, England, and elsewhere, have long been recognized for their patronage of contemporary music. In the absence of economic concerns, such as ticket sales, that affect the programming policies of traditional concert orchestras, radio orchestras run by state-funded broadcasters have the liberty of programming modern works that would not normally entice a large audience to the concert hall. Further to that point, radio orchestras typically have ample rehearsal time in which to prepare performances of even the most challenging of avant-garde symphonic works—a luxury very rarely availed to publicly concertizing orchestras.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important is the fact that many of the broadcasting companies which support radio orchestras have taken it upon themselves to commission and subsidize the creation of new works. In Canada following the end of the Second World War, this task was taken up in earnest by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In addition to a wide range of works for soloists, choirs, and chamber ensembles, numerous symphonic works were commissioned by the CBC for performance by its own permanent studio orchestras.</p>
<p>This paper will examine radio orchestras in the context of twentieth century Canadian cultural history. Unlike European nations with rich, established musical heritages, the works commissioned from Canadian composers for CBC radio orchestras formed a core part of a nascent musical repertoire in a young nation searching for a cultural identity. To explain the role that these studio orchestras served in the cultivation of Canadian music, I will focus on the CBC Vancouver Chamber Orchestra, which performed from 1938 to 2008—the longest operating radio orchestra in North American history. (In its final years it was known simply as the CBC Radio Orchestra). Having both predated and outlived its sister orchestras, the CBC Vancouver Chamber Orchestra provides an illuminating lens through which to understand the evolution of the CBC’s commissioning policies, as well as the challenges that faced the development of serious music in an emerging nation.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Stravinsky Venture: Igor Stravinsky and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1961–62</p>

<p>In August 1961, Glenn Gould introduced Igor Stravinsky and Robert Craft to John Roberts, a producer with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the trio set in motion ambitious efforts to bring Stravinsky to Toronto, Canada. Stravinsky’s relationship with the CBC proved one of the most creatively fruitful of his final years, particularly his collaborations with the CBC’s symphony orchestra and with the Elmer Eisler Singers. Working closely with these ensembles, Stravinsky recorded the final versions of his <em>Symphony of Psalms</em> as well as some of his late serial works, such as <em>A Sermon, A Narrative, and A Prayer</em>. In addition to granting interviews and conducting concerts, Stravinsky assisted the CBC in producing documentaries, including “Stravinsky at 80,” which many consider a definitive source on the composer. Stravinsky’s presence in Toronto fundamentally altered the place of the arts in the city.</p>
<p>Nuanced accounts of Stravinsky’s time in Toronto are missing from the scholarly literature, although both Stephen Walsh and Jonathan Cross touch upon these visits briefly in their work. Turning to John Roberts’s newly accessible archives, I reconstruct the details of the first cluster of Stravinsky projects initiated by the CBC from the perspective of its Canadian producers. John Roberts planned for three events in 1962 (a radio documentary, a television documentary, and a public concert), all designed to celebrate Stravinsky’s eightieth birthday. I present these events to allow for a reconsideration of the Canadian talent involved and a reconstruction of the inner workings of the CBC in the early 1960s. Indeed, witnessing these events from behind the scenes allows one to understand the hidden missteps and highly publicized successes that occurred as administrators cobbled the projects together. Overall, I argue that the events of 1962 were for the CBC as much about celebrating Stravinsky’s monumental importance to the field of twentieth-century music as they were about forging a specifically Canadian narrative—one that established the immense talent of Canadian performers, the quality of Toronto’s music-loving public, and the notion of Toronto as a thriving cultural center worthy of international renown.</p>
