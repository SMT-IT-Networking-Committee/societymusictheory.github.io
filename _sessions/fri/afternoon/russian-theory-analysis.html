<p class="abs-title"><i>Ein russischer Ursatz?</i>: Structural Layers in a Chopin
  Analysis by Sergei Protopopov</p>
<p class="abs-author">Philip Ewell (Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center)</p>

<p>Boleslav Yavorsky, with his disciple, Sergei Protopopov, had a profound impact on music theory in Russia. Their Theory of Modal Rhythm explicates both the tonal and post-tonal tertian harmonies of western music. The single and double symmetrical systems of their theory represent, in one sense, fundamental structures. Yet no one has explored whether these systems can be compared to Schenkerian <i>Ursätze </i>in the sense of their overarching structural significance in a piece.</p>
<p>In February 2013, at the Glinka Museum in Moscow, Russia, I found a breathtaking eight-page analysis of Chopin’s Op. 28 Prelude, no. 6, by Protopopov, dated March 2, 1945. It demonstrates a Yavorskian analysis of the prelude, with the single and double symmetrical systems working in tandem as a fundamental structure. I intend to show how this analysis constitutes a striking alternative to Schenker’s theories.</p>
<p>The combination of two of more single or double systems constitutes a mode; with a centric pitch, it is a “modal tonality” (<i>ladotonal’snot’</i>). The main modal tonality for Chopin’s Prelude is B-minor. One must suspend normal Schenkerian beliefs to understand Yavorskian procedures and how they relate to tonality. So, for instance, the F#-major modal tonality in mm. 6–8 of the prelude is not understood as a half cadence in B minor; rather, it is an F#-major modal-tonal sphere of influence. That is, it governs the modal gravitations in those measures. I will show how this particular modal-tonal analysis can offer a new version of structural layers in the analysis of tonal music, thus expanding our understanding of tonal procedures.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Shostakovich’s Dominants</p>
<p class="abs-author">Simon Prosser (CUNY Graduate Center)</p>

<p>Many of Shostakovich’s dominants are unusual in their structure and use of chromaticism, often containing lowered scale degrees like flat-2 and flat-4. Such lowered degrees are characteristic of many of the “altered diatonic modes” that Russian theorists (such as Dolzhansky, Mazel’, Adam, and Burda) have identified in Shostakovich’s music; these modes include unusual lowered degrees like flat-2, flat-4, flat-5, and even flat-1 and double-flat-7. Following these Russian modal theorists’ view that Shostakovich’s modes are derived from diatonic ones, I represent them as various stretchings “southward” (i.e., flatting) of the basic major-minor diatonic system on an unconformed <i>Tonnetz</i>. Doing so maps the harmonic-functional potential of these lowered degrees. I then show how they can be combined together and incorporated into a variety of unusual dominant-function sonorities that are characteristic of Shostakovich’s music. Drawing passages from symphonic and chamber works written at all stages of his life, I analyze Shostakovich’s use of these dominant-function sonorities in the context of the altered diatonic modality of these passages. This will open the door to a broader systematic consideration of harmonic function in Shostakovich’s music and its relationship to altered diatonic modality, heretofore not pursued in the literature on Shostakovich’s music. It will also show how ideas from Russian modal theory can be productively synthesized with Anglo-American theories of harmonic function.</p>
