<p>Much contemporary music theory seems predicated on the assumption, usually
tacit, that a proper mathematical description of some musical phenomenon
amounts to an explanation of the effect of that phenomenon on the mind. This
sanguine view of the explanatory power of mathematics in music theory is also
a hallmark of the philosophical approach generally known as “Pythagoreanism,”
which flourished from the fifth century BC to the seventeenth century. The
currency now of such ideas—for example, that purely mathematical relations,
when modelled by pitch relations, account for certain qualia in our
perceptions of those pitch relations—may be regarded as a renewal of faith in
the most emblematic tenet of that ancient school of thought. This panel brings
together papers investigating three cases in which, similarly, theorists of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries exploit, and thereby revive, selected
Pythagorean ideas. Perhaps the most significant of the common threads that
link the panel’s three papers is their implication that such appeals to a more
archaic mode of thought may have arisen in response to dilemmas occasioned by
intellectual developments that were themselves boldly innovative. The papers
on this panel thus argue cogently for the importance of Pythagorean thought as
a latent but readily available option, even when newer epistemic regimes and
their associated methodologies had largely superseded it. They suggest that
even the most forward-looking work in a discipline such as music theory may at
times unwittingly reproduce submerged frameworks and atavistic conceptions
that the field has seemingly left far behind.</p>
