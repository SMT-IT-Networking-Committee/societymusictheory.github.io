<p class="abs-title">Verse-Chorus Forms as Harmonic Patterns</p>
<p class="abs-author">Drew Nobile (University of Oregon)</p>

<p>Theorists who write about rock music generally consider “verse–chorus” to be one single form type. An implication of this view is that all chorus sections are somehow alike—that there is some abstract “chorus-ness” they all share. However, adding a consideration of harmonic aspects reveals that there is significant variation among verse–chorus forms, in particular among their chorus sections. In this paper, I identify three types of “verse–chorus” form, differentiated based on their harmonic patterns: sectional verse¬–chorus, continuous verse–chorus, and verse–prechorus–chorus. The chorus section has an entirely different structure in each of these three forms. In sectional verse–chorus songs, the chorus is a stand-alone section, and often acts as a summarizing anthem while the verses give detail or tell a story. In continuous verse–chorus songs, the chorus begins unstably with a pre-dominant harmony, representing the continuation and conclusion of a tonic-prolonging verse. If choruses in sectional verse–chorus songs encourage us to clap our hands and sing along, choruses in continuous verse–chorus songs encourage us to furrow our brow and listen closely. And in verse–prechorus–chorus songs, the harmonic goal arrives at the <i>beginning</i> of the chorus such that the chorus itself plateaus in celebration of the goal rather than leading toward a goal of its own. These choruses encourage listeners not to sing along or listen closely, but to dance.</p>

<p>This paper presents an empirical model of harmonic function in pop/rock music. Using machine-learning techniques to analyze a corpus of songs from the <i>Billboard</i> ”Hot 100,” we construct a hidden Markov model with four states that can be interpreted as harmonic functions. The model is characterized by several novel features. First, it does not rely on a traditional three-function foundation: while much scholarship has attempted to adapt pop music’s idiomatic practices to traditional functional models, our data- driven approach has no such predispositions, deriving a model solely from the properties of the corpus. We will argue that this model is particularly attractive due to its applicability to analysis, paying focusing on Meat Loaf’s 1977 “Paradise by the Dashboard Light.” We will end with a discussion of several benefits of this model, particularly its sensitivity to changes between different repertories and its ability to mitigate the center/periphery dynamics that come with importing Western-European common-practice expectations onto popular music.</p>
