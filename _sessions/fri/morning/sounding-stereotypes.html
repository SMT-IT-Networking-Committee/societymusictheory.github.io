<p class="abs-title">“They are not Alfredo and Violetta”: Cultural Hierarchy, Race, and Politics in the Cold War Italian Performances of <em>Porgy and Bess</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Siel Agugliaro (University of Pennsylvania)</p>

<p>First performed in New York in 1935, George and Ira Gershwin’s opera <em>Porgy and Bess</em> was based on <em>Porgy</em>, a highly successful novel published a decade before by DuBose Heyward that aimed to give an authentic and sympathetic depiction of black American life in the Southern Unites States. Despite having been critiqued for reinforcing racial stereotypes that catered to a predominantly white audience, the opera offered its all-black cast job opportunities and the prospect of upward social mobility in the context of an often segregated country. Precisely this aspect would later be crucial for the success of the opera in the Cold War era, when the U.S. State Department funded a world tour of <em>Porgy and Bess</em> in an effort to present the United States as a land of equal rights and opportunities for all of its citizens.</p>
<p>Based on archival resources and newspaper accounts from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as on the literature recently published on this subject by historians and music scholars (Noonan, Allen, Crist, and von Eschen, among others), my paper focuses on the Venetian and Milanese performances of the 1952–56 world tour of <em>Porgy and Bess</em>. The scope of my work is twofold. On the one hand, I intend to assess the efficacy of the opera as a vessel of U.S. propaganda in the Italian context. On the other, I will examine the way local critics and audiences received the racial implications of <em>Porgy and Bess</em>, one of the first American operas ever performed in the country, against the backdrop of the prestigious history of the genre: a supposedly cosmopolitan, high culture product born in Italy, which found in venues such as the ones considered in this paper—the Teatro la Fenice in Venice and the Teatro alla Scala in Milan—some of its most prestigious temples.</p>

<p class="abs-title">MacDowell’s Vanishing Indians</p>
<p class="abs-author">Dan Blim (Denison University)</p>

<p>Like many US composers at the turn of the century, Edward MacDowell borrowed Native American melodies. His Second Orchestral Suite (nicknamed “Indian”), has been widely studied; Richard Crawford, Tara Browner, and Kara Gardner have highlighted its tension between Euro- and Native American musics. However, MacDowell’s other Indianist works—two piano miniatures, “Indian Idyll” and “From and Indian Lodge”—have garnered little scholarly attention. This paper analyzes these two works and argues that they forego the tensions and epic battle of the “Indian” Suite, displaying instead an intimate nostalgia. Adopting the construct of what historian Shari Huhndorf theorizes as the “vanishing Indian,” MacDowell’s Indian subjects are thus not actively killed but passively remembered.</p>
<p>In both piano pieces, MacDowell adopts a ternary form, effectively framing their borrowed Native American melodies within the central section. Moreover, MacDowell does so in ways that preserve distance, yet indulge theatrical fantasies. “Indian Idyll” uses harmonic modulation, pedal effects, and metrical ambiguity in the B section to conjure a hazy dream world, then at its conclusion, directs the performer to end “with pathos” and “gradually dying out.” The bookending A sections use the romantic language of a parlor song to heighten the nostalgic effect. “From an Indian Lodge” surrounds the quoted melody with somber tremolos and dynamic contrast in order to position the quotation as a fictional—and finite—tableau. Such gestures resonate with the titular invocation of the popular act of “playing Indian” among Fraternal Orders. In both works, the borrowed Native American melodies are subtly Westernized through phrase structure and harmony, helping the listener safely identify with this exotic fantasy. By thus “taming” his Native American musical subjects, MacDowell’s musical nationalism echoes Walter Benn Michaels’s reading of contemporaneous literary nationalism, suggesting that MacDowell thus participated in a broader cultural movement to rewrite America’s past to contain the racial tensions of the present.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Musical Stereotyping American Jewry in Early Twentieth-Century Mass Media</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel Goldmark (Case Western Reserve University)</p>

<p>This paper explores how the music associated with turn of the century American Jewry was cultivated and shaped largely by the evolving mass-media/ entertainment industry—vaudeville, Tin Pan Alley, theatre, Broadway—and crystallized in early cinema. For a range of reasons, the various entertainment industries developed a more or less unified sound of the music of Jews portrayed via popular music, mainstream cinema, and (as a result) the larger mass culture in America, transforming music that had had historical links with Jewish themes into little more than cultural stereotypes.</p>
<p>Devices of mass culture that seem to have no origin—such as musical tropes— often have their histories effaced, whether intentionally or simply through ignorance; in this case study, the trope began as the melody of the popular song “Choson Kale Mazl Tov,” from Sigmund Mogulesko’s 1894 Yiddish opera <em>Blihmele</em>. By tracing its use as a musical punchline in numerous Tin Pan Alley songs, we see how this song quickly lost its attribution and became a “traditional Yiddish tune.” I show how the musical profiling of ethnic groups that was practiced on stage was perfected among music publishers, who provided Vaudeville, Broadway, and most importantly Hollywood with a ready-made arsenal of musical codes for when the frequent occasion arose for a “Jewish scene” or “Hebrew situation.” By the time the sound film era began in Hollywood—ushered in by the most famous Jewish assimilation film ever, <em>The Jazz Singer</em> (1927)—the sound of American Jewry had not only become cliché, it was a stereotype. Drawing on scholarship on music’s role in immigrant communities trying to assimilate in America (including</p>
<p>W. Williams and Moon) and the transformation of ethnic music into stereotype (Pisani, Garrett, Magee, and Slobin), this paper shows how the mass production and consumption of popular songs and film music that was meant to provide an easy aural analogue for an ethnic group eventually served to codify the sound of a culture into an essence.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“I will meet you when the sun goes down”: From Place to Race in Delius’s <em>Appalachia</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel Grimley (University of Oxford)</p>

<p>In a foreword commissioned for the 1928 German translation of James W. Johnson’s lightly fictionalized novel, <em>An Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</em>, Frederick Delius wrote a nostalgic reminiscence of his days managing a citrus plantation in Jacksonville, Florida. “When in the evening twilight I would sit out on my verandah,” he recalled, “the sound of the singing of the Negroes would reach me from the distance. It seemed wonderful amid such glorious nature.” The formative impact of African American music on Delius’s work has been widely acknowledged in his critical reception, and intensive efforts have been made (most recently by Vic Hobson) to identify the precise origin and nature of its influence. Such accounts, however, have frequently failed to address the question of musical influence through a sufficiently post-colonial lens. The issue of representation raised by Delius’s American works, from his <em>Florida Suite</em> (1887), to his opera <em>Koanga</em> (1897) and, pre-eminently, the “Variations on a old slave song,” <em>Appalachia</em> (1902), demands a response that acknowledges the inescapably political status of such narratives of identity and appropriation.</p>
<p>This paper builds on extensive primary research, both in Florida and in the Delius archives in London, to argue that there is no single source for Delius’s “American style,” and that the ambivalent sense of place evoked by works such as <em>Appalachia</em> is irrevocably bound to notions of race and domination. In the preface to the first edition of the published score, Delius wrote that <em>Appalachia</em> “mirrors the moods of tropical nature in the great swamps bordering on the Mississippi River, which is so intimately associated with the life of the old negro slave population.” Tracing the development of such problematic representations of place and race in <em>Appalachia</em> means not only asking more searching questions about the status of African American influence in Delius’s work, as Naomi André, Karen M. Bryan, and Eric Saylor have persuasively done, but also, to paraphrase the title of Bonnie Gordon’s brilliantly revisionary study, to begin to account for “what Delius didn’t hear.”</p>
