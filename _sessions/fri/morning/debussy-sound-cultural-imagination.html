<p>To commemorate the 2018 centenary of Debussy’s death, this session focuses
on one of the most influential features of the composer’s music—its sound.
Despite the fact that many scholars have noted its importance, Debussy’s sound
has so far resisted in-depth examination. Part of the delay in undertaking
this type of investigation may be attributed to the equation of Debussy’s
music with contemporaneous visual techniques. While this tendency has
dominated critical discourse over the last century, the subjugation of sound
to image has proved detrimental for understanding the nuanced ways in which
Debussy conceived of sound in his writings and articulated its presence in his
compositions. Equally significant are the difficulties encountered in
critically engaging with the material and multiple qualities of musical sound,
an area of research that not only encompasses the particulars of acoustics,
harmony, instrumental timbre and texture, but also sound’s status as a marker
of individual style, as a historically situated object of sensation, and as a
technologically mediated phenomenon. In this regard, recent scholarship in
sound studies and spectral analysis proves useful for encouraging new ways of
thinking about Debussy’s approach to sonic expression.</p>

<p>Three fifty-minute panels, each comprising three position papers, a
response, and questions from the audience will address different facets of
Debussy’s sound, from how it was understood by contemporaneous critics and
composers, to how it was adopted and adapted by successive generations of
musicians across a range of media. The first panel offers various perspectives
on the reception of Debussy’s sound during the composer’s lifetime; the second
panel considers the continued influence of Debussy’s sound in the concert
music of later generations of composers, both within and beyond France; and
the third panel extends the examination of Debussy’s sound to examples drawn
from film, radio, and video games. The centerpiece of this special session is
a fifteen-minute piano recital featuring two works related by their
indebtedness to predecessors’ experiments with sound: Messiaen’s
<i>Préludes</i>, the sixth of which, “Cloches d’angoisse et larmes d’adieu”
(Bells of Anguish and Tears of Farewell), pays homage to Debussy’s
<i>Préludes</i>; and Tristan Murail’s <i>Cloches d’adieu, et un sourire
</i>(Bells of Farewell, and a Smile), which pays tribute to Messiaen, and his
sixth prelude in particular.</p>

<p>Throughout, this special session aims to open avenues for further research
in this under-explored and elusive area of the composer’s music and, more
broadly, to speculate on the reasons why the sound world associated with
Debussy continues to resonate in the cultural imagination of musicians
today.</p>
