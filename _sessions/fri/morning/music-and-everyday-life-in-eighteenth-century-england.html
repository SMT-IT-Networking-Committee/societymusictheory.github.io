<p class="abs-title">Dealing with Capitalism: Card Decks and the Circulation of Portable Music in Georgian England</p>
<p class="abs-author">Bethany Cencer (SUNY Potsdam)</p>

<p>English printers during the eighteenth century published a variety of miniature books—almanacs, travel guides, local histories, and the like. These texts, usually styled as “pocket companions,” were designed in part for ease of transport. Music was also frequently printed in miniature, portable forms as psalters, songsters, and scores. While musicologists have more recently investigated mobile music, they have focused primarily on contemporary digital media. Yet the popularity of portable music in eighteenth-century England provokes examination of the economics and geographies of urban musical life beyond the salon and concert stage. Drawing on primary sources from the British, Bodleian, Huntington, and Lewis Walpole Libraries, this paper uses portable music to better understand the composition, commodification, and circulation of music in Georgian England. I focus on a particularly curious publication format to illustrate my observations: card decks. Editor George Smart published <em>The Vocal Pocket Companion</em> (ca. 1785), which contains catches, glees, and canons for two and three voices engraved on fifty-two playing cards. The cards are dedicated to political hostess Frances Crewe, and feature seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English composers such as Purcell, Hilton, Arne, and Greene. In 1789, Smart issued a similarly titled set for two, three, and four voices. Dedicated to Lady Yonge, this sequel includes entirely contemporaneous repertoire by composers including Cooke, Danby, Webbe, and Callcott.</p>
<p>I argue that these cards illuminate three central contours of English musical life. First, their portability and references to female social elites attest to the intermingling of song and pleasure in England. Smart’s decks could be used anywhere that cards were played, including salons, billiard halls, and public houses. Second, the printing of antiquarian and contemporary glees on objects designated for social entertainment suggests that both composition and historical study were treated as gentlemanly leisure pastimes, affirming the prominence of associational culture in the production and preservation of English music. Last, in combining two familiar publication formats to elicit a potential new niche market, Smart’s musical playing cards exemplify the impetus of early capitalism to identify new ways of commodifying music for a burgeoning middle- and upper-class consumer base.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The <em>Myrtle of Venus</em> and <em>Bacchus’s Vine</em> at London’s Anacreontic Society</p>
<p class="abs-author">Katelyn Clark (University of Toronto)</p>

<p>London’s Anacreontic Society was a gentlemen’s musical club, a venue for refined sociability that served as a key point of entry into the city’s professional music world from 1766 to 1792, including Haydn’s notable visit in 1791. The final decade of the Anacreontic meetings provides as exceptional setting for examining the developing concept of sociability between the sexes during the late Enlightenment, encapsulating the involvement of women in music performance circumstances and the complex issues of masculinity in London’s professional artistic world. The contentious admittance of women to the concert portion of the Society’s meetings in 1787 demonstrated the shifting public role of women in musical activity, confirmed by the presence of amateur musician Lady Georgina Cavendish at the Crown and Anchor Tavern concert room during the Anacreontic events. As McVeigh notes (2012), the presence of women at the Society’s meetings created a rare example of female gaze, the unwelcome audience members consequently compared to “a seraglio of Turkish beauties” in <em>The Times</em> (1791).</p>
<p>This paper examines the impact of women as audience members at the Society events, focusing on a controversial and progressive masculinity that supported female involvement in Anacreontic activities, and the reactionary ideas that opposed a social mix of “the Myrtle of Venus” with “Bacchus’s Vine.” Contributing to current research on the Anacreontic Society (Achilleos 2008; Salwey 2004) and eighteenth-century gender and sexuality (Head 2013; Berry 2013), this paper argues that the development of an educated and elite masculinity provided an extraordinary opportunity for English women to participate in public artistic and political events through concert meetings and social alliances at the Anacreontic Society events. Drawing from contemporary images and press sources, the impact of public attacks on Anacreontic activities and critiques of the Society’s conservative expression of masculinity will be considered as leading factors to the Anacreontic Society’s dissolution in 1792.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“For the Benefit Of . . .”: Italian Opera and the Establishment of the Singer’s Benefit in Early Eighteenth-Century Britain</p>
<p class="abs-author">Alison DeSimone (University of Missouri-Kansas City)</p>

<p>In the first decade of the eighteenth century, professional singers from Italy began performing on London’s stages. While the ultimate ambition of any foreign musician in England was to achieve financial and artistic success, a more immediate goal would have been to establish themselves within an existing network of musicians, composers, and patrons in their new city. Benefit performances, especially, became key opportunities for professional singers to build their reputations, because the beneficiary often had near complete control over programming, marketing, and organizing the event—all of which impacted the financial success of the evening, as well as audience reception. Programs, some of which are preserved in advertisements and primary accounts from the period, were carefully designed to highlight the evening’s featured performer. Thus, reconstructions of benefit operas and concerts illustrate the deliberate performance choices that professional singers made in their self-fashioning as stars.</p>
<p>This paper considers how professional singers, both Italian and English, used the benefits to establish their reputations between 1714 and 1729—years that were both crucial to the establishment of Italian opera in England, and that include some of the earliest musical benefits. My reconstructions of benefits from the period show that singers gave these special performances in order to collaborate within a network of professional musicians; to create and promote their individual celebrity; and to construct and respond to particular narratives about contemporary musical taste.</p>
<p>To illustrate the strategic purposes of benefits, I shall discuss three case studies: a collaborative benefit concert of vocal music given by Margarita de l’Epine in 1714; a benefit performance of Handel’s <em>Ottone</em> in 1723, which featured four new arias for Francesca Cuzzoni; and Ann Turner Robinson’s benefit concert from 1729, which featured Handel’s music almost exclusively in a year when Italian opera was absent from the London stage. What emerges is a complex portrait of the negotiations that singers made between their onstage personas, their professional relationships with other musicians, and the musical tastes of their English audiences—all of which encouraged the promotion of Italian opera in early eighteenth-century England.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Traveling Music and Theatrics: Jemmy LaRoche and John Eccles’ “Raree Show”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sarah F. Williams (University of South Carolina)</p>

<p>Popular from the seventeenth through the nineteenth century in England, traveling peep shows, or “rare shows,” were portable boxes containing a miniature scene usually presented in public gathering spaces. The viewer would peer through a “peephole,” much like a camera obscura, to witness a small tableau while the showman provided a musical entertainment. Many of the purveyors of these traveling “multi-media” experiences at the time were Savoyards, hence the more prominent “raree show” spelling intended to approximate the French accent. Toward the end of the century, Jemmy LaRoche, a professional singer/actor on London’s “legitimate” stage, became well known for his song “Raree Show” from Peter Motteux’s <em>Europe’s revels for the peace of Ryswick</em> (1698) with music by John Eccles. While the political implications of <em>Europe’s revels</em> and its music have been examined, the mechanisms through which LaRoche and Eccles’ music achieved far-reaching cultural impact beyond the court and theater-going audiences for this English <em>ballet des nations</em> have attracted little notice. References to LaRoche’s song and performances “traveled”—much like he did with his portable miniature stage—across genres, social classes, time, and performance venues. Shakespearean scholar Jonathan Gil Harris notes that understanding matter only in the form of the object “ignores the dynamic dimensions” of that object. LaRoche’s traveling box was more than a static object; it was a performative space where the boundaries of venue, time, and genre began to dissolve. References to “Raree Show” and its refrain appear around the turn of the eighteenth century in broadside ballads, mezzotint prints, and political tracts. Harris’ work and his applications of the Aristotelean theory of <em>dynameos</em>, or matter as potentiality, are useful for musicologists who consider not only object theory but also itinerant performance and popular musics. In this particular case, these ideas help elucidate the complex network of intertextual, social, and musical relationships that the “Raree Show” melody and its performative venue created for listeners and viewers. In a larger sense, the persistence and constant evolution of the music for “Raree Show” demonstrates that suspicion against foreigners continued well after the “Peace” of Ryswick.</p>
