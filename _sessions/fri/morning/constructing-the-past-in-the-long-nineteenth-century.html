<p class="abs-title">Dr. Burney’s Complaint and the Case of Mendelssohn’s Great Passion</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ellen Exner (New England Conservatory of Music)</p>

<p>Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy’s famous Berlin performance of J. S. Bach’s <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> in 1829 has been described as miraculous and groundbreaking. It is widely considered the kindling spark behind the Bach Revival, a defining moment in western music’s history. What is often left out of popular mythology, though, is that Mendelssohn’s choice of repertory was not revolutionary in context. This paper will demonstrate that it was instead consistent with nearly a century of local tradition in Berlin that began during the reign of Frederick II (1740–86). The musical activities of three generations of the Mendelssohn family, particularly the women, demonstrate deep appreciation for music of the Bach family already in the mid-eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Celia Applegate productively explored important aspects of the Bach Revival in her book <em>Bach in Berlin</em> (2005). Her study, though, relied upon an outdated music-historical narrative that has since been superseded by research on both sides of the Atlantic. Fifteen years of scholarly engagement with the formerly lost music library of the Berlin Sing-Akademie (the civic institution with which Mendelssohn performed Bach’s Passion) has begun to bear fruit. As a result, our received view of the city’s musical past is undergoing significant reorientation under the weight of new discoveries.</p>
<p>The musical culture of Frederick’s Berlin was peculiar for its time: it featured intentional reuse of works that were, even then, decades old. In the 1770s, traveling Englishman Charles Burney mocked Berlin’s apparent stylistic backwardness in his published accounts, not realizing that what he had experienced was actually the formation of a local canon, a “Berliner Klassik,” as it is now being called among German scholars. Mendelssohn grew up in Berlin, steeped in the idea that music of the past had a natural place alongside music of the present. Because the city had also been home to more of J. S. Bach’s students than any other, their works were an integral part of this burgeoning tradition from its outset. Paradoxically, what Burney diagnosed as a failure to progress ultimately developed into one of the most vital elements of modern musical culture.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Hans von Bülow’s Gospel of Beethoven</p>
<p class="abs-author">Karen Leistra-Jones (Franklin &amp; Marshall College)</p>

<p>Hans von Bülow’s statements on music often employed pointedly religious rhetoric: “I believe in Bach the Father, Beethoven the Son, and in Brahms the Holy Ghost of music,” he proclaimed. Elsewhere, he termed Beethoven’s sonatas the “New Testament” of piano music. Beginning in the 1870s, these types of pronouncements became an important aspect of Bülow’s public image, as he reinvented himself as a Beethoven specialist with his celebrated edition of Beethoven’s piano sonatas (1871) and his practice of performing “cycles” of Beethoven’s works. Critical responses to Bülow as a pianist and as a conductor began to mirror his religious rhetoric, describing his concerts as a kind of preaching, a proclamation of the Beethoven “gospel,” or a scriptural exegesis, and likening his audiences to devout congregations.</p>
<p>Such accounts participated in the well-documented elevation of instrumental music to the status of <em>Kunstreligion</em> during the nineteenth century. Yet they moved beyond this tradition’s often-noted roots in Pietism and mystical spirituality. Drawing on an extensive archive of reviews at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, this paper demonstrates that Bülow and his critics presented his artistic offerings in the context of a more traditional Protestant religiosity. They eschewed the solitary ecstasies of early Romantic writers, and they avoided calling the performer a “priest,” an epithet common in mid-century music criticism. Instead, they emphasized the scriptural role of Beethoven’s works and highlighted the pastoral aspects of Bülow’s performances: his focus on a strict “gospel” of canonic texts, the affinity of his playing with preaching and biblical interpretation, and the thoughtful engagement of his listeners.</p>
<p>These developments derived not only from a changing relationship to the musical past. They also aligned with attempts to create a national culture in the <em>Kaiserreich</em> of the 1870s and 1880s, which included numerous calls for new forms of spiritual experience free from the dogmas of organized religion, yet consistent with the Protestantism that was increasingly touted as a unifying force. In this context, Bülow was able to invest the role of the performer with a prestige that drew on the interpretive practices and modes of authority associated with the Protestant church.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Replacing Haydn: Luigi Cherubini’s “affair Esterházy,” 1810–11</p>
<p class="abs-author">Fabio Morabito (King’s College London)</p>

<p>Until today, Cherubini’s aspirations to become Joseph Haydn’s successor at the Esterházy Court have remained largely undiscussed. It was only in 2014 that Cherubini’s heirs disclosed for the first time a group of letters concerning the negotiations between the Parisian composer and Prince Nikolaus II, Haydn’s last patron. The plan to hire Cherubini as his Kapellmeister was almost certainly linked to the Prince’s dissatisfaction with acting-Kapellmeister Hummel, who had been dismissed a first time in 1808 and then permanently in spring 1811, precisely when Cherubini was supposed to start his duties. The deal, however, could not be concluded: the financial crisis and high inflation prompted by the Napoleonic wars would eventually lead to Haydn’s post remaining vacant. Cherubini was profoundly affected by this rebuff. His archive shows that in the following decades the composer (and his relatives after his death) repeatedly sought from the Esterházy a compensation for financial losses and the damage to Cherubini’s reputation.</p>
<p>In this paper, I re-examine the “affair Esterházy” against Cherubini’s efforts between 1805 and 1811 to craft his musical identity as inextricably linked to Haydn: from showcasing a profound engagement with his music in a memorial cantata “on Haydn’s death”; to replacing three pages from the complete autograph of Symphony no. 103 with pages in his own hand. Haydn’s manuscript still contains Cherubini’s substituted sheets, which show a visible, even obsessive effort to reproduce distinguishing features of Haydn’s handwriting. By linking together such hitherto unexplored traces, I consider Cherubini’s attempts to associate himself with Haydn as performing for the public a virtual handover between “the patriarch of music” and him.</p>
<p>As Matthew Head and Mark Evan Bonds have shown, the contemporary discourse around Haydn’s death did not just call for an immediate replacement of his duties at court, but was perceived as a matter concerning the future of music at large. Building on this discourse, my paper is concerned above all with Cherubini’s desire to write his own history in Haydn’s footsteps as a timeless master; for what it reveals about the construction of musical identity and the composer’s image in a fledgling, pan-European market.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Burying Brahms: Vienna’s <em>Ehrengräber</em> for Composers and the Fashioning of a City’s Self-Image</p>
<p class="abs-author">Reuben Phillips (Princeton University)</p>

<p>A mecca for music lovers, Group 32A of Vienna’s Central Cemetery serves as a final resting place for some of the city’s most distinguished musicians. But the creation of this grove in which musical luminaries slumber together in eternal harmony necessitated the exhumation of decaying corpses. Vienna’s <em>Ehrengräber</em> were established in the late nineteenth century, postdating the original burials of the city’s most famous composers.</p>
<p>What were the agendas that governed the creation of the <em>Ehrengräber</em>, and how did the new graves articulate Vienna’s changing sense of its musical past? Following recent studies of music and monumentality (Rehding 2009), I explore these issues through a critical investigation of the <em>Ehrengräber</em> from the 1880s up until the burial of Johannes Brahms.</p>
<p>My paper begins by homing in on the public rituals that accompanied the re-burials of Beethoven and Schubert. Taking place in June and September 1888, these ceremonial events occasioned solemn processions, crowds of mourners, and an abundance of floral tributes. Such spectacles upgraded the civic status of Vienna’s star composers, while also allowing current residents and cultural institutions to honor the icons of the city’s past. The resulting graves, along with those added in the next decade, functioned collectively as a material representation of Vienna’s new self-image as a “<em>Musikstadt</em>” (Nußbaumer 2008).</p>
<p>In this context, the death of Brahms in April 1897 proved to be a significant event, his interment in Group 32A performing a double act of legitimation. The placement of Brahms’s grave in close proximity to his composer forebears affirmed his important role within Viennese musical life; at the same time, the burial set another jewel in the <em>Ehrengräber</em> crown, helping to justify earlier exhumations. Brahms’s burial connects to concerns about Germanic identity evident in the Viennese musical press (Brodbeck 2014), but it also serves as a good point of departure for thinking about the values that would dominate the historiography of the composer in the years that followed.</p>
