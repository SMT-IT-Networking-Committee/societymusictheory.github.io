<p class="abs-title">“She Needs Me”: Marvin Gaye, Crooning, and Vocal Agency at Motown</p>
<p class="abs-author">Andrew Flory (Carleton College)</p>

<p>Marvin Gaye wanted to be a balladeer. Between 1961 and 1965, he released four albums of standards and split his performances between chitlin’ circuit theaters and middle-class supper clubs. Although Gaye stopped releasing middle-of-the-road material after the mid-1960s, he continued to work on ballads for the next two decades in the private realm of the recording studio, focusing mostly on a set of standards arranged and recorded by Bobby Scott in 1966. Gaye recorded dozens of new performances over these tracks, using his voice to recast and recompose the songs’ melodies and lyrics in numerous ways. Using unreleased recordings from the Motown archives, this paper follows the history of Gaye’s work with one of these songs, Arthur Hamilton’s “She Needs Me,” over a thirteen-year gestation, from its first recording session in 1966 to Gaye’s final work on the track in 1979. Extending Mark Burford’s work on Sam Cooke as “album artist” in the late 1950s and Keir Keightley’s writings about the “middlebrow” shift in the pop market during the mid-1960s, I discuss Gaye’s method of “vocal composition” through two critical lenses: first, as a form of agency over the creative process at Motown after the decline of MOR pop; second, as evidence of technological empowerment, which allowed Gaye to use improvisation, re-composition, and amalgamation to develop a forward-looking style of vocal-oriented writing and arranging that would come to fruition in R&amp;B during the 1980s and 1990s. In the end, I focus on the manner in which Gaye’s approach to “She Needs Me” changed between 1966 and 1979. During the mid-’60s, as a black man assuming a middle-class identity for public consumption, Gaye was situated between a world of crooning occupied by African Americans like Cooke and Nat “King” Cole, and gospel-oriented vocalists like Ronald Isley and Solomon Burke. He moved freely between lush pop appropriate for adult-oriented supper clubs and gospel-oriented gutbucket soul. “She Needs Me” provides an example of how these worlds had merged during by the 1970s, a time when the vocal arrangements and performance style of Gaye’s standards became remarkably similar to his approach to R&amp;B-oriented soul.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Mahalia Jackson’s Class Politics of Voice</p>
<p class="abs-author">Mark Burford (Reed College)</p>

<p>Crosscutting the career, reception, and self-identity of gospel singer Mahalia Jackson are a cluster of questions about her voice, inflected by issues of race, place, and class. Jackson, citing a wide range of sacred and secular vocal models on the street, in church, and on recordings, insisted that her singing was deeply rooted in the musical traditions of her native New Orleans. At the same time, she calibrated the social meanings of these influences through comparison of what are conventionally characterized as “vernacular” and “cultivated” vocalities. However much we may recognize these dualistic categories, popularized within American musicology by H. Wiley Hitchcock, as discursively constructed, Jackson herself persistently invoked this distinction. A critical reading of these recurring references makes legible the contours of Jackson’s thinking about the class dynamics of her personal practice of voice.</p>
<p>Jackson confessed a self-perceived lack of vocal training, a “natural” asset praised enthusiastically by many commentators. Yet she maintained an equivocal intrigue with formally trained voices, and one senses a rub of defiant cultural pride and nagging social anxiety in her comments on “vernacular” and “cultivated” singing. If in some contexts Jackson questioned cultural hierarchies privileging trained voices and even provocatively declared herself to be “America’s most primitive singer,” in others she acknowledged her youthful study of recordings by concert vocalists and urged up-and-coming gospel singers to “get a good musical education.” Not simply a matter of black and white, this ambivalence is marked by Jackson’s historical moment. As music came to occupy a unique role in postbellum and early twentieth-century black education initiatives, particularly among mainline congregations, instruction in “voice culture” sought to cultivate a range of techniques identified with concert singing while also embracing the goals of national citizenship, social refinement, and black cultural honor. Spoken remarks and selections from her nationally broadcast radio program illustrate how, as Jackson’s growing fame in the 1950s carried her to new performance settings, she negotiated the class politics of vocal expectation with revealing openness, registering what it meant for a black voice to sound “vernacular” and “cultivated” values within black communities and on the public stage.</p>



<p class="abs-title">The Vocal Politics of NBC’s <em>The Voice</em>: Exposing Cultural Essentialism, Affirming Social Hierarchy</p>
<p class="abs-author">Allison McCracken (DePaul University)</p>

<p>This paper focuses on the way in which the very popular American television vocal singing competition program, <em>The Voice</em> (NBC, 2011–present) both exposes the essentializing discourses regarding race and gender that have shaped American vocal culture for decades and simultaneously perpetuates social hierarchies of race and sex. Although voices have been subject to the same kinds of social construction as bodies, they have received much less scholarly attention. It is still quite common to associate certain kinds of vocal aesthetics and delivery styles with specific raced or gendered bodies. Industrial practices have reinforced these distinctions for so long that they have become naturalized. This was not always the case. As musicologists have argued, a “musical color line” was developed in the 1920s that largely erased public memory of the performance world that existed before it, one in which popular voices, unlike bodies, were not raced or gendered. But commercial imperatives and cultural hierarchies led to the development of essentialist vocal codes as part of a more rigidly raced and gendered popular culture, codes that have largely persisted.</p>
<p><em>The Voice</em> continually reveals the fallacy of these codes; indeed, the program’s success has depended on it. <em>The Voice</em>’s “hook” is its blind auditions; the four industry judges must decide a singer’s promise through voice alone. Because it makes room for older, less conventionally attractive, “packaged” performers, <em>The Voice</em> has positioned itself as representative of America’s “true” social diversity. Initially, however, these auditions relied on shock value, the fact that auditioners’ voices often belied the judges’ expectations of a singer’s race and sex (“How are you not black?” “You’re not a girl!”). But over time such “freak” contestants have become increasingly naturalized. As a result, <em>The Voice</em> has indeed revealed the kind of vocal diversity rarely acknowledged on a national media platform, substantially undermining American music culture’s vocal essentialism. At the same time, however, this denaturalizing has ultimately most benefitted white working-class male contestants who “sound” like people of color; as a result, contestants of color have been increasingly marginalized as each season progresses, thus perpetuating social and industrial hierarchies.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Not Like a Girl: Tina Turner’s Vocal Sound and Rock and Roll Success</p>
<p class="abs-author">Maureen Mahon (New York University)</p>

<p>“I always used to sing along with men singers,” Tina Turner told a reporter in 1972, “so I didn’t really sound like a girl.” Turner’s tone and timbre, her shouts, screams, and high volume, created a rough and raw sound that departed from traditional concepts of a feminine voice. The result was a vocal style rooted in a compelling gender ambiguity that paralleled her visual image. Clad in revealing stage costumes, her body gleaming with perspiration after an onslaught of furious dance motion, she accentuated a forthright sexuality long assumed to be natural to black women and, consequently, unfeminine. As the Queen of “Raunch and Roll,” to use a <em>Rolling Stone</em> writer’s phrase, Tina Turner developed a sonic and visual style that resonated with the late sixties rock scene’s celebration of musical and sexual liberation. In this paper, I discuss how Turner used her distinctive voice and “raunchy” style to wend her way into rock as the star of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue in the late 1960s and to achieve superstar status as a solo artist in the 1980s. Through a discussion of her vocal sound on key recordings from the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, I show that the blockbuster commercial success Turner ultimately achieved with her 1984 album <em>Private Dancer</em> was the result of years of mobilizing her vocal talent and navigating the recording industry’s expectations of blackness, black female difference, and musical genre that had circumscribed so many other black women vocalists.</p>
