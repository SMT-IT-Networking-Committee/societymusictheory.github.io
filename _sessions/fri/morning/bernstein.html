<p class="abs-title">“Radical Chic” and Leonard Bernstein’s Politics of Style</p>
<p class="abs-author">Katherine Baber (University of Redlands)</p>

<p>Bernstein spent his life in music refusing boundaries and labels, whether of genre, profession, or style. The one label that stuck, however, has been the most impenetrable: “radical chic.” When Tom Wolfe coined the term in <em>New York Magazine</em> in 1970 as a critique of a benefit for the legal defense of several members of the Black Panther Party hosted by Felicia Bernstein, he implied that for the Bernsteins’ circle, politics was stylish and nothing more. I suggest that the term “radical chic,” besides being a perennial putdown of openly political artists, is useful when reading the politics of Bernstein’s music. Though he certainly cut a stylish public figure, Bernstein’s choices as to <em>musical</em> style were often political.</p>
<p>Bernstein’s aggressive polystylism constitutes its own topical language, rooted both in broader cultural associations and in his strategic use of such types and styles in his own works over time. Jazz and the blues, for instance, helped</p>
<p>Bernstein mediate issues of race and gender in American culture during and after World War II, as explored in Carol Oja’s study of <em>On the Town</em> and Elizabeth Wells’s of <em>West Side Story</em>. On the other hand, twelve-tone rows and other gestures toward modernist styles often appear as disruptive forces, as in the Symphony no. 3 and <em>Mass</em>. Bernstein also reached for transcendent moments, a clearing out of the stylistic space which typically helped reveal a central message, as in numbers like “Somewhere” (<em>West Side Story</em>) or “Make Our Garden Grow” (<em>Candide</em>). This paper examines the intersection between politics, style, and structure in two case studies, both written after the “radical chic” episode: <em>Mass</em> (1971) and <em>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue</em> (1976). Using a coded politics of style enabled Bernstein to express himself both boldly and subtly in a decade of newly heightened political tensions. The particular form of his engagement speaks to the recurring question among musicologists and music theorists of how music relates to politics and other extra-musical phenomena. The term “radical chic” critiques the presumed superficiality of this relationship, but it is precisely the stylistic interplay at the musical surface that draws us toward deeper structural and interpretive meanings.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Bernstein’s Body</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniel Callahan (Boston College)</p>

<p>Learning that Mahler’s Tenth Symphony had been edited and completed for performance, Leonard Bernstein said, “I have one question. Will it give me an orgasm?” He was not exactly joking, as many who have witnessed his conducting realize.</p>
<p>Scholars have focused mainly on Bernstein’s compositions and, occasionally, his politics. Sustained discussion of his podium performances, however, has been left to fans and critics. The latter often cast opprobrium by describing Bernstein’s bodily movements as “embarrassing,” “flamboyant,” “grotesque,” “hysterical”— as, in short, too sexual. Criticism of Mahler’s conducting often betrayed anti-Semitism; that of Bernstein’s often revealed homophobia, and not just the larger fear of the body endemic to classical music performance. Bernstein long knew that a conductor’s body in musical motion could be a source of both anxiety and fascination. A college sophomore in 1937, Bernstein saw Mitropoulos conduct and immediately fell in love. A year later, Bernstein wrote about his relationship with Mitropoulos, renamed “Eros Mavro,” in an autobiographical story titled “The Occult.” Drawing on that story, unpublished correspondence, oral histories, and reviews across his career, I propose that Bernstein understood, practiced, and capitalized on conducting as a transfer of erotic power and pleasure between a conductor and his musicians and audience.</p>
<p>In this presentation I contend that Bernstein approached conducting as a deliberate choreography and not, as many assume, as spontaneous effusions accompanying a beat and occasional cues. I provide analyses of Bernstein’s movements and affect that remain consistent across different performances of specific moments in the music of Mahler, Chaikovsky, and Beethoven captured on both archival and commercial film. Although I take Bernstein’s multiple annotated scores for and analyses of these works into account, my focus is foremost on Bernstein’s physical empathy with the sound that he desired and (often, if not always successfully) drew from the orchestra. Bernstein’s shameless presentation of his body on the podium was honest, instructive, liberating, and, necessarily, most carefully choreographed.</p>
