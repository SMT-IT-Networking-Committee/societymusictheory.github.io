<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>With its traditional concern for musical form, music theory may provoke debate about how form mediates cultural “content”—a flexible notion of “content” can comprise sexuality, other types of identity, the dissolution of cultural categories themselves, and the very emergence of new conceptions of form. This broad cultural vista lends itself to a far-reaching investigation on the level of mediation and epistemology, where musical form operates and is open to <i>queering</i>.</p>
<p>Some groundbreaking work in queer musicology in the 90s can be seen as addressing the content “in” form, as if form were a chalice for content. This work was broadly narratological in that it commented on gender and sexuality as found “in” musical form, and as such, it arguably supports the conceptual separation of musical form from sexuality. One way to approach the hoary issue of form versus content is to address the notion of form<i> as</i> content, by analyzing how form <i>mediates</i> sexual-cultural content.</p>
<p>Aside from the mediation of sexuality content, the queering of musical form takes place also on the level of rethinking the conceptual frame of what cultural content comprises—the very content which is mediated by form. We are familiar with the import of cultural “difference,” but “difference” can be further parsed through: the cultural complex that cultural differences form, the emergence or production of difference, and the dissolution of difference. Rather than containing this difference, musical form can be understood as being <i>predicated</i> on an epistemology of cultural difference.</p>

<p>Audre Lorde writes of “the erotic—the sensual—those physical, emotional, and psychic expressions of what is deepest and strongest and richest within each of us, being shared.” She writes interpersonally, but such deep, strong, rich engagement informs personal relations with music, too. We analysts obviously take a deep, an erotic, pleasure in the growing intimacy we achieve with our musical “beloved” in the acts of analysis. Crafting the words is another act of deep engagement with the music, though too often our words don’t express intimacy with music or pleasure in it. If brought into the open, how might the erotics of musical engagement enlighten our practice?</p>

<p>How can potentials of identity destabilize or emerge through “counterintuitive” ideas of “failure,” passivity, debility, or acts of unbecoming? In my discussion, I present ideas that both support and critique a politics of identity and bodily experience, thinking about processes that disturb, destabilize, and dissolve identity in difference and differentiation, and those that also serve connectivity. Nadine Hubbs has written about the liberatory and erotic potentials of a “subject-shattering via subject-object merging” that are central to both modern gay and <i>musico</i>sexual practices. Music examples pursue these ideas, as well as those of Judith Peraino on the (queer) attractions of all-consuming passion, and Veit Erlmann on the problems of exclusively resisting or embracing difference (or sameness)—for an “ethics” of vivifying music experience that allows for varying degrees of complicity, oppression, and insight.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Multiplicities: Music Theory and Difference</p>
<p class="abs-author">Judith Lochhead (Stony Brook University)</p>

<p>The value of situational multiplicity extends far beyond music theory, but all significant cultural change begins locally. Within the still young Society for Music Theory, a group of interested people met on the 8th of November in 1985 at the Vancouver meeting in a session titled “Making a Place for Women.” The turnout for that meeting was significant and the people there were genuinely interested in the topic of what a feminist theory of music would entail. Some thirty years later, the productive outcomes of that first meeting are music theoretical contributions from queer, gender, ethnic, and racial perspectives.</p>
<p>My contribution to this panel focuses on how an ontology of musical differing produces music theoretical perspectives that can account for the multiple situations of listeners, scholars, performers, and creators in ways that keep the discipline vital and inclusive. Building on the work of Karen Barad on diffraction and Alain Badiou on multiplicity, I consider how only with the differing music theories from queer, feminist, racial, and ethnic perspectives may we have a full understanding of how music works.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Sexuality and Musical Narrative</p>
<p class="abs-author">Fred Maus (University of Virginia)</p>

<p>When scholars of gender and sexuality have interpreted classical instrumental music, they often rely on concepts of musical narrative. Susan McClary’s account of sonata form in <i>Feminine Endings</i> is a famous example (1991). McClary also relies on narrative ideas in her queer-oriented readings of music by Tchaikovsky and Schubert. Philip Brett’s description of a Schubert movement, in “Piano Four-Hands,” is a distinguished example.</p>
<p>This paper explores the connection between queer sexuality and musical narrative in two ways. First, I propose that the project of seeking narrative messages in instrumental music is idiomatic for queer subjects in an environment of closeted sexuality, because of the way music can combine intimacy and lack of specificity. And second, I suggest that the themes of some classic music-narrative studies, though not explicitly connected to sexuality, are pertinent to queer lives, drawing on work by Edward T. Cone, Anthony Newcomb, and Charles Fisk.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Queer Bifurcation</p>
<p class="abs-author">Gavin Lee (Soochow University, China)</p>

<p>How can developments in music theory be assessed through the concepts of bifurcation, which holds the potential for non-normativity, and unification (Robert Morgan), which promises alignment? Brian Massumi’s gloss on bifurcation as the point of the emergence of new paths serves to elucidate the emergence of new, different music theories. Bifurcatory change gestures to a queer production of non-normativity, while unification has the opposite effect, bringing about alignment that contradicts the vagaries of embodied listening.</p>
