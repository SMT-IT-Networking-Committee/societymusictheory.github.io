<p>How do I know if administration is right for me? When during my career is
the right time to consider an administrative position? How do I balance
teaching, research, and administration? How do I keep a connection to music
and to music theory alive in an administrative position? How do I prepare to
be a successful applicant for an administrative position? What are the skills
necessary to being a successful administrator? What do administrators in
various roles do?</p>

<p>These questions form the focus of this session. Mid-career music theorists
may be interested in administrative positions, as our fieldâ€™s penchant for
analysis and structured thinking predisposes us to the kinds of tasks
administration requires. This session aims to demystify the transition to
administration, and to help scholars make an informed decision about seeking
or accepting an administrative role.</p>

<p>The session will begin with presentations by four theorists whose career
trajectories have taken them into administrative positions, followed by a
discussion period among the panelists that includes questions from the
audience. Our goal is that attendees will leave the session with a clearer
idea of how they might navigate career opportunities in administration, as
well as the joys and challenges those opportunities represent.</p>
