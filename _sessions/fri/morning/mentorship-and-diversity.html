<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<P>This session will focus on the role that mentorship plays in the lives and
career successes of racially and ethnically diverse students and scholars. The
session will have two parts. Part I will feature a roundtable discussion in
which a group of participants of diverse backgrounds and experiences react to
and discuss readings about the topic of mentorship. In Part II, we will discuss
the pipeline that one travels from high school through undergraduate education,
graduate school, landing a job, and finally, getting tenure. Mentors and mentees
who represent each stage of this process will reflect on the particulars of
their situations, as well as offer more general advice. We hope the session will
allow us to reflect on the challenges that lie before us in our efforts to be
good mentors and to consider what strategies we might employ to improve the
diversity of the Society.</P>
