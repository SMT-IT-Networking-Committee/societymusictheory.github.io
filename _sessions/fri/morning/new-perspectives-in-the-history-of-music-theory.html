<p class="abs-title">Rameau, the Subjective Body, and the Forms of Theoretical Representation</p>
<p class="abs-author">Maryam A. Moshaver (University of Alberta)</p>

<p>In the early 1750s, Jean-Philippe Rameau’s music-theoretical writings drew the attention of the Editors of the <em>Encyclopédie</em> to a potential of music to epitomize an epistemological link between the materiality of sound in theoretical representation, and the subjective realms of sensory perception and affective response (Cernuschi, 2000). As early as the <em>Génération harmonique</em> (1737), Rameau presented, parallel to acoustics and physiology, a psychological description of the dynamic effort of the ear as it adjusts and tempers itself to the subterranean movement of the fundamental bass. It accomplishes this feat through an effort of retention of the principal sound of the key (the “generator of the mode”), the sensory first of the sounding object, that sets in motion the harmonic itineraries to which the ear adjusts itself “without thinking, and in an occult manner.”</p>
<p>It is only in the early nineteenth century that a perspective on this role of the subjective body in the knowledge we have of the world—which Rameau described without being able to defend—emerges through Maine de Biran’s profound critique of representation in the sciences of the Enlightenment. One never recalls anything, Biran writes, except the body’s own acts, which reflect to us not a faithful image of the object, but the sensation of the voluntary effort that is the true cause of our experience. This perspective, I will argue, is the only way to reconcile our reading of Rameau’s texts with his own staunch conviction of the sensory and experiential roots of his theory.</p>

<p class="abs-title">A. B. Marx and the Politics of Sonata Form</p>
<p class="abs-author">August Sheehy (Stony Brook University)</p>

<p>“The arts share a common fate with politics,” wrote Adolf Bernhard Marx in the first essay published in the first issue of <em>Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</em> in 1824. Taking Marx at his word, this paper considers the entanglement of music theory and politics in Marx’s well-known and influential theorization of sonata form. Connecting Marx’s own Jewish background, his writings from the <em>BamZ</em> (1824–30) to his <em>Memoirs</em> (1865), and the socio-political contexts in which he wrote, I argue that Marx’s concept of “freedom” was more than an artistic or metaphysical conceit; it also functioned as an answer to the so-called “Jewish question” of emancipation, brought into the public sphere by the publication of Christian Wilhelm Dohm’s <em>On the Civil Improvement of the Jews</em> 1781 and concluded with the formation of a unified Germany and the granting of full rights to German Jews in 1871.</p>
<p>Marx’s theory of forms mirrored his liberal ideals, in which different elements were to be assimilated to the whole without losing their own identities. His pedagogical efforts aimed to inculcate those ideals in a wider audience. No music proved better suited to Marx’s task than that by Beethoven. As evidence, I survey Marx’s three essays on the composer’s Symphony no. 9 (1826, 1847, 1859) and show how Beethoven helped him articulate and refine his ideas over the course of his career in terms that were simultaneously musical, personal, social, and political.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Schenker’s Elucidations on Unfolding Compound Voices from <em>Der Tonwille 6</em> (1923) to <em>Der freie Satz</em> (1935)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rodney Garrison (SUNY Fredonia)</p>

<p>Some of Schenker’s most enlightening descriptions of compound voices do not involve words we might translate as “compound voice”; some involve “<em>Ausfaltung</em>” (unfolding). From <em>Der Tonwille 6</em> on, nearly fifty descriptions and sketches of compound voices involve an “unfolding” word that indicates a four-pitch symbol, and in five instances, a two-pitch symbol within a larger four-pitch symbol. The diagonally beamed two-pitch symbol is known as the “unfolding,” <em>Ausfaltung</em>, and saw-tooth symbol. Much to their credit, Cadwallader and Gagné are the first textbook authors to acknowledge the four-pitch symbol as an “unfolding;” however, they do so only in light of <em>Der freie Satz</em>, they avoid linking “unfolding” with any German word, and they use the symbol in only one unidentified, musical graph. The lingering pedagogical issues of disconnected history, incomplete discussion, and insufficient use are addressed through the elucidation of compound voice descriptions and sketches from <em>Der Tonwille 6</em> to <em>Der freie Satz</em>, including another pivotal one from the Oster Collection. Many descriptions of four-pitch unfoldings in musical graphs refer to one of two theoretical graphs. Consistencies between interrelated musical and theoretical graphs show us how four-pitch unfoldings and a prolonged version with six pitches convey compound voices, which clarifies how we may employ the unfolding in graphs. Additionally, how two- and four-pitch unfoldings relate to each other is gleaned through the study of the instances where they are paired and function collaboratively.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Rethinking Repetition: Schoenberg and the “endless reshaping of a basic shape”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Áine Heneghan (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>The central tenets of the so-called New <em>Formenlehre</em> project can be traced back to the writings of Schoenberg: his thinking on form, filtered through Ratz and Caplin, informs an analytical approach currently in vogue. And yet the concept of repetition, arguably the cornerstone of Schoenberg’s <em>Kompositionslehre</em>, remains trivialized at best and misunderstood at worst. Schoenberg’s pithy statement, “whatever happens in a piece of music is nothing but the endless reshaping of a basic shape,” gains clarity and specificity when read closely and in the context of his broader theoretical and creative output. Far more than a mere demonstration of organicism, it encapsulates a detailed and nuanced conception of repetition that has ramifications for how we think and write about musical form.</p>
<p>Careful reading of Schoenberg’s writings (theoretical, analytical, and pedagogical) reveals consistency across his European and American periods and a quest for terminological precision in both German and English. In contemplating how the listener might discern repetition in its manifold guises, he enumerates not only categories of repetition—exact, modified, and developed—but also degrees of emphasis, criteria for which include the number, significance, and conspicuousness of what is repeated. Deploying this lexicon, I provide an analysis of the Gigue from Schoenberg’s <em>Suite für Klavier</em>. Recognizing the multivalency of repetition enables us to come closer to understanding his conception of the multi-dimensional musical object and, beyond that, the more elusive “presentation” [<em>Darstellung</em>].</p>
