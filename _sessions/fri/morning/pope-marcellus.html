<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Palestrina’s Missa Papae Marcelli is said (however light the evidence) to have been considered by the Council of Trent and, upon being judged understandable, to have saved polyphony. We propose a reconsideration of this work, with new questions: What can we learn about Palestrina’s musical ideals from analysis of this work? What makes this piece unique in Palestrina’s output? What musical elements appeal to modern performers and listeners? And how might we re-imagine such a familiar and seemingly simple piece? These questions highlight two important goals of this session: first, to learn from the score itself; and second, to foster both historicist and presentist views of the piece. Palestrina’s music has traditionally been studied by editor-scholars or historians looking for historical information and style characteristics (Lockwood 1975, Owens 1997a, Owens 1997b, the work of Jeppesen) or by scholars seeking to answer theoretical questions, particularly about mode (as in the work of Harold Powers). While more focused analytical studies on Palestrina have been done (Schubert 2007 is a notable example), they have yet to blossom into the large range of methods applied in the appreciation of music by composers of the common practice. Perhaps more important, while there is indeed more than one accepted way to analyze this repertoire—for example, through modal markers and through counterpoint—the emphasis in many of our field’s publication venues on expounding new theories means that we often miss the insights available from the juxtaposition of multiple approaches, and particularly of both presentist and historicist approaches.</p>
<p>Our fundamental aim is to facilitate multidimensional discussion of a unique and powerful piece through six short talks of 10 minutes followed by time for questions and discussion. These talks bring together a number of important threads in recent music-analytical/theoretical discourse. In juxtaposing traditional modes of analysis with newer ones, we aim to broaden the range of accepted approaches to the analysis of early music and to gain insight that can come only from multiple perspectives.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Palestrina, Zarlino, and the Cadence</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kyle Adams (Indiana University)</p>

<p>This talk will use the Kyrie from the <i>Missa Papae Marcelli </i>to explore the concept of cadence in the sixteenth century, both from a contemporaneous perspective and from a modern one. Using a close—albeit brief—reading of Zarlino’s discussion of cadences, I will demonstrate that much modern pedagogy on the sixteenth-century cadence has overemphasized the <i>clausula vera</i>. I will propose that several resting points in Palestrina’s Kyrie function as ancestral forms of the half-cadence and plagal cadence, laying the groundwork for those types of cadences and their ability to demarcate formal units in later music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Phrygian Expectations and Denials</p>
<p class="abs-author">Devin Chaloux (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Multiple times in Palestrina’s Pope Marcellus Mass, a properly prepared clausula vera on E does not resolve as a Phrygian cadence. In most cases, the descending voice leaps by fourth to C rather than by half step to E. These denied Phrygian cadences allow other Phrygian expectations to be subverted, especially in areas where cadential ficta is complicated by the entrances that immediately follow the cadence. These moments allow Palestrina to evoke Phrygian rhetoric without straying too far from C Ionian tonal space.</p>

<p class="abs-title"><i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i>: Performance Analysis</p>
<p class="abs-author">Timothy Chenette (Utah State University)</p>

<p>I will assume that the most productive analytical stance is a dialogue between past and present, and that every performance is also an act of analysis, and ask what in the score may have inspired approaches to dynamics in modern recordings of the Agnus Dei. I will moderate between score and recordings, pointing out consistent approaches to sequences, apparent harmonic arrivals, and treatment of minor sonorities. These and other passages suggest some of what appeals to us in this music—and, perhaps, to its contemporaries as well.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Harmonic extroversion in the <i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Dmitri Tymoczko (Princeton University)</p>

<p>I will argue that Palestrina’s Pope Marcellus Mass is harmonically unusual when compared to a broader sample of his work: in particular it is considerably more functionally tonal than his other Ionian-mode pieces, drawing (I shall argue) on harmonic routines of early 16th-century popular practice. Using extensive statistics as well as analyses of particular passages, I will propose that this harmonically “extroverted” style, evident in both homophonic and polyphonic passages, has helped sustain the legends surrounding the piece.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Analyzing the Agnus Dei 2 from Palestrina’s Pope Marcellus
  Mass</p>
<p class="abs-author">Denis Collins (University of Queensland, Australia) and Jason Stoessel (University of New England, Australia)</p>

<p>We analyze the stacked canonic structure of this movement using a computational model that calculates both the horizontal sequences of intervals and the vertical pitch combinations across all voices. This multidimensional approach helps develop our understanding of compositional decisions to elaborate on the fixed principles of canonic voice-leading, especially when inexact repetitions of blocks or modules occur within the overall polyphonic fabric. We can therefore assess the extent to which the non-canonic voices are fundamental to the overall structure and gain insights into the relationships between harmonic and contrapuntal considerations informing Palestrina’s compositional planning.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Analysis Using Alternative Visualizations for Analysis in the
  Benedictus and Agnus Dei</p>
<p class="abs-author">John Z. McKay (University of South Carolina)</p>

<p>Computerized musical analysis has greatly simplified the process of creating new representations of musical data in various forms. While score-based analysis may often aim to start from an objective perspective of “the notes on the page,” the nature of those notes and our perception of them is obviously impacted by the way we represent them visually. A modern score of Palestrina’s <i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i> is already a graphical abstraction derived from individual vocal lines laid out separately in early printed publications, often supplemented with editorial barlines and other performance indications. This presentation will review a series of alternative graphical representations and abstractions of musical material from the Benedictus and Agnus Dei sections, ranging from a familiar “piano roll” format to graphs and charts bringing out elements such as dissonance, texture, motives, rhythm, and modal features. Like the modern score format, viewing the piece from other graphical perspectives literally changes how we “see” (and thus analyze) this musical work.</p>
