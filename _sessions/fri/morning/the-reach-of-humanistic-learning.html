<p class="abs-title">Johannes Kepler’s Astro-Musical Soul and Early Modern Speculative Music Theory</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nicholas Johnson (Butler University)</p>

<p>In the early 1600s, Johannes Kepler laid the groundwork for modern-day astronomy by confirming the heliocentric universe, calculating the changing speeds of the planets, and charting their elliptical orbits. These developments challenged the centuries-old model of the music of the spheres, the belief that the planets produce music and influence the earth through divine harmony. Contemporary speculative music theorists, those concerned with the classical <em>musica mundana</em> and <em>musica humana</em>, took up the challenge of reconciling musical styles with these astronomical discoveries. As a speculative theorist himself, Kepler was an active participant in the debates: his <em>Harmonices Mundi</em> (1618) was the period’s most exhaustive discussion of astronomy and music.</p>
<p>One of Kepler’s primary contributions to music theory was a refined system connecting the ratios that govern the planetary orbits to a measuring device in the soul that distinguishes musical consonance from dissonance. Joscelyn Godwin and D. P. Walker have explored Kepler’s argument that God modeled the soul after the same ratios that govern the universe. Using recent research on the prevalent compositional styles in Prague during Kepler’s lengthy tenure in the city, I offer a more complete picture of his inspirations. I contend that Kepler’s astro-musical soul stemmed from his humanistic interpretation of Ptolemaic doctrine, contemporary musical developments, and his own astronomical discoveries.</p>
<p>Writing over fifty years after Copernicus’s momentous <em>De revolutionibus</em>, Kepler worked actively to prove the validity of a heliocentric universe. To test his discovery of elliptical planetary orbits around a stationary sun, contrasting the Aristotelian revolutions of perfect circles, he devised an exhaustive system linking just intonation, the preferred temperament in Prague, with these elliptical orbits. By comparing the created ratios with his own discoveries of astrological correlations between the planets and humans, he argued that the soul must be constructed of the same ratios as the universe. His description of the soul as consisting of musical intervals was not entirely novel, but the mathematical rigor behind his theory, coupled with his reputation as an astronomer, laid a foundation for Lutheran speculative music theory over the next century.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Pills to Purge Melancholy”: The Restorative Power of Songs in Restoration England</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sarah Koval (University of Toronto)</p>

<p>Henry Purcell’s famous mad song, “From Rosy Bow’rs,” was written for Thomas Durfey’s <em>Comical History of Don Quixote</em> (1695), later appearing in a six-volume collection of Durfey’s song lyrics, entitled <em>Wit and Mirth: Or Pills to Purge Melancholy</em> (1698–1720), issued by Henry Playford. While such Restoration drama was once considered a failed English opera, recent scholarship has noted the unique characteristics of this genre, which combines staging, songs, English masque, and dance. In particular, I build on the theory that Restoration songs functioned as extractable entities, distinct from particular theatrical moments (Dugaw, 1990). These songs were often repurposed for use in other plays, broadside ballads, and even—as I suggest here—for healing. I explore the way “From Rosy Bow’rs” moved beyond its original context as a musical-theatrical representation of feigned madness, gaining medical significance within Durfey’s collection.</p>
<p>While the title, <em>Pills to Purge Melancholy</em>, may seem like a mere witticism on Durfey’s part, my research reveals that London publishers during this period routinely used the term “pill” to denote a song or poem, marketing song collections for their curative powers in volumes such as Robert Wood’s <em>A Pill to Purge Melancholy</em> (1653), Thomas Playford’s <em>An Antidote against Melancholy made up in Pills</em> (1661), and the anonymous <em>A Tory Pill to Purge Whig Melancholy</em> (1715). I suggest that “From Rosy Bow’rs” was uniquely suited to anthologizing as the first “Pill” within Wit and Mirth, because both its text and its music engaged conspicuously with literary and medical discourses of melancholy. Key theoretical texts include Robert Burton’s <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> and Jacques Ferrand’s <em>Erotomania</em>, which reveal a complex entanglement of literary, musical, and medical modes of understanding. The “five stages of madness” depicted within “From Rosy Bow’rs” reflect these theorists’ attempts to categorize melancholic afflictions using literary characters as medical case studies; music is one of their many proposed treatments. Drawing upon this medical discourse and on conventions of Restoration song, we can reconstruct the metaphor of songs as “pills” and gain a unique window into notions of musical effect in the early modern period.</p>


<p class="abs-title">“Marketh it well”: William Bathe’s Table (1596) and Experimental Practice</p>
<p class="abs-author">Loren Ludwig (University of Virginia)</p>


<p>In 1596 William Bathe, an Oxford-educated Irish musician who would later have an illustrious career as a Jesuit scholar on the continent, published a diminutive composition treatise, <em>A Briefe Introduction to the skill of Song</em>. While Bathe’s treatise has been recognized as perhaps the earliest source of a new four-syllable solmization scheme that would herald the end of hexachordal solmization, a fascinating and little-known contribution appears later in the volume. Bathe’s “Table of Song” is a tabular algorithm for composing imitative polyphony, a one-page grid with a series of accompanying rules that reduces canonic composition to a straightforward series of instructions. While it is tempting to compare Bathe’s work to similar (and later) musical projects by Robert Fludd and Athanasius Kircher (both of whom may have been influenced by Bathe’s publication), I will present Bathe’s tabular algorithm in a new context, the emergent natural philosophy of late sixteenth-century England.</p>
<p>This project investigates Bathe’s table as a site of experimentation—one that, like the alchemical tradition with which it is closely associated (as I will demonstrate), partakes both of an inherited mysticism and rigorous analytical empiricism. Bathe’s table encodes not just a complex set of compositional rules, but an experimental practice that only becomes visible in proximity to contemporaneous analytical tools, such as Gunter’s quadrant. Like Gunter’s quadrant, which elicited publications enumerating many new and ingenious uses for this relatively simple tool, Bathe’s table can be enlisted in musico-analytical projects that go far beyond Bathe’s cursory discussion of its potential compositional uses. For those who “marketh it well,” as Bathe explains, the table reveals recondite aspects of changing late-Renaissance conceptions of music, musical space, and canonic practice, ones that connect an inherited tradition of music as a microcosm of Universal order to emergent practices of experimental philosophy.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Between Humanism and Praxis: Concepts of Musical Literacy in Early Modern Europe</p>
<p class="abs-author">Joseph Ortiz (University of Texas at El Paso)</p>

<p>This paper explores the development of musical education in early modern Europe, using as a test case John Taverner’s <em>On the Origin and Development of Music</em>, a series of music lectures delivered at Gresham College London between 1610 and 1638. Taverner’s lectures are the only extant version of a complete university course in music in early modern England, though they have never been published or addressed in conventional histories of music. Taverner’s lectures are significant for their attempt to ground musical study in humanist principles, particularly Latin and Greek philology, and in this way they stand in opposition to the predominance of practical music education in early modern Europe. They are also significant in light of the fact that Gresham College was at the time a new, progressive experiment in “democratic” education, having been founded as an attempt to educate London citizens and businessmen who generally would not have attended Oxford or Cambridge. In this way, Taverner’s approach to musical education (which was followed by his predecessors) challenges the notion that musical literacy for non-academic persons in early modern Europe primarily meant the ability to sight-sing or perform an instrument. Instead, Taverner’s lectures suggest that, for metropolitan citizens and for businessmen traveling in Continental Europe, musical literacy meant a familiarity with the classical Greek and Latin writers on music, as well as with the major historical and philosophical aspects of music. Given both the rapid development of musical styles across the Continent and conflicting attitudes toward music among Protestant and Catholic polemicists, a humanistic approach to music that provided a kind of “common language” for commercial and diplomatic agents may very well have been seen by some as a more useful, pragmatic musical literacy in early modern Europe.</p>
