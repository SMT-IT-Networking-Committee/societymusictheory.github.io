<p class="abs-title">Derivatives: How Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” and Claude François’s “Comme d’habitude” Are Different Songs</p>
<p class="abs-author">Evan Ware (Madonna University)</p>

<p>French pop star Claude François considered Frank Sinatra’s recording of “My Way” (1969) to be an homage, misreading it as a cover version of his earlier “Comme d’habitude” [“As Usual”] (1967). This speaks directly to an ambiguity that surrounds the analytic consideration of cover songs. Although “My Way” was built on the same harmonies and melodies as “Comme d’habitude,” its lyrics, which speak to triumph at the end of life, are completely new and stand in striking contrast to the original’s, which describe a failing romantic relationship. Given such an extensive narrative and affective change, can Sinatra’s recording really be considered a cover?</p>
<p>This paper proposes a new category of song reproduction, “derivatives,” that arise when totally new lyrics are added to the music of a previous work. I start from David Laing’s observation that lyrics specify a song’s human universe. Musical signifiers, therefore, establish general expressive parameters that can create new meanings when combined with different words. To illustrate, I use an adaptation of Philip Tagg’s interobjective comparison, whereby marked musical gestures, or tropes, shared by the Sinatra and François songs, are correlated with similar gestures in the singers’ other works. By analyzing the recurring narrative and affective uses of these tropes, I argue that the musical signifiers common to both songs not only effectively support the different lyrics, but are refocused by them, giving rise to very different human universes, and, as a result, two different songs.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Multiple Metric Transcriptions and Text Expression in Bob Dylan’s “With God on Our Side”</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nancy Murphy (University of British Columbia)</p>

<p>The 1965 studio recording of Bob Dylan’s “With God on Our Side” engages several aspects of meter that cannot be represented in a single transcription. It features timing fluctuations that make choosing a tactus difficult, and its shifts between clear compound-quadruple and compound-triple meter, as well as its varying rhythmic density in guitar strumming, make existing transcriptions in a steady meter incomplete or even misrepresentative. For any one transcription, the analyst must make decisions, informed by a particular metric theory, about which components are essential. But these decisions require the analyst to disregard other, possibly expressive aspects of meter that could be brought out by transcriptions informed by other theories of meter. As a solution, this paper advocates for metric analysis using multiple transcriptions, drawing on theories of meter as hierarchy and metric projection, and offers a model for constructing and coordinating the metrical readings they express, considering how each reading conveys lyrical meaning.</p>
