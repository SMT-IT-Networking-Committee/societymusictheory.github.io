<hr class="sep">

<p>Aural skills are cognitive skills—yet the fields of aural skills pedagogy
and research in perception/cognition have a fraught relationship. Aural skills
teaching is, to many, more of an art than a science, and accordingly relies to
a great extent on instructors’ experiences and traditional training. While
cognitive research has a greater emphasis on the “provable,” it is also often
susceptible to criticism for investigating phenomena in controlled,
ecologically questionable environments, limiting the direct applicability of
findings to pedagogical practice. Nevertheless, these fields have great
potential to be enriched through contact with each other.</p>

<p>In order to forge stronger connections between these fields and promote
improvement in aural skills education, this session combines prepared
presentations, a response from an expert, and time reserved for community
discussion. We will begin with three eighteen-minute presentations, described
below, evaluating aspects of current aural skills pedagogy in light of recent
cognitive research, followed by a ten-minute response from Dr. Elizabeth West
Marvin. The remaining time will be open for those in attendance—the panel of
presenters, the respondent, and all members of the audience—to participate in
a discussion of aural skills training in general and its relationship with the
cognitive sciences in particular. We consider this forum for the community to
discuss past, current, and future practice a crucial aspect of our
session.</p>
