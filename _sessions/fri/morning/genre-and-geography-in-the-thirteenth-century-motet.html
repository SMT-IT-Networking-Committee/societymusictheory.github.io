<p class="abs-title">Mini Clausulae and the <em>Magnus liber organi</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Catherine Bradley (Stony Brook University)</p>

<p>A mid-thirteenth-century manuscript copied for the Parisian Cathedral of Notre Dame (Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plut. 29.1) uniquely records, in fewer than seven folios, a collection of 154 individual pieces associated with a crucial moment in the history of polyphonic composition. These so-called mini clausulae—brief two-voice settings of plainchant snippets—were cited by William Waite in 1961 as concrete musical evidence of a process described by the medieval theorist known as Anonymous IV. In a much-quoted passage, Anonymous IV states that Perotin “abbreviated” (<em>abbreviavit eundem</em>) Leonin’s older “Great Book of organum” (<em>Magnus liber organi</em>) with clausulae in the new note-against-note discant style. The mini clausulae, therefore, emerge as exceptional in a thirteenth-century context: a repertory attributable to a particular composer—Perotin—and about which specific stylistic and chronological information is known.</p>
<p>Despite their historiographical importance, these pieces have been dismissed as “of little purely musical interest” (Smith, 1966) and remain, as Alejandro Planchart noted in 2003, “a largely unexamined repertory.” This paper challenges received views of the mini clausulae, scrutinizing for the first time their musical and liturgical characteristics. I demonstrate that a significant proportion of these clausulae cannot constitute straightforward “abbreviations” vis-à-vis an older <em>Magnus liber</em>. Significantly, the mini clausulae differ also in their liturgical ordering, implied use, and in the details of their plainchant melodies from this “central” Notre-Dame polyphonic tradition of which they have been presumed to be part.</p>
<p>Posing new questions about the function, performance contexts, transmission, and dissemination of the mini clausulae, I recast understandings of this compositionally modest and seemingly marginal repertory in relation to the widely copied and virtuosic organa of the <em>Magnus liber</em>. Despite their limited manuscript survival, I argue that the mini clausulae constitute hitherto overlooked evidence of otherwise lost musical practices. Paradoxically, this unassuming collection may represent a significant trace of a simple and highly functional kind of early polyphony in wider oral circulation, distinct from, and perhaps more representative of common musical practice in the thirteenth century than the monumental organa of the “Great Book.”</p>


<p class="abs-title">The <em>Chansonnier du Roi</em>, Naples, and the Geography of Thirteenth-Century Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Alèxandros Maria Hatzikiriakos (University of Rome-Sapienza)</p>

<p>The French chansonnier Paris, BNF f. fr. 844 (generally known as <em>Chansonnier du Roi</em>) is one of the earliest and most important sources for trouvère and troubadour lyrics, but also for early motets in modal notation. Compiled around 1250, possibly in Northern France, the manuscript was later enriched, by many different hands, with a unique collection of Occitan, French, and Latin monophonic songs and instrumental dances in mensural notation. Although this chansonnier was neglected for decades after the pivotal studies by Pierre Aubry, Jean Beck and Hans Spanke, interest in it has flourished since the 1990s on the part of both musicologists (Peraino and Haines) and romance philologists (Asperti and Battelli). Insights from these two disciplinary fields, however, have never been systematically brought together. This is what I aim to do in this paper, focusing in particular on the later additions to the manuscript, about which I will also present new palaeographical evidence.</p>
<p>My central hypothesis is that fr. 844 was brought to the Angevin court of Naples, probably around 1282, by Robert II of Artois. Intellectuals, poets, and artists from Northern France, Occitania, and the Aragonese kingdom contributed to the particularly multicultural milieu of this court from 1266 until the death of Charles I in 1285. This milieu, as important as it was ephemeral, represents the most plausible site where the chansonnier could have been exposed to new musical and poetic styles.</p>
<p>Moreover, the compilers’ predilection for literary genres specifically connected to dance and music, their use of mensural notation, some peculiar metrical and formal irregularities, and some <em>mise en texte</em> strategies show a unique interest in sound and performance. In fact, many of the additions can be understood as a reshaping of older forms into new ones, in keeping with the peculiarities of the Angevin reception of French and Occitan monophony. These features place the <em>Chansonnier du Roi</em> in the context of a process of identity formation for the French elite newly settled in Italy, an identity shaped in considerable part by music and sound. In conclusion, I make some suggestions toward an expansion of the geography of thirteenth-century vernacular monophony, claiming that Naples might have played a more central role than it has hitherto been granted.</p>


<p class="abs-title">A Conductus, an Organum, and a Very Poor Loser: Philip the Chancellor, Pérotin, and the Paris Bishop’s Election of 1227–28</p>
<p class="abs-author">Thomas B. Payne (College of William &amp; Mary)</p>

<p>A newly identified pair of discrete musical concordances between the organum triplum <em>Alleluia Posui adiutorium</em> by Perotin and Philip the Chancellor’s widely traveled conductus/lai <em>Veritas equitas largitas</em> (also transmitted as two vernacular <em>contrafacta</em>) offers new opportunities to interrogate these interconnected works. Since Philip’s lyric appears to have been written in the aftermath of the contested installation of William of Auvergne as bishop of Paris in 1227–28, in which the Chancellor played a bitter adversarial role, the results suggest that a striking convergence of artistic, historical, and even personal circumstances lies behind the creation of <em>Veritas equitas</em> and Perotin’s organum.</p>
<p>From all appearances, it seems that Perotin, working in collusion with Philip, inserted carefully chosen melodic phrases from his colleague’s <em>Veritas</em> into his own three-voice <em>Alleluia Posui</em> to signal (albeit surreptitiously) their shared dissatisfaction with the naming of William of Auvergne by the pope on 10 April 1228. Such a conclusion not only presents a rare (if not unique) instance where music from an existing conductus was re-purposed to serve in an organum (rather than the reverse), it also suggests that Perotin’s <em>Alleluia Posui</em> was written sometime between William’s installation as bishop and Philip the Chancellor’s death around Christmas, 1236, at the very latest. Furthermore, these circumstances solidify earlier claims that Philip and Perotin were active, two-way collaborators, and that Perotin (whoever he may have been) was not only alive, but was actively engaged in composition as late as April of 1228.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Motets in Songbooks and the Borderland Culture of the Thirteenth-Century Motet</p>
<p class="abs-author">Gaël Saint-Cricq (Université de Rouen)</p>


<p>Alongside the central collections recorded in Parisian motet and liturgical books, the repertory of the thirteenth-century motet offers no less than two hundred and nine works that are recorded in provincial chansonniers. These works point to a motet culture developing outside the central production area of Paris, and raise a question not often broached in recent musicological commentaries. Indeed, these works invite reflection on ties to borderland culture, especially to Trouvère song culture and repertory, a matter that has been largely obscured by the dominant role of Paris and Notre-Dame repertory not only in the creation and development of the motet but also in the preservation of the repertory.</p>
<p>Among these sources, the motet collections of the Noailles Chansonnier (BnF, f.fr. 12615 or N) and the Chansonnier du Roi (BnF, f.fr. 844 or R) offer an exceptional field of inquiry for the search of works within the thirteenth-century motet repertoire that were cultivated apart from the central Parisian tradition of the motet. Copied between in the 1270s in Artois and possibly Arras, these collections offer, of their ninety-one specimens, no less than fifty motets found only in N and R. The context of their preservation confers on it moreover, a particular place in the history of the repertoire, for N and R are the two largest repositories of polyphonic motets preserved in provincial songbooks, where they are surrounded by various other lyric and non-lyric collections, some typical of Artois and the city of Arras.</p>
<p>This paper will demonstrate that part of the motet collections in N and R constitute a gathering of local works, stemming from the musical and literary culture of Arras, and related to song practice. Evidence in the structure and composition of the codex, the practice of self-referential quotations within the manuscript as a whole and Artesian culture, and finally the presence of idiomatic phrasings in the tenors, the texts and the compositional procedures, all points to a specifically Artesian cultivation and practice of the motet, providing an original, sometimes alternative, perspective on the genre.</p>
