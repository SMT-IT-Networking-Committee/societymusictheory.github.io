<p class="abs-title">Olin Downes and the Soviets</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kevin Bartig (Michigan State University)</p>

<p>Throughout his long career the influential <em>New York Times</em> music critic Olin Downes (1886–1955) introduced the American public to unfamiliar Russian and Soviet repertory, from Arsenii Avraamov’s sound experiments to Sergei Prokofiev’s wartime piano sonatas. He elucidated Soviet musical culture through radio programs and lectures and advised the U.S. State Department on matters of Soviet cultural diplomacy. Like many American intellectuals of his generation, Downes moved in leftist circles and supported a range of progressive causes. Given this convergence of musical and political interests, scholars have presumed that communist sympathies or even financial incentives from Soviet bureaucrats compromised his criticism.</p>
<p>Such assertions are made in the absence of any sustained analysis of Downes’s politics or his first-hand experience with Soviet Russia, particularly his tours of the USSR in 1929 and 1932. During these little-known visits he evaluated new compositions and consulted with cultural bureaucrats on institutional structures. Using Soviet documents and Downes’s personal records, I reconstruct his tours for the first time in order to demonstrate their enduring impact on his later criticism. In fact, the Soviet tours fostered Downes’s distaste for politically motivated art music. He was instead fascinated by rural vernacular music, which he perceived as unsoiled by ideology. He championed concert works that both appropriated such music and celebrated its function in a realist fashion, a criterion by which he subsequently judged both Russian and American repertory. For example, he described Modest Musorgsky’s <em>Boris Godunov</em> in much the same way that he would later praise Richard Rodgers’s <em>Oklahoma!</em>. Moreover, he deplored the ideological excesses and violence of Soviet power while praising its institutionalized support of art. Indeed, the latter inspired his frequent pleas for government-sponsored support at home, most notably for opera.</p>
<p>Downes was neither dupe nor sympathizer. He was, I argue, a perceptive critic whose views were deeply rooted in transnational encounter. This new portrait of Downes adds to our understanding of the transmission and reception of musical works through professional networks and ultimately allows us to reconsider how the Soviet experiment shaped American musical culture.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Cultivating the Middle East: The German Democratic Republic on Tour</p>
<p class="abs-author">Elaine Kelly (University of Edinburgh)</p>

<p>Music was pivotal in providing the German Democratic Republic (GDR) with an international platform during the Cold War. Denied diplomatic recognition by most western nations until the early 1970s, the state depended on its artists to negotiate its image abroad and channeled considerable resources to enable elite ensembles to make regular international tours. The importance placed on the power of music in this context reflected the government’s profoundly conflicted self-image. On the one hand, its significant investment in musical diplomacy was prompted by deep-seated insecurities wrought by the existence of a second German state. It was also, however, indicative of a supreme confidence in East Germany’s cultural prowess, a confidence that was born of the founding myth that positioned the GDR as the successor to all that was positive in the Germanic cultural heritage.</p>
<p>These tensions emerge particularly clearly in the GDR’s dealings with the Middle East during the 1960s. In addition to sending a series of “musical experts” to Egypt to assist with the development of the state’s cultural life, the GDR also funded concert tours in Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria by ensembles such as the Dresdner Philharmonie, the Gewandhausorchester, and the Deutsche Staatsoper. These endeavors were symptomatic of the changing power dynamics of the post-colonial world, and reflected the GDR’s very real need for political support from the Arab states. This need, however, by no means precluded the persistence of old imperial mind-sets where cultural matters were concerned. As a study of these concert tours demonstrates, while East German perceptions of the Middle East were shaped to some extent by Marxist constructs of the developing world, they also betrayed an enduring belief in the humanizing capacity and superiority of the western canon. This paper will explore the interweaving discourses of Marxism, orientalism, neo-colonialism, and anti-Semitism in which East German concert tours to the Middle East were situated. It will examine how these tours were conceived of in terms of their intended audiences, and will consider how they subsequently served, through reports of them in the East German media, to repackage the Middle East for consumption back home.</p>

<p class="abs-title">East German Listening Lessons: Pedagogy and the Idea of Musical Content in the German Democratic Republic</p>
<p class="abs-author">Anicia Timberlake (Williams College)</p>

<p>In 1959, the Institute for Music at the University of Halle embarked on a research program to study musical reception. Over the next few years, the Institute sent music teachers and student researchers to local schools, where they tried out new methods for teaching young children to understand music. The research project aimed to instill in children an “urgent need” to listen to the German classical canon and to prepare them to be an audience for new socialist music. In this paper, I examine how these listening experiments served as a practical testing ground not only for pedagogical methods, but also for new theories of musical content. Following Marxist aesthetics that maintained that art reflected social relations, East German musicologists posited that music reflected history’s inherently progressive tendencies. This utopian promise was thought to be objectively present in all great musical works; learning to listen to music correctly meant learning to distill historical facts from musical sound.</p>
<p>Yet the researchers were pedagogues first, and scholars second. These largely unpublished studies reveal them struggling to reconcile Marxist theories with practical matters of teaching. In all cases, doctrinaire content gave way to the intractable reality of child development. Believing that young children were physiologically incapable of abstract thought, teachers focused on training them to hear musical “character” and narrative rather than connections between sound and social progress. These lessons show that the East German musical canon, as it was taught to listeners, ended up more traditionalist than GDR musicologists had planned, prizing not new socialist compositions but nineteenth-century works for orchestra and piano. This is not to say that Marxist theories were disproved in the classroom, or that these theories were untenable because of their explicitly political bent. In reworking historical “content” for children’s consumption, teachers developed new methods that sought to ground listening in extra-musical meaning—broadly construed—rather than in the purely formal concerns that had marked previous pedagogies. East German listening lessons thus shared a common cause with a larger set of postwar creative impulses, including those that would later shape the Anglo-American New Musicology.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The Arnshtam/Shostakovich Collaboration: Scoring Women in the Soviet War Film</p>
<p class="abs-author">Joan Titus (University of North Carolina at Greensboro)</p>

<p>Sound designer, musician, and film director Leo Arnshtam collaborated with composer Dmitry Shostakovich on three woman’s war films during their lifetimes—<em>Girlfriends</em> (<em>Podrugi</em>, 1935–36), <em>Zoya</em> (1944), and <em>Sofya Perovskaya</em> (1967). Yet these scores, and the issues of gender and cultural politics that they reference, have received little attention despite this known collaboration. Beginning with <em>Girlfriends</em>, the director and composer sought to construct Soviet femininity in response to mid-1930s cultural politics. The duo continued this endeavor in two historical films, <em>Zoya</em> and <em>Sofya Perovskaya</em>, both engaging the role of heroines and femininity in nostalgic revisions of two historical events—the assassination of Tsar Aleksandr II by the pre-revolutionary group <em>Narodnaya volya</em> (the People’s Will), and the Second World War. Building on their sound experiments and the tropes used in <em>Girlfriends</em>, the scores to these films buttress the construction of the Soviet woman using cues that simultaneously narrate war and femininity. From trumpet calls to other <em>topoi</em> in original underscoring, these heroines are depicted as part of a nostalgic and revised Soviet past that situated women as important yet subjugated members of Soviet society. Scoring the new and feminized Soviet woman through the emerging war film, arguably beginning in the mid-1930s, was a construction that was iterated during Stalinism and beyond.</p>
<p>This paper provides a discussion of the theories and practices that emerged from the Arnshtam/Shostakovich collaboration in the scores to <em>Zoya</em> and <em>Sofya Perovskaya</em>. In my discussion of these scores, I address specific musical cues that interact with the current standards for femininity in wartime and postwar Soviet society. Using the writings and theories of Arnshtam and Shostakovich, and contemporaneous press, I provide an analysis of these cues to understand the ways that the director and composer constructed femininity in response to trends in cultural politics and waves of feminism. Such an examination contributes to discussions about reciprocal flows of constructed femininity in musical-cinematic representations and the nature of wartime and postwar Soviet identity; and more broadly, illuminates how two prominent music/film figures theorized musical narration in Soviet cinema.</p>
