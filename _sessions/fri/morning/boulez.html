<p class="abs-title">The Melodies of <em>L’Orestie</em> and Pierre Boulez’s New Compositional Method</p>
<p class="abs-author">Joseph Salem (University of Victoria)</p>

<p><em>L’Orestie</em> is Pierre Boulez’s only major orchestral work for theater. It was commissioned by the <em>Compagnie Madeleine Renaud</em>—<em>Jean-Louis Barrault</em> in the fall of 1954 for the spring of 1955, and it has since been withdrawn from the composer’s catalogue. The work is arguably Boulez’s longest, yet it was written quickly, among a host of professional and personal distractions. These contextual conditions undoubtedly affected how the work was composed, including changes to Boulez’s usual organizational (or “serial”) processes.</p>
<p>My paper discusses the compositional process behind two elements of the finale to the three-act tragedy, including the generation and development of a key vocal part, as well as the development of an instrumental introduction and corresponding refrain. Tracing the rather varied development of these compositional elements reveals a host of entirely new and surprising compositional procedures, including several non-serial techniques for creating and expanding this movement from a single vocal particella to a large-scale finale with independent instrumental interludes. While a number of these tactics were likely pragmatic solutions designed to accommodate the hurried rehearsal schedule of the theater, they ultimately foreshadow a number of significant changes to Boulez’s working method in a myriad of later works.</p>

<p>The musical sketches for Boulez’s <em>Éclat</em> (1965) are a goldmine of information for the music scholar. Minute annotations scribbled between the staves and in the margins of a score for <em>Don</em> (first version, piano, voice, 1960), when properly deciphered, clarify every stage of the compositional process that led to <em>Éclat</em>. However, the characteristically numerous stages of the generative process problematize the issue of their perceptual connotations and salience as structural markers within the final musical product. Many authors (Cone 1960, Lerdahl 1988, Guldbransen 1997, Meston 2001, Goldman 2011 and Salem 2014) have, in fact, claimed that Boulez’s generative techniques do not have implications in the realm of perception.</p>
<p>This paper will demonstrate how the annotations on a score copy of Boulez’s <em>Don</em> outline the skeleton (background scheme) for the entire opening piano Cadenza of <em>Éclat</em>. Analyzing the sketch by delving beyond the question of how the foreground material was generated to why these processes were used, demonstrates that the cadenza is structured in a manner highly analogous to a traditional concerto cadenza, consisting of an expansion of four germinal chords. Furthermore, it shows that the isomorphic relationships underlying the generative techniques have structural and musical repercussions that are taken maximum advantage of in the transfer from sketch to final musical product. Ultimately, the analysis produces graphs that compile the various stages of process shown in the sketches and illustrate how they elucidate a perceptible middleground organization.</p>
