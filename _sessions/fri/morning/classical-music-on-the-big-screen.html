<p class="abs-title">Movies at the Met? Space and Meaning in Early Film Screenings</p>
<p class="abs-author">Erin Brooks (SUNY Potsdam)</p>

<p>On 1 October 1915, thousands of spectators crowded Boston’s Symphony Hall for the premiere of Paramount’s <em>Carmen</em>, a film starring soprano Geraldine Farrar, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, and accompanied by re-orchestrated snippets of Bizet’s music. Noting the first incursion of film into Symphony Hall, the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> commented that this venue, “probably the largest auditorium devoted exclusively to music of the better sort, lends a spirit of serious artistic endeavor to Miss Farrar’s photodramatic enterprise.” Symphony Hall was not the only “serious” venue sharing space with early films; opera houses such as Covent Garden also hosted screenings in the 1910s and ‘20s. The Metropolitan Opera, on the other hand, frequently refused such rental requests. While early film screenings in classical music venues have been noted by scholars, analysis of these events through a “phenomenology of <em>space</em>,<em>”</em> to borrow Robert Fink’s wording, has received less critical attention.</p>
<p>In this paper, I draw on reviews, publicity materials, and archival sources from orchestral and operatic institutions to analyze the spatial semiotics of early film screenings in symphony halls and opera houses. Marvin Carlson has analyzed how theater spaces are “deeply involved with the preservation and configuration of cultural memory,” and classical music venues indeed had powerful preexistent meanings for early cinema-goers. From the physical locations of the buildings to their architecture, interior decorations, and personnel, these spaces were “ghosted” by the memories of past <em>musical</em> performances. While today we regularly view opera at our local cinema multiplex or go to the symphony to watch films accompanied by live orchestra, I broaden this history of shared spaces by situating the performance practices and reception of the 1915 <em>Carmen</em> film and other screenings of the 1910s and ’20s within a longer narrative of cohabitation between music, opera, and cinema. Drawing from spectral studies and recent musicological considerations of space, I ultimately argue that early film screenings in classical music venues offer not only glimpses of contemporary audience experiences of both film and music, but also a new perspective on the complex debate over the cultural value of both music and moving image.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Bach Is a Great Responsibility”: the B-minor Mass in the Maksimova-Vasiliev film <em>Fouetté</em> (1986)</p>
<p class="abs-author">Olga Haldey (University of Maryland)</p>

<p>Soviet cinema of the 1980s—dark, gritty, and heavily politicized—has until recently been analyzed by both Russian and Western scholars primarily for its “message.” That is, it was seen as a kind of filmed literature—better yet, filmed newspaper reportage, unleashing upon its viewers unvarnished truth about the horrors of their past and the challenges of their present. In his article on Tengiz Abuladze’s 1984 <em>Repentance</em>, Peter Schmelz echoes cultural historian Mikhail Yampolsky’s admonition to see Soviet film as “not only character, plot, and conflict, [but] a dance of light, sound, face and body on the screen.”</p>
<p>Yampolsky’s insight proves particularly astute when confronting a less known contemporary of <em>Repentance</em>, the 1986 film <em>Fouetté</em>, directed by the Soviet ballet’s power couple, Ekaterina Maksimova and Sergei Vasiliev, who also star. <em>Fouetté</em> shares many features with the best of late Soviet cinema, including <em>Repentance</em> : its plot is layered rather than directional; realistic yet filled with metaphor and allegory; and beyond what it “says,” it has to be seen and, more importantly, heard. Outwardly a predictable “dance movie”—a rebel choreographer and an aging prima infatuated with him fight to stage a radical modern ballet at a stogy theater (i.e., the Kirov)—<em>Fouetté</em> quickly shows itself nothing of the kind. The storyline of the protagonists’ ballet—<em>The Master and Margarita</em>, after Mikhail Bulgakov’s cult novel—invades the main plot, injecting a dose of magic into its realism. And crucially, the film’s core message is contained not in its dialogue, but its unique blend of music and dance. The centerpiece of the soundtrack is J. S. Bach’s B-minor Mass—as one character pompously puts it, “a great responsibility.” First silent, then brittle and fragmented, the Mass is gradually reassembled to replace, and eventually displace spoken word for the final <em>pas-de-deux</em>, danced to <em>Et incarnatus est</em>. Fused into a complex counterpoint with the language of gesture, Bach’s score serves as the inner voice of <em>Fouetté</em> ’s often silent main characters, while also reflecting the polyphonic, polytemporal nature of the film’s literary inspiration.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“A Combination Made for Experiment”: Casa Ricordi, <em>Aida</em>, and Opera on Screen in 1911</p>
<p class="abs-author">Christy Thomas (Bates College)</p>

<p>Opera’s circulation via media technologies has sparked considerable musicological interest in recent years. In contrast to such contemporary phenomena as HD broadcasts, television opera, or mobile streaming, however, comparatively little attention has been paid to the impact of early-twentieth-century media technologies on the world of opera. The frequent assumption is that the operatic and emerging film industries remained largely separate until the mid-twentieth century, with opera’s influence on the new medium being unintentional and unilateral. Yet during the golden age of Italian silent cinema (1911–14), just over a decade after the medium’s birth, Casa Ricordi—Italy’s foremost music publisher—invested its own experience and reputation in a handful of joint endeavors with film companies. Because there was little precedent for how an opera might be represented in or appropriated by cinema, these ventures were highly experimental. Although these collaborations and their material products shed significant light on early encounters between opera and cinema, they are virtually unknown in musicological scholarship.</p>
<p>Drawing on extensive research in the Archivio Storico Ricordi, this paper examines the music publisher’s earliest such collaboration, that with Film d’Arte Italiana in 1911. This partnership resulted in a radically shortened adaptation of <em>Aida</em> roughly fifteen minutes long, one version of which still survives in various archival copies. Notwithstanding its brevity, Film d’Arte Italiana’s <em>Aida</em> was tied to Verdi’s opera—and, strikingly, to its original staging manual (<em>disposizione scenica</em>)—on both visual and dramatic levels. Additionally, many of its divergences from the original opera were made to accommodate the cinematic format, both in terms of its constraints as well as in the opportunities it afforded. As a rare surviving artifact, the 1911 <em>Aida</em> provides an exceptional opportunity to consider not only the resulting material products born of this collaboration across two industries but also the rationale behind the changes made to the structure, plot, and music in adapting the opera to the screen. Ultimately, this historical endeavor represents an alternative model for early twentieth-century perceptions of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, one informed by material and institutional histories and challenging assumptions about opera’s unilateral influence on cinema.</p>

<p class="abs-title">As Seen on TV: Putting the NBC Opera Theatre on Stage</p>
<p class="abs-author">Danielle Ward-Griffin (Christopher Newport University)</p>

<p>Best known for Gian Carlo Menotti’s <em>Amahl and the Night Visitors</em>, the NBC Opera introduced millions of Americans to English-language television versions of new and old operas from 1949 to 1964. According to conductor Peter Herman Adler, the program not only aimed to broaden the audience for opera but also to “restore its theatrical values” in a new media landscape. While scholars such as Barnes (2003), Citron (2000), and Rose (1986) have focused on the ways in which television brought opera to mass audiences, few have described the ways in which this new medium was intended to reinvigorate the stage. Rather than treat television opera separately from live performance, this paper situates the NBC Opera’s production techniques within a broader effort to reform operatic practices in America in the 1950s and ’60s. To this end, I focus on the NBC’s short-lived touring arm, which brought live, stage performances of television productions of <em>Madam Butterfly</em>, <em>The Marriage of Figaro,</em> and <em>La Traviata</em> to communities across America (1956–57). Drawing upon the NBC History Files, television kinescopes, and photographs and accounts of the stage productions, this paper traces how these small-scale opera performances were recalibrated to suit a television-watching public. Instead of relying on the stylized presentation and grand operatic gestures common at major opera houses, the NBC performances blended intimate television aesthetics with Broadway typecasting and naturalistic direction. Fostering an aesthetic that Elise K. Kirk has coined the “new American verismo,” this performance style became a principal export of the NBC Opera as the troupe conducted college workshops and influenced productions of the New York City Opera. Beyond the NBC, this paper tells a new story of opera performance in the United States, one in which the production style of early television opera did not simply respond to the exigencies of the screen, but also sought to transform the stage into a more intimate and supposedly more accessible site in the mid-twentieth century.</p>
