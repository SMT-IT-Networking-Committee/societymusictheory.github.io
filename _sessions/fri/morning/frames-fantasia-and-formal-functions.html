<p class="abs-title">Mendelssohn’s Formal Frames: Multi-Stage and Recurring Introductions</p>
<p class="abs-author">Catrina S. Kim (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>Taking their cue from Beethoven, Romantic composers habitually effaced the boundary between the framing device and the genuinely formal—Felix Mendelssohn’s op. 13 string quartet exemplifies this ambiguity through its multiple failed attempts to begin. But while the <em>multi-stage</em> introduction blurs initial boundaries between “before-the-beginning” and “beginning,” it does not necessarily disrupt the formal processes of the rest of the generic sonata. The <em>recurrence</em> of an introduction invariably does: with each intrusion into the sonata, it loses its essential quality of “preparation” while gaining thematic status. While the introduction to Mendelssohn’s op. 13 recurs only once in the coda to the final movement, his concert overtures often involve both multi-sectional introductions and highly disruptive recurrences.</p>
<p>I analyze three of these works, <em>Ein Sommernachtstraum</em>, op. 21<em>, Die schöne Melusine</em>, op. 32, and <em>Athalie</em>, op. 74, from the perspectives of Hepokoski and Darcy’s Sonata Theory (2006) and Caplin’s theory of classical form (1998), as well as Schmalfeldt’s (2011) and Martin &amp; Vande Moortele’s (2014) specifically <em>Romantic</em> formal concepts. Several commonalities emerge. First, the introduction recurs just prior to the recapitulation, while some portion of the primary theme fails to appear; in some cases, this strategy poses the possibility that the introduction becomes so formally involved that it <em>replaces</em> the primary theme. Second, <em>Ein Sommernachtstraum</em> and <em>Athalie</em> employ codas that reorder their multiple introductory modules. Mendelssohn’s reimagining of the introduction thus results in formal structures that simultaneously depend upon and resist the sonata’s orderdependent principle of rotation.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Thematic Design and Tonal Structure in the Viennese String Quartet Minuet, circa 1770: Haydn and the <em>Kleinmeister</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Christopher Brody (Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester)</p>

<p>The outward simplicity of the late-eighteenth-century minuet and trio has led scholars to underestimate both the structural diversity of the repertoire and the atypicality of examples by the most ambitious composers. Yet even while exaggerating the repertoire’s self-consistency, analysts disagree on fundamental questions about Classical two-reprise movements, such as whether thematic design or tonal structure is the more form-defining structural dimension. This paper addresses these challenges with a snapshot of the minuet and trio in a specific time, place, and genre: the Viennese string quartet in the years immediately surrounding 1770. I present a modest corpus study of the minuets and trios in thirty-six string quartets (seventy-two movements) written between 1769 and 1777 by the Viennese composers Asplmayr, Haydn, Vanhal, and Ordonez, coding each piece with a tonal structure and a thematic design.</p>
<p>In the works of the three <em>Kleinmeister</em>, the corpus study shows that even such similar composers conceived of minuet form differently. For example, Ordonez uses a particular tonal structure as the main required element, while thematic design may vary; Vanhal treats both elements with equal strictness, suggesting that the <em>conjunction</em> of structural dimensions was fundamental for him. Most flexible of all is Haydn, who combines structural possibilities with a freer hand than his Viennese contemporaries, also devising some <em>sui generis</em> thematic designs that make reference to standard plans while rejecting their strictures. Haydn’s achievement in even these brief works gains depth and texture when seen against the backdrop of local conventions.</p>

<p class="abs-title">The <em>Four-Key</em> Exposition? Schubert’s Sonata Forms, the Fantasia, and Questions of Formal Coherence</p>
<p class="abs-author">René Rusch (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>Among the scholarship on Schubert’s approach to sonata form are brief references to movements that appear to contain a <em>four-key</em> exposition. That the very notion of a four-key exposition has not been pursued beyond the modest attention afforded to footnotes and short paragraphs suggests that the idea is peripheral to our understanding of Schubert’s sonata forms, if not questionable under the rubric of certain <em>Formenlehre</em> theories.</p>
<p>This paper revisits one of these formal outliers, Schubert’s Piano Sonata in B major, D575, i (1817), and considers what we can gain by bringing sonata form into dialogue with the <em>fantasia</em>—a genre and musical aesthetic that resurfaced in late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century compositional thought. I explore the musical relationships that emerge from this cross-point and contemplate how such a perspective can affect the ways in which we think about formal coherence. Here I suggest that the fantasia functions as a loosening device, lending a sense of unpredictability to the B-major exposition’s thematic treatment and tonal trajectory. In particular, I discuss how the fantasia (1) invites development in the form of thematic variations, unraveling the tight-knit design characteristic of sonata-form expositions in relation to their development sections; (2) motivates modulations to several key areas, enabling key relations to obtain multiple meanings; (3) brings to the fore the heuristic devices used to make sense of a work’s structure by breaking a formal system’s set of expectations. My paper concludes by considering how these ideas can enrich our understanding and hearing of select three-key expositions.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Diverging Subordinate Themes and Internal Transitions: Assessing Internal Modulations in Three-Key Expositions</p>
<p class="abs-author">Graham G. Hunt (University of Texas at Arlington)</p>

<p>Recent scholarship on the so-called “three-key exposition” has drawn attention to its historical evolution, Schenkerian voice-leading considerations, and issues with cadences and internal “crises” in Schubert’s three-key expositions. Still to be examined in detail is one simple, yet fundamental, question: How and where do composers get from the second key to the third key? Using William Caplin’s formal functions to help categorize these internal modulations, this paper will assess interharmonic strategies in these unique expositional layouts.</p>
<p>The corpus examined comprises three-key expositions from the late eighteenth- and nineteenth century, by composers including Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Tchaikovsky. Categories for second to third key techniques are outlined based on where, in terms of formal functions (presentation, continuation, cadential, or framing), the divergence/modulation occurs within the relevant subordinate theme. Examples of these techniques include the Internal Transition, Block/Abrupt Modulation, Continuation=&gt;Internal Transition, and the False Subordinate Theme. Once these categories are established, we can then consider questions such as: Does the type of cadence before an Internal Transition affect its transitional nature? What “loosening” techniques are employed in Deviating Subordinate Themes? Also, does Schubert’s oft-discussed usage of PAC’s to <em>begin</em> subordinate themes necessitate a re-consideration of Caplin’s axiom that transitions cannot conclude with a PAC? This crucial consideration, as well as other possible adjustments to Caplin’s theory, becomes relevant when examining more complex nineteenth-century three-key expositions. This adaptability, in turn, speaks to the benefits of applying Formal-Function Theory to works written in the richer formal and harmonic style of the nineteenth century.</p>
