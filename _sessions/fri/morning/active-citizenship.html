<p>Many academics find that contemporary social and political issues impact
our professional lives.  Whether our concerns are for the rights of a
particular student or colleague or more broadly for the principles of
inclusivity and equity, many SMT and AMS members feel increasingly compelled
to speak up for those who have less power or privilege.  Despite our
motivation, however, we sometimes find ourselves lacking the skills and
experience to be effective advocates.</p>

<p>This special session provides practical advice and strategies to champion
the causes we support.  Our featured speakers have extensive experience as
advocates, and they will suggest opportunities to promote a cause, recommend
ways to inspire action, and explain how to deliver the same message
differently in order to persuade politicians with divergent perspectives.
Time will be reserved for audience participation and questions.</p>
