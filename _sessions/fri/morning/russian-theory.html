<p class="abs-title">Interrelation of Modality and Tonality in the Theoretical
  Concepts of Harold Powers and Yury Kholopov</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sergey Lebedev (Moscow Tchaikovski Conservatory)</p>

<p>Harold Powers, in a number of his publications (beginning in 1981), argued that modality and tonality coexisted as musical properties on separate epistemological planes; therefore, it is meaningless to imagine a transition from one to the other. Modality and tonality, in this sense, are no longer competing or mutually exclusive means of tonal organization. At the same time, independently of Powers, a similar concept was elaborated by Yury Kholopov. He argued (first in 1982) that modality and tonality are not opposites, like consonance and dissonance, but rather heterogeneous tonal systems. This is why they do not contradict each other and may produce “any number of mixed and interrelated tonal structures” (Russian: <i>lad—</i>that is, mode<i>—</i>of mixed type, or, in my own terminology, <i>amphitrope</i>). While Powers offered his unorthodox theory as a contribution to the long-standing polemics (which involved Carl Dahlhaus and Bernhard Meier) on the transition from Renaissance modal polyphony to the harmonic tonality of the Baroque era, Kholopov considered his concept globally relevant and applied it to virtually any kind of music, both Western and Eastern, early (e.g. Western plainchant and <i>obikhod</i> modes of Old-Russian chant) and modern (e.g., so called modalisms in Romantic music, symmetrical modes of the twentieth century, including octatonic). In this paper, I will demonstrate points of both contact and divergence in the theories of the two prominent scholars, both of whom strove to overcome the conventional ‘dichotomic’ treatment of tonality and modality.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Yuri Kholopov’s Concept of Evolution of Tonal Harmony</p>
<p class="abs-author">Grigorii Lyzhov (Moscow Tchaikovski Conservatory)</p>

<p>Yury Kholopov (1932-2003), a prominent theorist and professor at the Moscow Conservatory, was a proponent of seamless integration of the twentieth-century music into the general paradigm of the evolution of harmony. Chronologically, Kholopov’s concept begins with the new harmony of the late-Romantic music. These “new techniques of Romantic harmony” include three groups. The first group refers to the category of chord; the second, scale; and the third, tonal structure as a whole.</p>
<p>The first group presents new normative textures that exceed the classical notions of chord and chord progression, such as “elaboration of a chord,” “sonant coloristic,” “functional inversion,” “mono-structural rows,” “technique of the intervallic non-variable” and “the functions of tritone substitutions.” The second group is related to the expansion of scales beyond the derivation from major and minor. The role of these new scales becomes more and more important for the pitch system of the whole, a role manifested in new modal techniques (expressed in the introduction of natural and artificial modes).</p>
<p>The third group—tonal structure as a whole—includes ten terms, all of which represent <i>states of tonality</i> (a table of ten states that describe specific, non-classical, relationships between the center and periphery of a tonal system).</p>
<p>This conceptual system, offered by Kholopov, has become the core method of current Russian pedagogy and research on tonal harmony of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Harmony as the Tool for Developing Spatial Faculty in
  Students at the Pre-Conseratory Level in Russia</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lota Dzhumanova (Moscow Tchaikovski Conservatory)</p>

<p>Russian understanding of harmony is not reducible to Riemann’s three functions alone. Yury Tjulin’s concept of the intermittent function and Yury Kholopov’s idea of harmony beyond the common-practice era have allowed Russian theorists to address issues of harmony far beyond the simplistic fundamental bass method. Their ideas led to the development of advanced spatial orientation in students’ musical thinking at the pre-conservatory level.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is quite exciting to observe similar tendencies in Western theoretical thought, for instance in the works of David Lewin, Richard Cohn and Dmitri Tymoczko. Their intentions to broaden Riemann’s functional theory, and to expand both the depth and the breadth of the understanding of function resonate with similar ideas of contemporary Russian theorists. A distinctive feature of contemporary Western tradition is the search for three-dimensional spatial principles of extended tonality. The same aspect has been crucial in research and pedagogy in Russia in the past decade. However, as opposed to Neo-Riemannian geometrical structures and Lewin’s transformational approach, Russian theorists have developed a spatial model that allows one to move from major and minor towards modal mixture and to expand the diatonic structure by chromatic means. And at this level, the idea of chromatization resonates with Richard Cohn’s notion of chromatic harmony based upon the logic of parsimonious voice leading of the consonant triad.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Tjulin, Kushnarev, Bershadskaya: Leningrad School of Music
  Theory in a Dialogue with Schenker’s and Lehrdal’s Ideas</p>
<p class="abs-author">Daniil Shutko (St. Petersburg Rimski-Korsakov Conservatory)</p>

<p>As opposed to the Moscow school of music theory, the Leningrad (St. Petersburg) school concentrates on the human dimension more than it does on the musical text. Even such an abstract concept as the harmonic function receives a dynamic reinterpretation with the Leningrad theorists: instead of the clear-cut T-S-D-T model, Yury Tjulin discusses <i>intermittent functions</i>, i.e., functions that change their meaning as the linear intervallic material unfolds.</p>
<p>The Russian indigenous term <i>lad</i> (mode) was elaborated by Tjulin and Tatiana Bershadskaya. <i>Lad </i>is a category of human consciousness; it is a hierarchical scale of meanings that is formed as a result of generalization of the sounding material. This approach is close to Fred Lehrdal’s concept of hierarchy and function. Bershadskaya criticizes the limited acoustic explanations of tonal function. Khristophor Kushnarev (1956) suggested a unique contribution for the expansion of tonal function as a concept. Kushnarev has demonstrated that a single tone, unsupported by a chord, has the capacity of carrying a full-scale <i>lad</i> function (tonal function), albeit different in the degree of tension between dominant and subdominant.</p>
<p>Music theory as a unified system of concepts, which Leningrad theorists often call a “hypersystem,” consists of several subsystems, such as metro-rhythm, texture, mode (including questions of harmony), thematicism, and form. In this sense, the Leningrad school seems to be closer to the Schenkerian position (priority of dynamic, process-like, linear dimension over the structural schematic abstractions and hierarchical thinking), than either to the Moscow school or to the continental tradition of <i>Funktionslehre</i>.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Boris Asafyev, Intonation Theory and Analysis of Atonal
  Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Tatiana Tsaregradskaya (Gnesins Russian Academy of Music)</p>

<p>David Damschroder and David Russel Williams (1990) call Boris Asafiev “one of the most influential scholars in Soviet music theory.” Asafiev’s contributions fall into three categories: 1) musical intonation (<i>intonatsia</i>) as a socially determined phenomenon; 2) musical form as a process; and 3) mode and harmony as manifestations of <i>intonatsia</i>. Although the term <i>intonatsia</i> lacks precise translation into English, it has been used as <i>intonation</i> in the works of Nigel Osborne (1986) and Raymond Monelle (1992).</p>
<p>The theory of musical intonation has its origin in speech intonation, which becomes transformed into musical intonation through the intervallic principle. The interval is considered to be “the precise determinant of the emotionally meaningful quality of intonation” (Asafiev, <i>Musical Form as a Process</i>). This method also proved to be productive with respect to atonal music. The significance of intervallic relations in the music of Anton Webern lends itself to intonational analysis. Asafiev never analyzed Webern, yet his successor Victor Bobrovsky (1978) used intonation theory in an analysis of Webern’s op. 5, no.4. The result can be compared to Allen Forte’s (1964) analysis of the same piece.</p>
<p>A comparison of the two analyses makes it possible to implement Nattiez’s typology of analytical approaches (1998). Bobrovsky’s approach can be put into the category of “semantically oriented analysis,” while Forte’s would be labeled as taxonomic. It is also possible to consider both analyses as complementary, not contradictory, since they describe different aspects of the musical substance.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Methods of Chord Notation Compared: Figured Bass, Roman
  Numeral, Functional Theory, and Igor Sposobin’s Hybrid System in their
  Capacity to Reflect Linear Coherence in Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ildar Khannanov (Peabody Conservatory)</p>

<p>All three major systems—figured bass, scale step theory and functional theory—have deficiencies when it comes to representation of the linear coherence of a musical work. As a successor of counterpoint theories, figured bass has certain advantages over the simplified fundamental bass concept. Yet, the convoluted explanation of an enormous number of sonorities and their connections in figured bass treatises expedited the transition to a new functional system that offered a tight-knit theoretical explanation of the chordal structure. However, this system was immediately accused of operating solely with verticalities and lacking a sense of horizontal unfolding. Viennese scale-step theory simply marked the position of the roots within a scale with the Roman numerals and retreated from any attempts to explain linear tendencies among chords. As an alternative, Igor Sposobin, in 1934, introduced a hybrid system. He managed to solve the problems of the three preceding traditions by retaining both the Roman numeral notation and the functional letter markings within the chord symbols, so that a student could identify a potential goal of resolution.</p>
<p>Of course, this discussion falls short of Schenker’s view of the structure as a whole. However, in his theory, the events at local levels replicate themselves at higher levels, and the system in its entirety depends on the structure and analytical notation of its smallest elements.</p>
