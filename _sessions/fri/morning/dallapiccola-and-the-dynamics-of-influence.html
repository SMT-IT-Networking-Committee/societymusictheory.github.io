<p class="abs-title">The Composer and his Advocate: Taking Clues from the Dallapiccola-Mila Correspondence for an Analysis of <em>Tre Poemi</em> (1949)</p>

<p>Music critic and advocate of the avant-garde Massimo Mila (1910–88) corresponded intensively with Luigi Dallapiccola from 1933 until the composer’s death in 1975 (Dallapiccola/Mila 2005). A central topic in their letters from the 1940s is Dallapiccola’s adoption of twelve-tone technique. These letters bring to light, on one side, a critic with his modernist/left-leaning agenda trying to gain a clearer understanding of twelve-tone composition and, on the other side, a composer explaining and justifying his own continuing evolution as dodecaphonist. While the letters never go into fine details of compositional technique itself, at a crucial point in his development as twelve-tone composer in 1949 Dallapiccola sends Mila, at the latter’s request, a sketch manuscript of a short score for <em>Tre Poemi</em> for voice and chamber orchestra with a partial serial analysis.</p>
<p>This paper takes this source, which was recently discovered in Mila’s manuscript collection, in conjunction with a close reading of the Dallapiccola-Mila correspondence, the articles published by each of them around the time, and Dallapiccola’s sketches for other works as point of departure for an analysis of <em>Tre Poemi</em> that illuminates Dallapiccola’s core concerns as twelve-tone composer at this juncture of his career. Our analysis provides the musical background against which to read the Dallapiccola-Mila correspondence from the mid-century—a time when, by associating himself with Mila, the only prominent Italian critic untainted by fascism, Dallapiccola seemed intent on erasing the traces of his own past links to the Mussolini regime (Alberti 2013).</p>


<p class="abs-title">Teaching Beyond the Craft of Composition: The Relationship between Luigi Dallapiccola and Luciano Berio</p>

<p>In 1952 Luciano Berio spent eight weeks at the Berkshire Festival (Tanglewood) to attend composition lessons with Luigi Dallapiccola. Immediately following this encounter, the two discussed the work of James Joyce, the writer about whom Dallapiccola had already written in 1951, illustrating the musical aspects of Joyce’s prose. Berio’s tape composition <em>Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)</em> (1958) was one of the outcomes of his reading of Dallapiccola’s article. Dallapiccola was both the intellectual with whom Berio shared his interest in quoting from different literary texts and the teacher to whom he would submit his analyses. In light of this close affinity between master and student it may come as a surprise that Berio ultimately distanced himself from Dallapiccola, disapproving of the latter’s dodecaphonic language focused on strict counterpoint.</p>
<p>While Berio rejected the pristine twelve-tone canons typical of Dallapiccola’s music, he took their principles and developed them further, in ways that are harder to recognize on the musical surface. Berio carried canonic thinking into other dimensions. These include: rhythmic and <em>Klangfarben</em>-canons on a fixed pitch rather than involving moving melodies, and phonetic canons based on an analysis of “vocal colors” in the prose of Joyce.</p>
<p>In spite of his critical behavior towards the master, Berio recognized Dallapiccola as the central figure who brought younger Italian composers in closer contact with twelve-tone technique at a time when the cultural repression of Fascism was still alive.</p>
