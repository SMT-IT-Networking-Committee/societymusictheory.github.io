<p>Scholars have long been dismissive of the viability of long-range tonal organization in film music, but few scholars have actually undertaken this type of analysis. Current scholarship defines tonal design as an “overarching, hierarchical, and teleological tonal plan” (Neumeyer 1998) that delineates how keys are employed and deployed across a whole film. I will demonstrate the practicability of tonal design in film by presenting <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i> (1999) as a case study. My analysis will show that a narrative-based tonal scheme governs the entire music track of the film.</p>
<p>At the heart of the music track is a dynamic network of leitmotifs in D minor, the key associated with Tom Ripley’s despair. The significance of this key emanates from a crucial narrative moment during which a Tchaikovsky excerpt unfurls the D-minor kernel at the precise midpoint of the film. The secondary key area of F Major represents the narratival antipode of D minor, accompanying Ripley’s moments of optimism. These (and other) key areas interact with one another in nuanced ways to contribute to the narrative.</p>
<p>The intentionality of the tonal design in this film is corroborated by two factors. Firstly, certain cues are transposed to different keys, which enables us to differentiate between tonal and thematic function. Secondly, the fact that the <i>preexisting</i> musical works also adhere to the overarching tonal scheme bespeaks deliberate planning.</p>
<p>My analytical approach engages both esthesic and poietic perspectives, and I will illustrate the productivity of its application to other films.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Large-Scale Dramatic Irony in Carter Burwell’s Score to <i>Barton Fink</i></p>

<p>The notoriously problematic narrative of Joel and Ethan Coen’s Barton Fink has inspired numerous interpretations that attempt to synthesize the film’s rich web of symbolism. Most approaches reject the film’s overt meaning and instead filter its events through various hermeneutic lenses. Though these lenses enrich filmic interpretation, they neglect the importance of Carter Burwell’s sparse score, which, when understood in its narrative context, reveals a sense of large-scale dramatic irony to the viewer that solicits sympathy for Barton’s plight. This paper demonstrates how this irony is achieved through an examination of its cumulative form and directional tonal structure while contradicting assertions that the film aims to make a mockery of its protagonist.</p>
<p>While Burwell’s score includes less than 25 minutes of music, it charts a single course through Barton’s tortured creative process in the face of a debilitating case of writer’s block. To illustrate, I will showcase the use of music across the film’s complete structure using a Narrative/Dramatic Structure Diagram (a synthesis of concepts from Seymour Chatman and Gustav Freytag). The score’s directional tonality conveys a sense of large-scale dramatic irony because its modulation from Bb major to G minor informs the audience that Barton’s manuscript will not achieve success, even though Barton continues to believe it will until his boss rejects the script outright.</p>
<p>Contrary to existing readings of the film, I demonstrate that Burwell’s score provides an alternate and sympathetic understanding of Barton’s struggle to create a screenplay that meets his uncompromising standard of artistic integrity.</p>
