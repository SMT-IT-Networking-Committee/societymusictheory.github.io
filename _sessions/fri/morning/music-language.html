<p class="abs-title">Are There Movement Transformations in Musical Grammar?</p>
<p class="abs-author">Sam Mukherji (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>In the age-old search for music-language connections, an unresolved issue is whether music has <i>movement transformations </i>like language. Linguists, especially within the generative, “Chomskyan” tradition, treat transformations as crucial components of language, because of their role in describing how diverse “surface” (e.g. the declarative and interrogative, or active and passive) forms of a sentence are <i>generated</i> from common “deep” structures – so much so that generative linguists describe their theory of language as being a <i>transformational generative grammar </i>of language. In contrast, the idea that music might have a transformational grammar has been questioned, even by generative approaches in music theory, such as that of Lerdahl and Jackendoff. This paper will argue, however, that music <i>does</i> have movement transformations – because of how they are implicit, strikingly, in Heinrich Schenker’s description of interruptions. Traditionally, Schenker’s analyses of interrupted forms have been considered one of the weaker aspects of his theory of tonality. This paper’s contention is that such perceived weaknesses can be explained away easily, as long as one conceives interruptions, and tonal structure in general, in transformational terms, as Schenker seems to have done implicitly himself. Not only does this justify Schenker’s own treatment of interruptions, it also strengthens the possibility that music and language, and Schenkerian music theory and Chomskyan linguistics, share a deep connection – and are perhaps identical. Therefore, the paper ends with an examination of this provocative suggestion, and what this implies for future work in “musicolinguistic” theory.</p>

<p>Since Herzog (1934), researchers have compared speech contour and song melody. Fewer studies have addressed the influence of linguistic tone on vocal polyphony. Recent findings on tone perception in Ìgbò and Yorùbá are consistent with writings by Èkwúèmé (1972). Speech tones are not fixed but form contrastive relationships with temporally-adjacent and non-adjacent tones accommodating different voice ranges and changes in arousal.</p>
<p>Speech-tone contrasts (tonemes) in Niger-Congo languages share features of contour (+, 0, -) and pitch interval with melody. However, toneme magnitude is not discrete (e.g. M3, P4) but proximal like conjunct and disjunct motion. Intonation allows for repetition of text transposed within the same voice or to another part, with flexibility for in-exact imitation. However, melodic transformations often disfigure linguistic contour. Setting identical text to different contours or different text to identical melody is highly problematic. Contrary motion and strophic setting rarely occur indigenously or in post-colonial choral music (Euba 2001).</p>
<p>A foundational rule for voice-leading in Niger-Congo vocal music emerges: across syllable and word boundaries intervals should reflect tonemes, but not between phrases, normalizing meta-intonational transposition. In the sequence L.H||L.H||L.H|| each “Low” could be a different pitch, even above the preceding “High” while still satisfying the rule. As with other voice-leading prescriptions, this rule reflects idealized practice. As Agawu (1988) and others have noted, not all words have tone variants and context can clarify meaning. However, following tonemic contour is emphasized in many sectors of Nigerian musical practice. Scores and field recordings are analyzed manually and using a MATLAB implementation.</p>
