<p class="abs-title">Reconstructing the <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em> Piano Solo</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ryan Raul Bañagale (Colorado College)</p>

<p>Recent scholarship on <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em> examines the collaborative process between George Gershwin and arranger Ferde Grofé as they prepared the piece for its premiere at Paul Whiteman’s “Experiment in Modern Music” on 12 February 1924. It places significant emphasis on Grofé’s role in selecting and shaping the overall “sound” of the original orchestral arrangement of the <em>Rhapsody</em> as he prepared Gershwin’s two-piano short score for the instrumental forces of the Whiteman ensemble. But despite the <em>Rhapsody</em>’s status as a piece for solo piano and ensemble, the genesis of the piano part—arguably the most central component of its sound—has been neglected.</p>
<p>In this paper, I use the three original manuscript documents—Gershwin’s holograph short score, a fair-copy document, and Grofé’s completed orchestration—to raise significant new questions about what, exactly, Gershwin played at the 1924 premiere and how this connects to the legacy of the piece. It is worth asking whether the piano score hastily published in the wake of the work’s successful debut—and continuously performed for the past ninety years—accurately represents Gershwin’s initial intentions. Thirty measures of non-published piano solo exist in these manuscripts. Additionally, Gershwin’s holograph becomes increasingly sketchy in the final third of the piece due to the time constraints under which he operated, with passages remaining completely un-notated. Drawing on new details regarding the chronology of the creative process, it becomes possible to establish what portions of the piano part had been written prior to the premiere and what may have been added—or removed—at a subsequent point in time. The process of reconstructing the original piano solo provides new evidence against the long-held belief that Gershwin improvised portions of the <em>Rhapsody</em> during the premiere performance. It also illuminates some of the more experimental tendencies of Gershwin’s approach to the piano, which align with the modernist approach of his New York City contemporaries to a greater extent than typically allowed.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Dancing in the Barn with Charles Ives</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jacob A. Cohen (Graduate Center, CUNY)</p>

<p>In a 2006 essay, John McGinness criticized what he deemed the “modernist agenda” of Ives scholarship that focused on compositional craft and formalism to legitimize Ives’s perceived amateurism. Yet recent scholars such as Gayle Sherwood Magee, J. Peter Burkholder, and Joseph Horowitz have bucked this trend; their critical approaches consider the extra-musical associations of melodies and styles in order to fully understand Ives’s complex negotiation of his historical and cultural identity. However, these studies have not fully addressed how Ives’s music and stylistic topics illuminate his tensions about geographical identity, a crucial element for a composer who so often articulates place in his music.</p>
<p>This paper examines the barn dance, a style that has not yet been treated as a distinct semiotic topic in Ives scholarship, and what Ives’s use of barn dance melodies reveals about his experience of New England culture and geography. As a man physically and spiritually caught between city and country, Ives mirrored his own complicated geographic identity in pieces such as <em>Washington’s Birthday</em> and the Second Violin Sonata, mediating the urban (high culture instrumental genres) with the rural (folk barn dances). This place-based understanding therefore illuminates Ives’s changing perception of urban and rural geography around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Using firsthand accounts of barn dance traditions at various points in New England history in diaries, memoirs, popular magazines, and other primary sources, I illustrate how Ives reconciled contemporaneous twentieth-century attitudes towards this social dance with his own nostalgic construction of nineteenth-century life. Additionally, Ives’s commingling of folk and high art elements—for example, his quotation of melodies with their own cultural histories and social meanings, his conscious use of the genre “sonata,” and his audacious use of the Jew’s harp in the symphonic <em>Washington’s Birthday</em>—became a political statement, subverting the Gilded Age value system that privileged the cultivated tradition. In these two compositions, the barn dance simultaneously served as nostalgia for a nineteenth-century folk tradition and acted as a foil to what Ives perceived as the effeminacy of genteel society in America.</p>
