<p>Empirical approaches to music research have become more prominent in recent decades, offering the field of music theory new tools to complement existing theoretical methodologies, which may or may not include computational resources (including Humdrum and music21). While many scholars might have the desire to engage with these empirical or computational tools, it can be difficult to know where to begin. This workshop is intended to provide an introduction to empirical methods in music theory through the use of an accessible series of research questions, discussions of how and when empirical methods are appropriate, and an exploration of ways to avoid potential methodological pitfalls in empirical music research.</p>
<p>This session will be a combination of panel discussion and workshop, roughly divided into five components: (1) An introduction of various empirical methods and computational tools, including a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses; (2) An overview of the process whereby a research question is crystalized into a testable hypothesis and appropriate methods chosen by which that hypothesis can be tested; (3) An interactive research workshop in which a specific musical hypothesis will be tested during the session; (4) A brief survey of common statistical methods and a demonstration of the testing of the workshop hypothesis; and (5) A question and answer session.</p>
