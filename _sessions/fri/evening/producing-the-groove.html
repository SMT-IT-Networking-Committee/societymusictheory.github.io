<p class="abs-title">The Backbeat as Expressive Device in Popular Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nathan Hesselink (University of British Columbia)</p>

<p>The backbeat remains the most common and distinctive rhythmic feature of post-1950’s popular music. Its ubiquity and simplicity perhaps accounts for why analysts tend to relegate the backbeat to a purely time-keeping role, and why variations in its employment and the resultant meanings that have accrued over multiple decades and genres have been overlooked. This presentation serves as a counter-narrative to this trend, offering four case studies in which the backbeat is used as an expressive device: 1) to achieve clarification and resolution (Thom Yorke’s “A Brain in a Bottle,” 2014); 2) to create a sense of play, fun, and/or deviance (The Cars’ “Just What I Needed,” 1978); 3) to create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty (Rush’s “Limelight,” 1981); and 4) to simultaneously provide clarification and ambiguity (Led Zeppelin’s “Dazed and Confused,” 1969). Both as rhythmic place keeper and as expressive device, the backbeat is a central element in audiences’ understanding of popular music, particularly groove- and/or dance-based genres. This research provides further evidence of the connections made by music theorists and cognitive scientists between metrical prediction, entrainment, embodiment, listener participation, and meaning. The composers and performers of the works presented here clearly understood this potential to reinforce, thwart, and/or enhance listener’s expectations, and thus bolster the expressive power of music.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Off the Grid: Self-Effacing Production in Electronic Dance Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Michael D’Errico (Pitzer College)</p>

<p>The history of electronic dance music is littered with machines. Canonic devices such as the Akai MPC sampler, the Technics SL-1200 turntables, and the Roland TR-808 and 909 drum machines have helped to define entire subgenres, while mobilizing communities of practice both in the studio and on the dance floor. At the same time, just as these devices become enmeshed in the histories and practices of the music, their techniques often become transparent to the community, fading into the background of dancers’ minds and producers’ computer screens. Other times, producers and audiences seem to efface the machines entirely, focusing their creative attention instead on affectively manipulating physical bodies on the dance floor. What happens to the visceral experience of electronic dance music in the perceived absence of technology? Or, is it simply the case that the proliferation of machines in dance music has fundamentally reconfigured the listener’s experience of his or her own technological body?</p>
<p>Combining musical analysis with the online discourse of DJs, producers, and critics, this paper focuses on the curious case of Chicago footwork—a style that appears to both celebrate and mask its technical underpinnings. Expanding on the concept of the “self-effacing producer” (Jarrett 2012), I argue that footwork DJs achieve their affective impact by masking the technical apparatus of their production through complex forms of rhythmic and metric modulation, thus heightening the sense of physicality and presence in both DJs and dancers. While many of their musical techniques seem to highlight mediation processes—complex rhythmic quantization, microsampling, metric and temporal modulation—footwork producers instead align these techniques with physical cues from the dancers, intensified by sexually explicit samples calling attention to the body in motion. By detailing the musical and social displacement of technological objects in an otherwise technologically pervasive genre, this paper offers new methods and perspectives on the integrated embodied practices of dance, music, and human-computer interaction (HCI).</p>

<p class="abs-title">(Dys)Functional Harmony: How Sound Production in Twenty-First Century Pop Music Liberates Harmony from its Functional Role</p>
<p class="abs-author">Asaf Peres (Ann Arbor, Michigan)</p>

<p>Commercial pop music in the past decade is largely characterized by two major developments. The first is the emergence of sound production techniques as determinants of syntax. Manipulations of sonic density and gestures such as filter sweeps and drum intensification have taken a lead role in delineating form and creating tension and release. The second is the evolution of tonality to significantly diminish and sometimes completely exclude the use of anticipatory mechanisms upon which tonal syntax traditionally relies. These two developments occurred simultaneously—as sound production became more dominant, the use of cadential progressions, dissonant sonorities, and chromaticism has steadily declined. In essence, one set of syntactical tools replaced another, while retaining the latter’s fundamental objects (e.g., diatonic triads, tonal centers).</p>
<p>The syntactical dominance of sound production has allowed songwriters to use unusual chord progressions that constitute a significant shift from past popular music genres. For instance, while I and V were key ingredients in almost every chord progression in twentieth century rock and pop, at least one of those is omitted in many contemporary pop songs, whose progressions often begin and/or end with chords traditionally associated with the predominant function. Arrival points are almost never resting points, with songs even ending on open-ended gestures, and rarely on the tonic. These developments are examined in this paper through analyses of recently released pop songs, and are visualized by a combination of traditional notation, spectrograms, and form timelines.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Groove, Timbre, and the Metaphor of Weight</p>
<p class="abs-author">Chris McDonald (Cape Breton University)</p>

<p>There is no question that creation and perception of “groove” involves aspects of both timing and of timbre. This presentation explores timbre’s role in the creation of grooves, with attention to the metaphor of weight. When instruments, especially drums, are recorded or synthesized, the percussive sounds are often manipulated to resemble objects of varying amounts of weight. The manipulation of percussive sounds in recorded music can create a variety of weight-based kinesthetic associations, such as the “heaviness” of heavy metal, or the spry sense produced in some electronic dance music.</p>
<p>This presentation builds on Charles Keil’s hypothesis that rhythmic grooves depend on micro-timing to create certain rhythmic feels, and that such grooves are often described as “behind the beat” or “ahead” or “on top of the beat.” This distinction, for Keil, is the basis on which grooves create different kinesthetic effects for listeners or participants. This presentation hypothesizes that feelings of lag (“behind the beat”) and anticipation (“ahead of the beat”) may be partly an outcome of timbre, as well as micro-timing. Using selected recordings, I present a case that the heavier the percussion track sounds, the more “lag” is perceived, while the lighter the percussion sounds, the more it feels on top or ahead of the perceived beat. The connection between rhythm, timbre and perceived weight may have ramifications for discussing music’s effects, expression, and its placement within genres, so this connection is worth exploring in detail.</p>
