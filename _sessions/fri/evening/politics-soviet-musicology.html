<p>Methodological precepts of music scholarship in the Soviet Union changed
many times over the course of the seven decades of its existence. The rhetoric
in the humanities turned like a weather vane according to the ideological
climate. However, once adapted to these constraints, Soviet scholars created
novel methods and approaches, often fruitfully applying ideals of socially
engaged scholarship to the study of music, in dialogue with and antagonism to
the Western strands of musicology and music theory. Organized longitudinally,
this session offers a bird’s-eye view of the entire Soviet period. Starting
with the tightening of the ideological control during the Cultural Revolution
and up to the late- and post-Soviet “culturological turn,” its participants
trace the politics of producing knowledge about music in the Soviet Union. In
addition, the session also positions Soviet music scholarship in the global
context of the Cold War, analyzing exchanges between Soviet, American, and
East German scholars. </p>

<p>Philip Ewell examines a conference, convened in 1930 by the Minister of
Education Anatoly Lunacharsky, aimed at determining to what extent Boleslav
Yavorsky’s influential theory of modal rhythm “corresponded to the principles
of dialectical materialism.” At the conference, Nikolai Garbuzov attacked
modal rhythm’s acoustical basis, and Ivanov-Boretsky challenged it from a
historical angle, equating it with “impressionism” and “bourgeois” ideals.
Ultimately, Lunacharsky endorsed Yavorsky: “I am firmly convinced that it is
the theory most closely related to Marxism,” and the teaching of modal rhythm
was sanctioned. The talk will contextualize the politics of this conference.

<p>The search for a “Marxist theory of music” persisted well into the 1930s,
manifesting itself in a new analytical method called “holistic analysis”
(<i>tselostnïy analiz</i>), which aimed to consider musical structure,
content, and context symbiotically. Daniil Zavlunov explores holistic analysis
as an attempt to define and legitimize the discipline of music analysis itself
as a “scientific” and independent branch of Soviet “theoretical musicology.”
Surveying select writings of Lev Kulakovsky (1933), Viktor Tsukkerman (1936),
Iosif Ryzhkin (1939), and Leo Mazel’ (1940), he examines how this impulse took
the form of self-positioning, both positive and negative, in relation to
contemporaneous Soviet and Western music scholarship. </p>

<p>Between 1930 and 1970, the influential music journal <i>Sovetskaya
  muzïka</i> used the term “young composers” as a code condemning Soviet
composers who were experimenting with nontonality (Volkonsky, Denisov, and
Gubaidulina). Dmitri Kabalevsky was especially at the forefront of this
campaign and published several articles excoriating the creative liberties of
the “young composers” (1957, 1958, 1959). Inessa Bazayev explores the
continuing effect of such politics of condemnation on post-Soviet scholarship,
as can be seen in Yuri Kholopov’s essay (2000), which, exploring Roslavets’s
compositional system, cautiously calls it neotonal, tiptoeing around the
formerly forbidden terms of nontonal, atonal, and serial.</p>

<p>In 1942 Konstantin Kuznetsov sent a letter to Alfred Einstein through VOKS,
the Soviet cultural diplomacy agency. VOKS solicited hundreds of such letters
to the United States in an effort to build wartime solidarity. However,
Kuznetsov and Einstein’s exchange was far more topically substantial, as both
expressed genuine interest in further professional contact, but neither
followed up, which was typical for the VOKS correspondence. By reading this
correspondence as an example within the wider context of VOKS’s wartime work,
Matthew Honegger argues that political and organizational situations on both
sides turned the possibility of exchange of ideas between Soviet and American
musicologists into a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>As East German musicologists looked to Soviet scholarship in formulating
new theories of “objective musical content,” music teachers took up the task
of educating children to “consciously” understand this content. Borrowing from
Boris Asafyev’s concept of “intonation” (<i>intonatsiya</i>), East German
teachers asserted that content lay in the unity of text and melody because
even textless music derived meaning through speech-like tension and
resolution. Anicia Timberlake examines how the concept of “intonation” and its
attendant modes of musical experience were translated from theory into
practice, and from a Soviet to a German political context. </p>

<p>In the wake of the Lacy-Zarubin agreement of January 1958, an official
channel opened for academic exchange between the US and the USSR. Some six
dozen American musicologists and music theorists applied to IREX
(International Research and Exchange Board) for competitive fellowships to do
research in the Soviet Bloc. The successful applicants’ final reports preserve
their experiences navigating what was at the time a terra incognita for
American academics. Olga Panteleeva analyzes these impressions and critiques
of Soviet musicology, to reconstruct a view of music scholarship
(<i>muzïkovedeniye</i>) in the USSR through the eyes of young American
scholars—inevitably tinted by Cold War attitudes and inevitably political.</p>

<p>In “Who Invented Twelve-Tone Technique?” (1983), Yuri Kholopov
contextualized the development of Schoenberg’s dodecaphony among other
contemporaneous compositional trends, demonstrating how composers of the 1910s
to ’20s used serial technique (Stravinsky’s <i>Firebird</i>), referential
sonorities (Roslavets), twelve-tone series (Golïshev), and twelve-tone chords
(Obukhov, Prokofiev). Kholopov outlines an array of twelve-tone
<i>techniques</i>, decentering Schoenberg and accommodating several Russian
composers who, a generation earlier, would not have figured in the twelve-tone
historical narrative. Christopher Segall argues that twelve-tone theory is a
social and political construction, subject to negotiation. Kholopov’s expanded
definition of twelve-tone technique views serial dodecaphony within a broader
network of compositional concerns at a particular moment.</p>

<p>William Quillen’s paper explores the idea of “culturology”
(<i>kul’turologiya</i>) and its invocation in recent Russian-language music
scholarship. Based on the ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin, Aleksey Losev, and others,
culturology emerged as an academic discipline in the USSR in the 1960s and was
popularized throughout the 1980s. After the Soviet collapse, it was instituted
as a formal—and, often, compulsory—discipline in many of Russia’s leading
universities. With this popularization, culturology and its attendant ideas
have seen increasing use in music discourse, both as a way of understanding
individual pieces and, more broadly, a way of thinking, writing, and talking
about music-making.</p>
