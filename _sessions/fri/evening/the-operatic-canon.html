<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>While much has been written about how symphonies, sacred works, and chamber music remained in performance, little systematic effort has gone into determining the practical or aesthetic parameters of opera repertories, which were economically and culturally the most significant form of music-making during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These tended to have shorter lives than in concert culture; the tradition of what the French called <em>les progrès de la musique</em> would assert itself in complex and sometimes contradictory (e.g. in the case of grand opéra) ways.</p>
<p>The session will address this under-explored area, featuring speakers contributing to the forthcoming <em>Oxford Handbook of the Operatic Canon</em>, edited by William Weber and Cormac Newark. It grows out of a research network funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council to bring together interdisciplinary academic and industry thinkers (ranging from musicologists and historians to professional critics, funders, and adminstrators up to and including the Director of Opera at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden) to begin a conversation about the emergence, evolution, history, and future of the operatic canon.</p>
<p>The three-hour session comprises the chair’s introduction, five brief statements derived from historically and geographically or culturally specific case-studies, response, and moderated general discussion.</p>
<p>Chair James Parakilas is author of the chapter “The Operatic Canon” in the <em>Oxford Handbook of Opera</em>, an overview of the historical development (and cultural complexities) of many of the issues taken up and examined in more detail by the network. William Weber will discuss how scholars and journalists have been slow to confront this problem because opera has stood apart from classical-music life, failing to establish a comparable aesthetic. Katherine Hambridge will show how the performance of “old” operatic repertoire in early nineteenth-century Berlin was, rather than a measure of aesthetic or commercial success, part of a deliberate strategy to construct diverse histories through the re-presentation and monumentalization of cultural artifacts. Flora Willson will confront existing musicological notions of the boundaries of and preconditions for canonicity, focusing on the example of Meyerbeer. She will problematize these narratives by exploring the subtle but no less crucial processes of de-canonization and de-historicization.</p>

<p>Cormac Newark will discuss the reflection of the operatic canon in other forms of culture, especially nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature, and the short-circuits of mutual influence that reflection reveals. Raymond Knapp will address the legacy of the operatic canon in other genres and production contexts, above all musical theater, by which the canon fragmented into academic, political, and other sub-canons. Respondent Melanie Wald-Fuhrmann is co-editor of <em>Der Kanon der Musik: Theorie und Geschichte</em> (2013). Her response will offer a synthesis not only of the theoretical and historical issues they raise, but also of what the project as a whole can contribute to opera industry decision-making in the future.</p>
