<p>Cold War institutions and ideologies spurred some of the most agitated
documentary, political, and experimental filmmaking of the late twentieth
century. This discussion offers the opportunity for collective engagement with
the global nature and limitations of some of these radical projects through a
contextualized screening of film excerpts in which music and sound are
conceived of as doing revolutionary work. These films make up the first hour
of the evening panel, with an open discussion to follow, chaired by Kevin
Bartig.</p>

<p> To orient the audience as viewers and to offer theoretical talking points,
each panelist will introduce their curated selection over the course of five
minutes before presenting 15–20 minutes of film. Philip Gentry takes us into
Shirley Clarke’s experiments with abstract sound, dance, and the
transformation of the American urban life with selections from her
Bridges-Go-Round (1958) and The Connection (1961). Eduardo Herrera sets the
stage for a deep dive into Fernando “Pino” Solanas’s monumental critique of
neo-colonialism in Latin America in his monumental documentary film La hora de
los hornos (The Hour of the Furnaces, 1968). Chérie Rivers Ndaliko unpacks the
influence of Soviet film training on revolutionary African film through an
exploration of the historical erasures that drive Raoul Peck’s creative sound
work in Lumumba: La mort du prophète (1990).</p>

<p>Musics—diegetic and electronic, ambient and confrontational—cut across
the films’ critical engagement with imperialism, capitalism, and the global
order. Music and sound, too, are crucial to the cinematic intimacies,
localities, and specificities upon which the filmmakers insist. We hope the
conversation these films will stimulate across the audience will challenge
some of the tropes of Cold War cultural geography within music studies by
underscoring, for example, links between Africa and the Soviet Union, Latin
American responses to United States urban development projects, and an ethos
of internationalism that is disengaged from the nuclear standoff of
geopolitical superpowers.</p>
