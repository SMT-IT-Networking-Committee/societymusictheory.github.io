<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>In discourse surrounding musical composition, theory, and analysis, discussions of the influence of women have rarely ventured beyond the female patron/muse who supports/inspires the male creator. This session explores new paths of music-theoretical research that become available when we consider the actual or potential influence of women as creators and thinkers, both as individuals or through feminist approaches to music theory. In the first half of the session, speakers Rachel Lumsden (University of Oklahoma), Fred Maus (University of Virginia), and Vivian Luong (University of Michigan) will present three short papers (see abstracts below), followed by a response from Ellie M. Hisama (Columbia University).</p>
<p>The second half of the evening will provide informal opportunities for audience members to discuss the new directions in feminist music theory research suggested by these papers, brainstorm about other potential avenues of inquiry, and share their own research related to feminist music theory. We hope this session will both inform participants of current developments, and stimulate exciting new projects for twenty-first century music theorists.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“You Too Can Compose”: Ruth Crawford’s Mentoring of
      Vivian Fine</p>
<p class="abs-author">Rachel Lumsden (University of Oklahoma)</p>

<p>The prevailing climate of modernist music in the 1920s and early 1930s is typically characterized as being riddled with misogynist attitudes and hostility towards women; Parsons Smith (1994) famously described modernism as a staunchly “masculine” realm that was “profoundly destructive” for this particular generation of female composers. Scholars such as Hisama (2001/2007), Rao (2007/2014), Straus (1995), and Tick (1991/1997) have problematized these claims by exploring a broad range of Ruth Crawford’s musical contributions, yet one aspect of Crawford’s multifaceted career has not been studied in any substantive detail: her work as a composition teacher. From 1924 to 1929, Crawford taught composition to Vivian Fine, and their relationship also continued after Crawford’s move to New York City in 1929. Letters reveal a deep and affectionate bond that connected the two women well into the 1930s, and in later years Fine repeatedly named Crawford as her first significant musical mentor, noting the “incalculable importance” of Crawford to her musical development.</p>
<p>This paper discusses two different aspects of Crawford’s mentoring of Fine—discourse on modern music, and musical style—arguing that these areas reveal a distinctive viewpoint on composition, one that contains a specifically gendered perspective that differs from the postured masculinity typically associated with American ultramodernism. Ultimately, Crawford’s mentoring of Fine offers an important opportunity to examine the rich collaborative networks that some women created with one another during the height of American ultramodernism, and the impact that these relationships had on women’s work in atonal music during this era.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Women in the Recent History of Music Theory</p>
<p class="abs-author">Fred Maus (University of Virginia)</p>

<p>Few women figure in the history of twentieth-century music theory, as normally recounted. I identify three women who have made pioneering contributions to music theory. Because their work diverges from music theory norms, it does not seem central to the field.</p>
<p>Alexandra Pierce’s work on embodiment and performance contributes to the exploration of existing repertory, specifically European concert music. But instead of verbal or graphic symbols, her primary vocabulary for thinking about music consists of <i>felt bodily sensations</i>. To understand something about a phrase, one makes and feels a certain arm movement while hearing the phrase, for example, rather than verbally describing the sounds or marking on a score.</p>
<p>Pauline Oliveros works in the area of theory related to new musical creation. Her characteristic conceptual manoeuvre identifies a binary opposition, and emphasizes on the importance of both poles of the opposition. For instance, she values both focal and global awareness; attention to inner and outer phenomena; receptive listening and active sound-creation.</p>
<p>Helen Bonny’s work in music therapy uses recordings of classical repertory in relation to personal experiences of imagery and fantasy. Though Bonny’s procedures derive from psychotherapy, they offer more general insights into the nature of musical experience as a way of developing personal self-awareness. My underlying question is whether we can begin to think of these women, among others, as central contributors to music theory; and what effects this re-orientation would have on our sense of the nature of music theory.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Toward a Radical Theory of Feminist Music-Theoretical
      Ethics</p>
<p class="abs-author">Vivian Luong (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>This paper seeks to displace an implicit <i>moral</i> commitment in the work of music theorists—both feminist and otherwise—in favor of an <i>ethics</i> informed by feminist new materialisms (Barad 2007; Bennett 2010). First, I demonstrate how both feminist (Maus 1993) and traditional music theories (van den Toorn 1991) remain focused on defining and policing a musical morality—what ought to count as proper ways of doing music theory, of lovingly engaging with music professionally. Second, I read Marion A. Guck’s observations on music theory’s moralistic tendencies (1997) with Gayle Rubin’s essay on the problematic ethics behind the feminist sex wars of the 1970s and 80s. Finally, taking up Rubin’s call for a new, radical approach to feminist politics, I contemplate how a move toward new materialist ethics as outlined by Karen Barad’s theory of agential realism might intervene in our discipline’s fixation with the moral disciplining of music loving. What kind of new disciplinary engagements with music might emerge from this philosophical encounter?</p>
