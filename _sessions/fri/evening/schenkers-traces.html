<p>Understanding the full scope of Heinrich Schenker’s impact on the history
of music theory poses a daunting task. For one thing, Schenker has proven more
influential for present-day scholarship and education than any other single
theorist; for another, scholars have responded to Schenker in such divergent
ways that it is nearly impossible for a single study to encompass the diffuse
approaches that either emanate from or respond to the Schenkerian body of
knowledge. We can, however, delimit this conceptual playing field by
juxtaposing Schenker with specific historical figures or artifacts, and then
use this juxtaposition in order to extrapolate the broader consequences, or
traces, of Schenkerian thought within the history of theory today.</p>

<p>In a special session of 180 minutes, five scholars take up this task.
Drawing on documentation uploaded to the SMT website prior to the conference,
each presenter will offer a focused fifteen-minute presentation. The first
three contributors (part I) will position Schenker against a monumental figure
or musical work, each of which has left an indelible mark on the history of
music theory and ideas: Jean-Philippe Rameau; Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel;
and Richard Wagner’s <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>. The two subsequent
contributors (part II) will then zoom in on contemporaries of Schenker—August
Halm and Viktor Zuckerkandl—whose respective correspondence and writings offer
new perspectives on Schenker’s work and on the later “Americanization” of
Schenker studies. Each part will include a response from an additional,
invited panelist; a closing round-table discussion will conclude the session
as a whole.</p>
