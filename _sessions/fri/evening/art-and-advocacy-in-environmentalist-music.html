<p>The 2016 AMS Annual Meeting takes place astride the Salish Sea, a distinct ecosystem and soundscape. This session brings together AMS scholars and environmentalist musicians based in the Vancouver area, asking difficult questions concerning art, education, and advocacy.</p>

<p>Throughout the region, musical educators like Vancouver’s Bobs &amp; Lolo and the Artist Response Team (ART) use performance-based pedagogy to educate, entertain, and advocate for better collective stewardship. The renowned Solidarity Notes Labour Choir provides artful support to a range of causes throughout Canada. First Nations drummers lead Idle No More marches through the streets of Vancouver, opposing damaging pipeline plans. Dana Lyons’s “Great Salish Sea Tour” organizes audiences along the route to oppose coal-shipping terminals and oil trains. “Gaggles” of Raging Grannies protect old growth forests on Vancouver Island, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>The Solidarity Notes Labour Choir, Artist Response Team, and Bobs &amp; Lolo will perform several songs, in turn, leading to open discussion around questions concerning musical education and advocacy. Sabine Feisst, Tyler Kinnear, and Stephen Meyer will introduce each of the three performances and lead follow-up discussion. Topics will include conundrums in environmentalist composition, challenges in environmentally themed musical pedagogy, the role of natural sound and soundscapes, and issues that arise from the dialogue between audience and artists.</p>
<p>The goal of this evening session is to take on the question of art as advocacy via open exchange. Musicians are often no less conflicted than critics and scholars when it comes to musical advocacy and continually struggle to find a meaningful balance between creative expression, political action, artistry, and entertainment. Our guest ensembles will demonstrate how that struggle can lead to truly remarkable art and entertainment. Per the goal of the AMS evening sessions, this event will allow musicians, scholars, and audience to engage the subject in an artful and entertaining fashion. The session will be catered with sustainably sourced local refreshments.</p>
