<p class="abs-title">Movement in Music and Dance: A Neoclassical Collaboration for <em>Orpheus</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Gretchen Horlacher (Indiana University)</p>

<p>Imagine the opening of a ballet whose central character stands with his back to the audience, motionless, for more than two minutes. This is exactly what happens in the Stravinsky-Balanchine collaboration for <em>Orpheus</em> from 1948. The opening music also displays unusual qualities of stasis; the alliance between dance and music sets forth a neoclassical work whose scarce and idiosyncratic movement underlies its mournful and ritualistic theme.</p>
<p>The collaborations of composer Igor Stravinsky with choreographer George Balanchine are held as an exemplar of artistic collaboration, and their work together on the ballet <em>Orpheus</em> is documented as particularly close. I will describe how music and dance interrelate in the ballet’s most critical scene, as Orpheus attempts to lead Eurydice back to earth. In particular, I will pay attention to the two artists’ manipulation of repetitive movement.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Re-Hearing Schumann: A Ballet, a Quartet Adagio, and Multivalent Identity</p>
<p class="abs-author">Julie Hedges Brown (Northern Arizona University)</p>

<p>The 1975 ballet <em>Four Schumann Pieces</em>, set to Schumann’s A-major String Quartet by the Dutch choreographer Hans van Manen, illustrates how dance might provide an alternative framework for understanding a musical work. A devotee of Balanchine and his creed to “make the music visible,” yet someone also interested in human relationships, Van Manen produced here a work that sheds light on Schumann’s unusual treatment of classical forms.</p>
<p>The Adagio’s choreography, for instance, explores identity and sexuality as relational notions. Although it features two men and two women dancers, Van Manen undermines conventional Cavalier-ballerina monogamy by highlighting a male soloist who joins with each woman, along with the other man, in separate duets.</p>
<p>Reinforcing a polymorphous perspective, Van Manen reconfigures gender protocols, occasionally swapping traditional “masculine” and “feminine” gestures between the sexes.</p>
<p>How might such perspectives illuminate the music? Although non-programmatic, Schumann’s Adagio also resists conventional markers and hierarchies in ways that suggest multivalent identities. The main idea, for instance, undergoes constant variation: though stated numerous times, it never returns the same and no one statement is shown as primary. Resistance to a fixed identity also illuminates the Adagio’s form, one that has (tellingly) been read as theme-and-variations, a rondo, or free sonata form. While each reading accounts for crucial aspects, understanding the movement’s form ultimately requires that we accept the co-existence of multiple structural frameworks. By softening musical boundaries through choreographic means, Van Manen’s ballet holds promise for re-hearing the music of even a well-known composer.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Dancing an Analysis: Approaching Popular Music Theory through Dance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Robin Attas (Elon University)</p>

<p>Popular music appeals to diverse audiences, suggesting a potential for equally diverse analytical approaches. However, music theorists often privilege methods that require extensive formal musical education in the Western conservatory tradition, preventing contributions from the vast majority of the music’s practitioners and fans. This paper brings these voices into music-theoretical dialogue through analysis of improvised dance moves. I report on a small study where I filmed thirteen subjects improvising dances to ten pop songs. My analysis focuses on dances to Mother Mother’s “My Baby Don’t Dance” (a rock song which participants had never heard before), Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” (a pop/rock song which every participant knew well), and Katy Perry’s “Birthday (a pop song known to some of the participants) in order to explore how dancers’ moves both reinforce existing theoretical models and suggest new ones. In particular, I consider implications for metric and formal theory: how the presence of periodic dance moves at a range of pulse layers reinforces most current metric theories, while the cyclic nature of dance moves and the differences among dancers offer new metric interpretations; and how changes in body movements and overall energy suggest both an awareness of typical large-scale and small-scale formal sections and the potential for other formal narratives. Ultimately, this study not only expands the ways in which theorists analyze popular music, it also expands the number of people who can be considered music theorists in the first place.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Non-Monotonality and Proto-Harmony in Rachmaninoff</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ellen Bakulina (University of North Texas)</p>

<p>In the last few decades, questions of non-monotonality have attracted substantial analytical attention (see works by Kinderman, Krebs, Rothstein, LaRue, Lewis, and most recently Wadsworth, and Nobile). The present study contributes to this discourse by developing a related concept from current Russian theory— proto-harmony, introduced by Andrei Miasoedov (1998) as a diatonic complex of four fifth-related triads. My goal is to show that proto-harmony creates tonally open structures by interacting with a movement’s large-scale form and cadential organization.</p>
<p>According to Miasoedov, none of the four proto-harmonic chords claims supremacy as “the tonic” of a piece. This general idea notwithstanding, Miasoedov never discusses complete pieces in detail. I pursue this goal by analyzing two proto-harmonic movements from Rachmaninoff’s choral <em>Vigil</em> (1915). I propose three specific ways large-scale structures manifest proto-harmony: (1) beginnings and ends of the movement and of individual phrases, (2) the cadential plan, and</p>
<p>(3) the harmonic content of cadential phrases.</p>
<p>Movement 1 illustrates the idea. The movement begins on a D-minor chord and ends on G; phrase endings articulate A major, and the final cadence has the plagal progression C–G. Together, these chords comprise the proto-harmonic complex G-a-C-d (A is “majorized” as a local V of D minor). In movement 14, the same complex operates through the framing D-minor and G-major harmonies, and the internal authentic cadences on C. These analyses help us expand our understanding of pieces that defy the norms of monotonality while retaining certain elements of diatonic tonal structure.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Pushing the Boundaries: Mismatch and Overlap in Shostakovich’s “Classical” Structures</p>
<p class="abs-author">Charity Lofthouse (Hobart and William Smith Colleges) and Sarah Marlowe (New York University)</p>


<p>Dmitri Shostakovich often composes within “Classical” frameworks, yet his use of traditional structures displays ongoing experimentation with formal and tonal borders. Through the lenses of Sonata Theory and Schenkerian techniques, this paper highlights Shostakovich’s practice of expressive boundary obfuscation in his sonata forms and fugues.</p>
<p>Shostakovich engages two kinds of formal blurring in his sonata structures: first is the intermixing and overlapping of rhetorical and thematic components from both Type 2 and Type 3 sonatas at the post-development boundary. Second, Shostakovich consistently misaligns thematic and tonal/harmonic elements at seams between the exposition’s MC and S zones, exposition and development, and sonata and coda spaces. Blended sonata types and mismatched boundary events evoke a narrative of ambiguity regarding the movement’s willingness to accomplish genre-normative structural tasks associated with historical precedents. Similar features emerge when examining tonal structure in in his op. 87 fugues, wherein rhetorical and structural closures appear to be intentionally misaligned. Undoubtedly aware of the expectations created by familiar eighteenth-century fugal gestures, Shostakovich positions his fugue subjects in ways that simultaneously satisfy thematic expectation yet withhold tonal closure. Additionally, his reliance on linear motion to connect beginnings and endings of sections stretches his “tonality” to its very limits.</p>
<p>These analyses highlight the importance of Shostakovich’s mismatches and overlaps in creating expressive tension between his sonatas and fugues and their “Classical” antecedents. That the same processes emerge through both Sonata Theory and Schenkerian approaches also suggests that such boundary experimentation is a broader compositional trend in Shostakovich’s <em>oeuvre</em>.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Prokofiev’s Chromaticism in Fairy Tales: <em>Cinderella</em> and <em>Peter and the Wolf</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Deborah Rifkin (Ithaca College)</p>

<p>This talk explores relationships between musical and literary narratives in <em>Peter and the Wolf</em> (1936) and <em>Cinderella</em> (1944). Both works were written in Prokofiev’s self-professed “new simplicity style,” featuring a self-conscious return to classical precedents such as eighteenth-century phrase structures, clear cadential goals, and lyrical melodies. Prokofiev deforms classical conventions, however, with an idiosyncratic use of chromaticism that features sudden swerves to distant keys within otherwise tight-knit phrase structures. By invoking and then thwarting classical conventions, Prokofiev creates a musical landscape that is fertile with narrative potential. In eighteenth-century contexts, chromaticism acts as a loosening device, or as a means of expression and expansion. By denying this expectation, Prokofiev’s quirky and sudden chromatic swerves become marked events that can be imbued with musical meaning.</p>
<p>Prokofiev himself wrote the story for <em>Peter and the Wolf,</em> calling Peter “Pioneer Peter,” a reference to Stalin’s Pioneer Youth. In this orchestral tale for children, Peter is a typical hero who displays bravery, strength and cunning. Yet, Peter’s theme is an ironic parallel period with chromatic mediant successions that threaten tonal stability. As a ballet, <em>Cinderella</em> is less explicitly programmatic, yet the polarities of gender and class are paramount. At the pinnacle of the dramatic tension—Cinderella’s Waltz—Prokofiev garishly satires the waltz genre. In both settings, the idiosyncratic chromaticism at the phrase level challenges not only musical conventions but also literary ones, hinting at broader social and political implications.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Analysis, and the Dilemma of Music Genealogy: The Cases of Ruth Crawford and Johanna Beyer</p>
<p class="abs-author">Nancy Yunhwa Rao (Rutgers University)</p>


<p>This paper explores issues of historiography concerning American women composers: stylistic categories, analytical framework and historical context. It focuses on two composers connected to American ultra-modernism: Ruth Crawford (1901–53) and Johanna Beyer (1888–1944). As the history of American serialism unfolds, Crawford has been, albeit “gendered,” increasingly recognized as part of the musical lineage. Such recognition helps to confirm Crawford’s place in the established historical narrative. Yet, the invocation of this stylistic category suppresses the ultra-modern aesthetics and composition techniques germane to her work, which, ironically, constitutes Crawford’s most important imprint in modern composition. On the other hand, studies that bring attention to Beyer’s work invariably point to her originality, while downplaying the connection between her work and composition styles of ultra-modernism, lest the claim of originality is compromised. Though in a different way, such a strategy ironically also suppresses the ultra-modern aesthetic germane to her composition.</p>
<p>The paper demonstrates the above paradoxical situations through analytical examples of Crawford and Beyer’s music. Then, the paper argues that music analyses sensitive to composition theories, aesthetic ideals and cultural milieu of their time are fruitful to the establishment of music genealogy of these two women composers. Such analyses also lead to a fuller understanding of their originality. The paper draws from two comparative analyses: (1) Crawford’s <em>String Quartet 1931</em> and Beyer’s String Quartet no. 2; (2) Crawford’s <em>Four Diaphonic Suites</em> and Beyer’s <em>Suite for Clarinet I</em>.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Blind and Imaged: Musical Intuitions in an Open Work</p>
<p class="abs-author">Antonella Di Giulio (Buffalo State College)</p>

<p>For his initial theorization of the open work the semiotician Umberto Eco uses some contemporary works characterized by the autonomy granted to the performers. Music scholars have often interpreted Eco’s musical choices as an apodictic proposition for the definition of openness in music. However this selection, which includes some of Berio’s works, portrays a basic theoretical ambiguity between a work intended as finished and a work delivered as finished to the listener. For instance, a work is defined as open if it offers a labyrinth of infinite pathways delimited in a pre-established form.</p>
<p>Using as a point of departure Petrassi’s first <em>Invenzione</em> for piano and of Sciarrino’s <em>Etude de concert,</em> this paper will analyze the implementations in the development of a germinal idea in a closed structure (imaged) of an open work (blind). These two twentieth century composers follow a logic based on contrasting routes: while in Petrassi’s music a simple initial idea creates a complex path, Sciarrino follows an opposite process, as his works are architecturally-designed spaces, which are compressed in one initial sketch.</p>
<p>However both compositional processes, seen as a network of interlinked relationships, don’t consider music as a mere combination of static elements, but reflect the idea of a delimited musical structure which allows both an indefinite number of solutions and the participation of performers and listeners in the imagination of the work. This kind of representation is a cognitive operation, which brings an amorphous intuition of the artist into an organic form of art.</p>

<p class="abs-title">“Border Crossing” in Dario Marianelli’s Score for <em>Atonement</em></p>
<p class="abs-author">Patricia Hall (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>The film score for <em>Atonement</em> has often been described as “fluid” in that characters in the film inadvertently participate in the film score. For instance, Briony’s repetition of a single piano note becomes a percussive element.</p>
<p>In this paper I focus on the most striking of these hybrids between diegetic and non-diegetic sound: the cue accompanying Robbie’s exploration of the beach during the evacuation of Dunkirk. Filmed as a single tracking shot of five-and-a-half minutes, the cue begins as a non-diegetic expression of Robbie’s reaction to this scene of ordered chaos, but then unites with the diegetic hymn, “Dear Lord and Father of Mankind” sung by English soldiers on a bandstand.</p>
<p>Using the metaphor of border crossing, I tie this cue to the military event it accompanies, the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940. Described in propaganda speeches as “the miracle of Dunkirk,” it involved the evacuation of over 300,000 British and French soldiers from German occupied France to the safety of England in the span of a week, often relying on small, privately owned fishing boats.</p>
<p>Finally, I show how the concept of border crossing could be applied to other films, for instance, <em>Wings of Desire</em>. Filmed two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, it features human-appearing angels who congregate around Potsdamer Platz, the location of the East-West divide, and who hear the inner thoughts worried Berliners. One of these angels succeeds in becoming human after falling in love with a trapeze artist dressed as an angel.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Repetition and Formal Destruction in Popular Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Laura Emmery (Emory University)</p>

<p>Repetition in both the Western canon and popular music is used to delineate formal boundaries and generate cohesive structures. Arnold Schoenberg observed that form in music serves to bring about comprehensibility through memorability, and that repetition contributes to an organization which makes music intelligible. However, in this study I show that repetition can also be used to blur these lines of formal demarcation and ultimately destroy our sense of formal expectation. My central argument is that surface repetition itself is not sufficient for comprehending the large-scale organization of a piece. Rather, comprehension arises from the regularity of the interval of repetition. The key element is the integration of repetition and form with the notion of metric hierarchy. That is, repetition in itself does not add to the coherence without the establishment of a perceived hypermeter. Building on current cognitive and biological studies on repetition in music, meter theories, and the role memory plays in recalling familiar events (Margulis 2014; Huron 2007; Gjerdingen 2007; Deleuze 2004; London 2004, Snyder 2000; Hasty 1999; Epstein 1995; Kivy 1993) my study demonstrates through specific examples in popular music repertoire how repetition obstructs the listener’s perception of formal cohesion. That is, as soon as the repetitions of harmonic progressions no longer follow the previously established recurring periodic pattern, the listener is no longer able to form a projection of an event, consequently obliterating the listener’s sense of form.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Analyzing the Popular Voice</p>
<p class="abs-author">Victoria Malawey (Macalaster College)</p>

<p>Unlike other aspects of musical content—such as harmony, form, melody, and rhythm, for which scholars have developed sophisticated analytic systems—analytic approaches to vocal delivery remain grossly underdeveloped, due in part to the baffling complexity of the human singing voice and its inherent multi-dimensionality. For scholars analyzing musical content of popular music, this analytic void becomes even more problematic when one considers that for most popular genres, vocal content tends to influence the meanings listeners ascribe to song recordings, perhaps more so than any other musical parameter. Given the proliferation of pop music analysis in the field of music theory, music analysts need a systematic model for interpreting vocal delivery, now more than ever. To this end, I propose a theoretical model for analyzing vocal delivery in popular song recordings focused on three overlapping areas of inquiry: pitch, prosody, and quality. These areas intersect with other musical and lyrical cues that connote singers’ subject positions and meanings listeners ascribe to popular song recordings. Although the model focuses primarily on the sonic, material aspects of vocal delivery, brief analyses of excerpts of cover songs recorded by Lucas Silveira not only demonstrate the basic elements of the model, but also situate these aspects among broader cultural, philosophical, and anthropological approaches to voice with the goal to better understand the relationship between sonic content and its signification.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Listening with a Gendered Ear</p>
<p class="abs-author">Jacqueline Warwick (Dalhousie University)</p>

<p>The notion of the male gaze has greatly informed analytical approaches in film studies and other disciplines grounded in visual culture. The idea that the camera trains viewers to look at women’s bodies as sexualized objects, regardless of the gender or sexuality of the individual viewer, has been transformative and highly influential. But if the act of looking is shaped by gender conventions, can the same be true of the act of listening? Is it possible that we listen with gendered ears? In this short presentation I will explore the idea of how gender shapes our experience of listening, and will discuss how attention to gender might illuminate music analysis based in listening.</p>
