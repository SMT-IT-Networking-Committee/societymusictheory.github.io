<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Thomas F. DeFrantz’s presentation will illuminate significant connections between music-making practices and audiences’ participatory engagement through dance. Theorists and practitioners concur that black music and dance emerge in concert, each bringing the other to light. Yet, while issues of embodiment and dance have long been significant topics within black music studies, musicologists could do more to meaningfully engage in dialogue with dance studies scholars working on these issues. Toward that end, Professor DeFrantz’s presentation will explore the particular ways in which African American dance and music relate to each other to produce form. How do particular rhythms make movement manifest? How is it that particular musical grooves demand particular movements? The presentation will explore at least two genres in some depth: New Orleans Bounce music—a local dance-oriented genre of hip-hop—and 1970s funk, specifically the music of Marvin Gaye and Earth, Wind and Fire.</p>
