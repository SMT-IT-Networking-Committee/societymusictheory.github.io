<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>For 2017, the Committee on the Status of Women is hosting a session on the
music of renowned composer, Chen Yi, to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of
SMT in 2017, as well as the thirtieth anniversary of the Committee on the
Status of Women.</p>

<p>Performed and commissioned by musicians and ensembles, including Yehudi
Menuhin, Evelyn Glennie, the Cleveland Orchestra, the BBC Symphony, and the
Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden, Dr. Chen's music “blends Chinese and Western
traditions, transcending cultural and musical boundaries.” To delve into her
music deeply, the session will have three parts: it will begin with a workshop
conducted by Chen Yi on her chamber work, <i>Happy Rain on a Spring Night</i>,
for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano. The score and a recording will
be circulated ahead of time, so the audience and the panel can prepare for the
session.</p>

<p>In the second hour, three scholars (John Roeder, Marianne Kielian-Gilbert,
and Nancy Rao) will give 20-minute analytical presentations on various aspects
of Chen Yi’s music, while the third hour will be devoted to discussion by
panel members, the composer, and the audience.</p>
