<p>In response to an initiative of the AMS Board of Directors, and at the request of AMS President Ellen Harris, a planning group of scholars who have shown strong commitment to the Society are overseeing the development of a new committee, provisionally titled the “Committee on the Status of Race and Ethnicity in the Profession.” This special session will include short remarks from some of the planning group members concerning salient issues that the group has been considering, and will also include opportunities for members to comment, both in the session space and remotely (including anonymously, if desired). Among the issues to be addressed are scholarly initiatives that the AMS can support in the very near future, including paper sessions, study groups, and panels; sessions and working groups on professional development; awards and subventions for scholarly work on race and ethnicity; and the development of public bibliographies and other online resources. This session is expected to provide perspectives on the new committee’s mission and strategy, as well as providing a forum and context for the presentation of important issues to the AMS membership as a whole. An active web platform for solicitation of ideas will be available for commentary both before and after the session.</p>
