<p class="abs-title">Reimagining (Motivic) Analysis in Light of Performance</p>
<p class="abs-author">Andrew M. Friedman (Harvard University)</p>

<p>Though performance has over the last quarter-century earned a seat at the analytical table, what it can say tends to be limited by standard analytical categories and methodologies. Lingering textualism and an empiricist bias in much performance analysis scholarship, I argue, have ironically sidelined the listener’s experience, thereby leaving untapped the more radical capacity of performance to challenge the very terms and techniques of traditional, score-oriented music analysis. In this talk I point to one way in which attending to performance—or more accurately, one’s experience of performance—can effect a refashioning of one of the discipline’s basic terms and techniques: motive and motivic analysis. In a comparative analysis of Mitsuko Uchida’s and Ludwig Sémerjian’s opening of Mozart’s K. 332, I trace the contrasting motives and motivic connections these recordings fashion and consider their distinct phrase and formal implications. I then detail the vastly different ways Claudio Arrau and Ivo Pogorelich constitute “the” motive in mm.1–4 of Chopin’s op. 28, 1. In place of a score-based, pitch-rhythmic, pattern-matching approach to motive and motivic analysis I offer an experiential one that allows performances to qualitatively fashion their own motives and motivic paths through a piece. By prioritizing the music as heard rather than as notated (or even as microtimed), the event rather than the object, this kind of analytical practice can not only yield insight into performances, works, and the experience of listening, but also serve as a constructive critique of theory itself.</p>

<p>Structural models for Western art music are primarily score-based and rarely incorporate the views of performers. I have attempted to redress the omission through a multi-phase study of rehearsal discourse by professional string quartets based in Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States. This paper presents the findings from the Hong Kong phase of the project. Over a six-month period, I attended and recorded the Romer String Quartet’s rehearsals and public performances as a participant-observer. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the rehearsal footage, along with interviews with the players, offer insights on how a professional string quartet perceive, conceptualize and communicate about musical structure. My research reveals that although parameters such as formal articulations, harmonic changes and motivic continuity were rarely singled out for discussion in rehearsals, the players did pay close attention to structure within the context of feeling and character or in relation to considerations of sound and ensemble co-ordination. While the quartet’s communication relied extensively on metaphorical descriptions rather than music-theoretical terminology, when asked to explain the meaning of their metaphors the players referred to very specific aspects of compositional syntax. Thus, in its combination of overt expressive considerations and latent structural understanding, the rehearsal discourse suggests that the relationship between the two is more complex and less exclusive than some have assumed. These observations prompt critical reflection on ways of mediating between theoretical and practical perspectives of musical structure, and demonstrate how methodological interactions between theory and ethnomusicology might contribute to such mediation.</p>
