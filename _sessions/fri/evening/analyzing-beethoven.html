<p class="abs-title">Formalizing the <em>Eroica</em>: The E Minor Theme and the Structure of Analytical Revolutions</p>
<p class="abs-author">John Z. McKay (University of South Carolina)</p>


<p>The first movement of Beethoven’s Third Symphony has been the source of endless analytical commentary during the past two centuries. The earliest reviewers declared it to be a “a daring and wild fantasia” that “often loses itself in lawlessness,” and even a piece where the “sense of unity is almost completely lost.” In recent analyses, however, the first movement is often held up as a quintessential exemplar of sonata form as expanded in the early Romantic Period.</p>
<p>This presentation will examine the historical process by which the opening Allegro to Beethoven’s <em>Eroica</em> was slowly transformed from a free-ranging “fantasia” to a problematic “sonata form” and finally to a standard canonic example of analytical “unity.” Using frameworks taken from the history and philosophy of science, including Thomas Kuhn’s <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> and Imre Lakatos’s “research programs,” the reception history of the <em>Eroica</em> will serve as a case study for how analytical paradigms come into being and are modified over time.</p>
<p>While various elements of form have been debated within the first movement, the E minor theme of the development section has perhaps the most wide-ranging set of interpretations. Early “pre-paradigm” reviewers sometimes noted its appearance, but with Marx’s <em>Formenlehre</em>, the E minor theme came to represent a specific formal problem. A survey of dozens of analyses over the centuries will demonstrate how this thematic “problem” was gradually defined, then “solved” in various ways, and ultimately absorbed into the core of current form theories.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Positively Ironic: Beethoven’s “Serioso” String Quartet in F minor, op. 95</p>

<p>Beethoven acknowledged the radical nature of his <em>Quartetto serioso</em> (1810) when he noted that it had been written for “a small circle of connoisseurs” and was “never to be performed in public.” Challenging as the work may be altogether, it is the finale’s coda that has proven most problematic for critics. With its sudden and unprepared shift from minor to major, serious to comic, high to low, and without any clear thematic link to the body of the movement, this brief coda has “baffled many a dedicated Beethovenian” (Lockwood), eliciting responses that have included bewilderment (Marx) and outright dismissal (d’Indy). A number of more recent accounts (Longyear, Hatten, November) have pointed to irony as a rationale for the coda’s sudden reversal of tone, which seems to negate all that has gone before: even the work’s designation as a “serious” quartet is not to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Beethoven’s contemporaries, however, were more inclined to embrace irony as a constructive, liberating device. Figures such as Friedrich Schlegel, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Ludwig Tieck, and Adam Müller—all of them present in Vienna at some point during the period 1808–10—championed irony not simply as a means of negation but as the primary instrument of an epistemological framework that promoted the accommodation of multiple—even opposing—perspectives. By this line of thought, irony functions negatively only at the most obvious level. Its antifoundationalist nature encourages a mode of understanding that moves beyond the limitations of linear, syllogistic reasoning and beyond the valorization of any one “correct” perspective. Irony thus provided early romantic philosophers with an instrument by which to overcome the divide between subjectivity and objectivity. Beethoven’s use of the term “serioso” here and elsewhere (op. 82/4, op. 120), moreover, provides yet another indicator of the presence of irony, for unlike the more common “serio,” it can suggest in certain contexts, unrecognized by previous scholarship, a sense of ostentatious seriousness, of a pathos that borders on bathos. The <em>Quartetto serioso</em> is Beethoven’s most radical essay in irony, a device that would permeate his later works in more subtle but no less far-reaching ways.</p>
