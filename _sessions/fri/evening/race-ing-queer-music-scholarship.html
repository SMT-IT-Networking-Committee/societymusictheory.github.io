<p class="abs-title">On Beyoncé’s “Formation” and Black Anger: How to Be an Ally in Musicological Discourse</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kira Dralle (University of California, Santa Cruz)</p>

<p>Musicology has traditionally marginalized theories that have become canonical in the critical discourse today. Issues of affect, of the haptic sensorium, and of practical issues concerning musical pedagogy, still fight to find a place within the institution of music. These theories address the issues of the lived bodies of performers and audiences alike, and directly address what topics are most urgent in our contemporary musicological discourse. Queer musicology has introduced the emotive into scholarly work, but has done little to address the emotive as culturally specific to issues of race and of intersectionality. If musicology supported the pedagogical works of Gloria Anzaldùa and bell hooks, or the school-to-prison pipeline writings of Angela Davis, we might better avoid racially insensitive teachings of opera in a prison system. We might then find a greater understanding of intersectionality through interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>This paper will address musicology’s marginalization of types of analysis that speak to emotion or embodiment, emphasizing more specifically the complete erasure of the black emotive or of black embodiment. Using Beyoncé’s recent release of <em>Formation</em> and subsequent performance at Super Bowl 50, I trace the ways in which black anger is delegitimized and criminalized, resulting in both paralyzing fear and silence from a white audience. This paper also explores how Beyoncé’s feminism and explicit sexual agency is a radically queered version of many of the feminisms of musicological discourse. It opens up non-normative ways of expressing gender, sexuality, and motherhood, which are explicitly nonwhite. The goals of this paper lie in opening conversations at the margins of our discipline, at the margins of academic, popular, and black feminism, and at the margins of affect theory and queer studies. Intersectionality must be understood through interdisciplinarity.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Race-ing and Queering the Historical Mission of American Musicology through Public Musicology</p>
<p class="abs-author">Eric Hung (Westminster Choir College of Rider University)</p>


<p>The development of American musicology in the early twentieth century occurred in an environment where Western art music was seen as having a “civilizing influence” upon the masses. Testifying before Congress in 1924, Jacob Hayman argued that training in Western art music can reduce social upheavals by the lower classes by bringing “contentment and cheer” into their homes. At the same time, Francis Elliott Clark, as Director of the Educational Department at Victor Records, argued that knowledge of symphonic and operatic music is essential in the moral education of school children.</p>
<p>These early American musicologists established curricula and developed research methodologies that are, in many ways, still normative today. As the recent <em>Musicology Now</em> uproar demonstrates, the “civilizing mission”—with its championing of Western art music and ridicule of popular music—remains a central tenet for many musicologists today.</p>
<p>This paper argues that truly race-ing and queering this historical mission requires new methodologies that allow us to better understand the musicking of people of color and other marginalized groups. As Bob Fink demonstrated in “Elvis Everywhere,” while traditional and critical theory-based methodologies are excellent at uncovering the original contexts surrounding a work’s composition, they do not generally help us comprehend the listening practices of the public.</p>
<p>What is needed right now are techniques of public musicology, an emerging field that builds upon “shared authority” methodologies developed by public historians, museum curators, and applied ethnomusicologists. In the presentation, I will examine two public history projects that can be adapted by musicologists to study the musicking of marginalized communities. The first is the Philadelphia Public History Truck, which uses oral histories and artifacts provided by community members to tell the stories of particular neighborhoods. The second is an interactive timeline called The Knotted Line.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Defense Mechanisms: Queering Musicological Aversions to Critical Race Theory</p>
<p class="abs-author">Kai Finlayson (New York University)</p>


<p>What are our disciplinary defenses against race-ing the “mainstream” of music scholarship, and what can these defenses teach us about queer music scholarship today? My paper seeks to provoke and analyze these defenses, particularly around the question of “relevance.” I discuss the layers of defense against the topic of race surrounding my dissertation project, and show how an examination of the logic of each layer not only sharpens the relevance of critical race theory, but also suggests how “race-ing” queer theories of music lets me articulate the relevance of my transgender experience to my scholarly project.</p>
<p>Because my dissertation is about wind instruments in German-speaking lands around 1800, this paper discusses an especially high number of defenses of the supposed “irrelevance” of the topic of race. Although my research on eroticized organological change and listening practices to Harmonie wind music informs my discussion, the particular case study I will discuss in terms of “relevance” engages the set of interrelated operas featuring enchanted wind instruments, composed between 1789 and 1797. These magical operas refract plot structures of the theatrical and literary “colonial fantasies” Susanne Zantop describes in the German-speaking late eighteenth century, and gather key scenes around the thematic of hearing and playing wind instruments. In my discussion of defenses, I use and critique German Studies scholarship on gender and race around 1800, and thereby address the defense of temporal-geographical irrelevance. Next, I consider the interplay between magical instruments and exoticism, and address how scholarship on both musical exoticisms and sexualities defends itself against critical race theory. Lastly, I analyze how these scenes of listening produce Spillers’s “flesh,” and discuss the defense that claims critical race theory only applies to music featuring racialized bodies, and hence the implications for queer theories of musical embodiment.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Color of Queer Critique: Sonic Performances of Blackness and Queer Temporality</p>
<p class="abs-author">Ali Na (University of California, Santa Cruz)</p>

<p>Queering musicology does not necessarily address systems of whiteness that are co-constitutive with heteronormativity. Thus, queering demands attention to critical race studies—a turn to race-ing queer music studies. This need to approach queer sonic forms with race points to the precise problem outlined by queer of color critique, and this paper asks whether or not queer of color critique accounts for race-ing queer music. Does it put queerness before race? How might blackness be an already queer form of aesthetic critique? This paper argues for a methodological approach of race-ing queer music that affirms the use of race, as imbricated with sexuality, as a starting point. Focusing on vocal performances that characteristically deploy pauses, silences, and the break, this paper turns to Thomas DeFrantz’s “Performing the Breaks: Notes on African American Aesthetics” and “Blacking Queer Dance” alongside Fred Moten’s <em>In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition</em>. These texts serve as jumping-off points for considering race in contemporary queer temporality scholarship. In sum, this paper argues that the break cannot be disarticulated from a particular black aesthetic, providing a means of queering musical time that foregrounds racialization. Analyzing black queer temporality through both the ephemeral qualities of performing sound and the materiality of the bodies of performers thus contributes to the critique of social normativity in music studies.</p>
