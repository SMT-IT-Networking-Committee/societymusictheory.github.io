<h2>Abstracts</h2>


<p>Scholars who wish to publish research on copyrighted music are often daunted by the prospects of navigating copyright permissions and claiming fair use. Moreover, they usually are not even sure how to begin such negotiations. This joint session addresses these issues. Three presenters will discuss their experience producing articles and books on popular music and art music. After this, two respondents, with expertise in publishing and information accessibility, and experience consulting legal professionals, will offer complementary perspectives. We expect this session to be of considerable value to members of both societies, and wish to reserve the remaining time for questions from (and discussion with) audience members.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Navigating Copyright Permissions/Evaluating Fair Use</p>
<p class="abs-author">Keith Salley (Shenandoah Conservatory)</p>

<p>My presentation first outlines the challenges I encountered publishing an article that reproduces popular song lyrics. I discuss the negotiation of national and international permissions (many artists use different houses at these levels), as well as most-favored-nation clauses (where copyright holders require additional compensation if other copyright holders involved in a project elect to charge a higher fee). I also defend the position of publishing houses, but explain how their primary concern in determining how much to charge—mainly, the number of copies to be printed—is not relevant to the way scholars typically access data today. The second part of my presentation weighs the pros and cons of not asking for permissions. I discuss the purposefully vague wording of copyright law regarding fair use, which can be interpreted as protecting scholars as much as copyright holders. I also cite more egregious abuses of copyright law in websites such as lyricstime.com and—to an extent—YouTube.com that currently go unchecked. My conclusion urges scholars to consider the landscape of fair use and permissions in as informed a manner as possible.</p>


<p class="abs-title">Music Scholarship and Music Publishers: Common Problems and Potential Solutions</p>
<p class="abs-author">Lars Helgert (Catholic University of America)</p>

<p>Most types of historical and theoretical music scholarship cannot be conducted without the use of notated musical examples. In the United States, musical works published after 1922 enjoy copyright protections that can prevent them from being excerpted in print without the permission of a copyright holder (usually a music publishing firm). This often means that music publishers hold considerable leverage over music scholarship, which they regularly use to charge high fees for reprint permission and insert unfavorable clauses in reprint licenses. The fair use doctrine can be an inadequate defense against these business practices, because publishers of scholarly writings are often unwilling to risk litigation. This presentation is based on the author’s difficulties attempting to secure reprint permission from four different music publishers for a scholarly article. These experiences suggest that current law and business practices regarding reprint permission for music are a significant impediment to scholarship on twentieth- and twenty-first century works. In this paper, I aim to draw attention to this important issue and propose strategies for overcoming this obstacle to our work.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Fair Use Considerations in Rock Scholarship</p>
<p class="abs-author">Walter Everett (University of Michigan)</p>

<p>I cover the four basic tenets of fair use in copyright law as I understand them: the purpose of the quotation (as in being necessary to support scholarly commentary), the insubstantiality of quotation length (sharing my guidelines for setting lengths and avoiding the “heart of the work”), the commercial nature of the use (profit does not necessarily preclude a fair use claim; parody is an example), and the impact of use on the owner’s property value (print quotations, even of full lyrics, would inflict little to no harm on the owner’s market value, though sound quotations may possibly be a different matter). My understanding is that a balance of all four factors must be weighed, rather than satisfying some absolute value for each of the four.</p>
<p>Next, I discuss my experiences both in seeking permissions to quote from a wide range of copyright holders and their agents (some of whom have been quite liberal in their understanding of quotable music), in declaring fair use (my Beatles volumes achieving some notoriety on this point), in publishing voice-leading sketches of entire compositions without seeking permission, and in considering some grey areas of the composer’s identity.</p>
