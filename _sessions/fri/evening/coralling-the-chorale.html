<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>Four-part chorale-style writing is so central to music theory pedagogy that
it is difficult to imagine a curriculum without it. Yet, as much as we rely on
chorales to teach general principles of music, they are specific in structure
and their origins lie in a specifically German theological tradition. This
raises a number of questions: are chorales effective for the purposes to which
we put them? What pedagogical possibilities do they obscure? What can our
reliance on this genre tell us about North American music theory and the
commitments or anxieties it carries? Overall: are we right to depend on SATB
writing as we do? In this panel, we seek to engage with these questions by
examining the role of the chorale in the undergraduate theory curriculum and
proposing pedagogical approaches that delay, reconfigure, or replace it.</p>

<p>This panel consists of six papers. The first, a 20-minute paper, will
examine the chorale in contemporary music theory textbooks as a means of
establishing a baseline for current pedagogical practices. Following this
paper, five lightning talks will address curricular implications and pressures
as well as proposals to shift the choraleâ€™s traditional applications.
Panelists draw largely on first-hand experience from various institutional
settings, including a liberal-arts college, a state school, a research
university, a conservatory, and a school of music. Finally, Professor Jennifer
Snodgrass will offer a response, after which those in attendance are invited
to contribute to the discussion.</p>
