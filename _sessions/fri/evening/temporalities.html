<p class="abs-title">Rhythm and Repetition in Gérard Grisey’s <i>Vortex temporum</i></p>
<p class="abs-author">Robert Hasegawa (McGill University)</p>

<p>Gérard Grisey repeatedly drew attention to the central role of time in his music: “For me, spectral music has a temporal origin.” In his compositions, spectrally derived harmonies are a vehicle for the exploration of new kinds of temporal experience. This paper examines Grisey’s approach to musical time in Vortex Temporum (1994–96). Grisey’s program note describes an analogy between the work’s use of three different types of spectrum (harmonic, stretched, and compressed) and three different types of time (ordinary, dilated, and contracted). While previous studies have primarily focused on what Grisey called the “skeleton of time” (an abstract precompositional scheme of durations), this paper uses detailed analysis to engage the “flesh of time”: how the work’s deployment of specific musical materials informs and shapes immediate temporal perception. The theoretical model draws on Grisey’s own rhythmic concepts (as detailed in his article “Tempus ex machina: A composer’s reflections on musical time”) as well as Christopher Hasty’s theory of rhythmic projection.</p>

  Analysis in a Study of Rap </p>

<p>The interactions between meter, phrasing, rhyme, semantics, grammar, and rhythm afford rap a unique brand of poetic musicality. In the hands of skilled M.C.s these elements alternately align to create driving clear patterns of anticipation, or elide and enjamb in complex webs that thwart expectations. Building on existing theory (Adams 2008, 2009; Ohriner 2013), this paper presents a theoretical description of rap flow based on analyses of over 120 popular rap songs. From the corpus a general description of the “norms” of rap are statistically quantified: the most common phrase schemata, rhythms, uses of rhyme, etc. These statistical generalizations are then used as a reference point against which to identify and analyze the most exceptional and creative passages in the corpus. The corpus approach affords a well-defined comparison of the stylistic features of different rappers’ flow, as well as changes in rap flow over time. For instance, the current corpus reveals several historical trends including a significant decrease in the average tempo in rap songs, and an increase in the number of rhymes through the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Using measures from information theory, the complexity and predictability of rap rhyme schemes is quantified in a probabilistic theoretical model. It is shown that skilled rappers alternatively maximize or minimize entropy and unpredictability in their flow, creating the balance between tension and release which is central to musical experience. In addition, an autocorrelational approach is adopted to identify and measure repetition at various time scales in the rap delivery.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Harmonic Schemata and Hypermeter</p>
<p class="abs-author">Danuta Mirka (University of Southampton, UK)</p>

<p>One of the main differences between meter and hypermeter concerns preference factors of metric perception. According to Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff (1983), perception of meter proper is conditioned by phenomenal accents but meter above the bar level is increasingly supplanted by grouping which, at higher levels, is equivalent to phrase structure. The eminent role of phrase structure and harmony in perception of hypermeter was acknowledged by William Rothstein (1995), who dubbed these factors, respectively, the “rule of congruence” and the “rule of harmonic rhythm.” The “rule of texture” was added by Eric McKee (2004) and the “rule of parallelism” reformulated by David Temperley (2001) so as to account for the effect of the first segment in a chain of repetitions. I will posit another preference factor for hypermeter: hypermetrical profiles of harmonic schemata. By contrast to other preference factors, which work “bottom-up” and cue single events as strong, this factor allows for “top-down” processing of hypermeter by mapping the hypermetrical profile of a given schema upon a span of time including several events which can be either strong or weak. If the schema is recognized at a later event, such mapping may change the hypermetrical status of earlier events and lead to forms of metrical reinterpretation not discussed by Rothstein (1989). I will concentrate on the cadential schema and illustrate its effect on hypermeter with examples from Haydn’s string quartets.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Tala and Transformation: A GIS Approach to Metric Conflict in
  South Indian Carnatic Music</p>
<p class="abs-author">Robert Wells (University of South Carolina Upstate)</p>

<p>In recent years, numerous theories have emerged for analyzing metric conflict in Western music, including Krebs (1999), Leong (1999; 2000), and Cohn (1992a; 1992b; 2001). However, conflict between metric layers also plays a heavy role in many non-Western musics, including the rich tradition of South Indian Carnatic music. Central to this tradition is an intricate system of rhythm and meter based on an internalized metric cycle called the tāḷa, which listeners track using standardized hand gestures called kriyas. When a soloist’s performed phrases and rhythmic patterns expressively contradict the tāḷa—a frequent, idiomatic occurrence in Carnatic music—the listener experiences deep metric conflict. While Morris (2000) suggests ways of understanding such contra-tala phrasing, his attempts are primarily speculative rather than analytical. On the other hand, Nelson (1991; 2000; 2008) provides detailed analyses, but without the aid of a rigorous theoretical system.</p>
<p>Thus, this paper seeks to develop a dynamic system for modeling Carnatic meter using the metric generalized interval system (GIS) <i>Met</i> developed by Wells (2013; 2015), which wields the theoretical power of Lewin’s (1987) GIS theory while being adaptable to diverse analytic contexts. The first part of this paper illustrates how Carnatic meter can be effectively modeled using <i>Met</i>. The second part presents a metric analysis of <i>Jagadānandakāraka</i> by renowned Carnatic composer Tyagaraja, showing how metric conflict in the piece’s opening initiates <i>Met</i>-intervallic processes that are closely tied to ongoing rhythmic, motivic, melodic, and textual developments.</p>
