<p class="abs-title">Un-Quin(n)ing Qualia</p>
<p class="abs-author">Max Silva (University of Chicago)</p>

<p>Like philosopher Daniel Dennett’s infamous article “Quining Qualia,” Ian Quinn’s unified theory of chord quality refutes an intuitively obvious truism— namely, that chord quality is determined by interval content. Intervallic measurements sort chords into six rough qualitative categories according to which of the six interval classes predominate. Quinn argues, however, that membership in these categories is actually determined by alignment with an even division of the octave into 1–6 parts, measured by coefficients 1–6 of the chord’s discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Moreover, these coefficients don’t consistently correlate with their associated category’s predominant interval. Paradoxically, interval content turns out to be a symptom rather than a cause of chord quality.</p>
<p>Where would we need to depart from Quinn if we want to preserve our intuitions about the importance of interval? After exploring exactly what phenomenal property the DFT measures and why there is a mismatch between coefficients and intervals, I conclude that the mismatch results from the DFT’s fundamentally spatial conception of chords as objects with shapes. The unquestioned assumption is that <em>chords themselves</em> are necessarily the bearers of quality.</p>
<p>I argue that instead of thinking of chords <em>having</em> quality, we can think of chords <em>giving</em> quality to their constituent pitches. This idea of intervallic context coloring, infusing, and constituting pitches as qualitative objects resonates with work by Hasty, Hirata, Cramer, Väisälä, Hasegawa, and Hanninen. It also suggests an extension of Rings’s transformational methodology beyond tonality to account for intervallic qualia, providing a phenomenologically rich tool for post-tonal analysis.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Shostakovich and “Playing Out”: Centric Set Theory and Polyoctatonicism in the Seventh String Quartet</p>
<p class="abs-author">Dmitri Tymoczko (Princeton University)</p>

<p>Much polytonal music either combines diatonic scale-fragments or diatonic and nondiatonic material. Shostakovich’s seventh string quartet, written shortly after the composer had been exposed to a range of Western avant-garde music, instead involves a strikingly systematic superimposition of <em>octatonic</em> fragments. In my talk I outline three “models” of polyoctatonic combination, detailing how they appear throughout the piece. I also show how Shostakovich recreates familiar procedures (including the “subset technique” from <em>A Geometry of Music</em>) in this unfamiliar musical environment. The result is music with a striking and distinctive aural character, suffused with octatonic subsets while rarely articulating complete octatonic scales, and almost always emphasizing a clear tonal center. This fusion of centricity with something like set theory can be found sporadically throughout twentieth-century music, not least in the improvisations of jazz musicians such as McCoy Tyner. I conclude by suggesting that it represents an interesting intermediary between traditional tonality and complete atonality.</p>


<p class="abs-title">The Tonal Extravagance of Large Pitch Sets</p>
<p class="abs-author">Clifton Callender (Florida State University)</p>

<p>This presentation will discuss the use of large pitch (not pitch-<em>class</em>) sets in contemporary approaches to tonality. In particular, I will focus on non-diatonic scales/chords that typically achieve (near) pitch-class saturation and can project multiple tonal centers in different (and usually overlapping) registers. As one example, Magnus Lindberg’s <em>Corrente</em> is based on a chaconne that cycles through seven twelve-tone scales, each of which can be understood either as a combination of inversionally-combinatorial hexachords or as registrally contiguous sets of six or seven pitches yielding a series of overlapping extended tertian chords and (altered) scales. These large sonorities can also increase the possibilities for smooth voice leading in ways that relate to my previous work on descending chromatic voice leading and jazz harmonies in the music of György Ligeti. In discussing various approaches to the extravagance of tonal possibilities, I will show examples from the broader contemporary repertoire, including works by Witold Lutosławski, Ligeti, Kaija Saariaho, Lindberg, and Thomas Adès (with antecendents in the music of Webern, Messiaen, and Boulez) as well as examples drawn from my own compositions. My hope is to convince those in attendance that these contemporary approaches to tonality (broadly understood) have been used by numerous composers and warrant significantly more analytical attention.</p>

<p class="abs-title">Harmonious Opposition: Maximal Displacement and Voice-Leading Parsimony</p>
<p class="abs-author">Richard James Plotkin (University at Buffalo, SUNY)</p>

<p>A traditional parsimonious transformation must satisfy a single constraint: minimal change of pitch-class content. To limit this transformation within the chromatic universe, two further fruitful-but-arbitrary rules must be followed: set class preservation, and half- or whole-step voice-leading. An alternate formulation of parsimonious transformations, in which the two rules are replaced by constraints involving scales and maximally even distributions, can take us beyond a discussion of the chord cycles usually examined in neo-Riemannian theory. One intriguing product of this reformulation is the opportunity to clearly define an <em>opposite</em> to voice-leading parsimony—<em>maximal displacement</em>. The interaction of these opposing transformations reveals interesting harmonic patterns in the works of Debussy and Chopin. After a discussion of the mathematical foundations of the theory, using iterated quantization and Fourier phase analysis, we will take a detailed look at how these transformations offer a compelling new way to hear Chopin’s Prelude no. 17 in A-flat major.</p>
