<p>While “High Classical” sonata form continues to attract significant analytical attention, formal structures of early- and mid-century two-reprise compositions remain a neglected subject. Yet a fresh examination of this repertoire, in light of recently developed (or rediscovered) analytical paradigms, would provide a broader context for understanding the development of formal procedures throughout the century. Through the analysis of two suite movements by J. S. Bach and a mid-century sonata attributed to Haydn, this study demonstrates that certain procedures associated with sonata form have significant and under-explored precursors in Baroque compositions—namely, that Sonata Theory’s “rotational form” is essentially the same phenomenon as Lester’s has described as “parallel-section construction” in Bach’s music. Both of these may be subsumed within a more basic formal principle: Caplin’s formal functions of beginning-middle-end (adopted after Agawu).</p>
<p>Koch describes a model (<i>Anlage</i>) comprising two reprises but three main periods (<i>Hauptperioden</i>), each ending with a PAC. In Bach’s dances, each <i>Hauptperiode </i>exhibits a subtle but palpable internal structure of three formal functions: (1) an initiating idea (Koch’s “Thema”), (2) medial, modulatory material, and (3) a characteristic ending idea. Particular musical emphasis is placed on the ending idea; all three <i>Hauptperiode</i>-ending cadences are commonly achieved using parallel material that is marked for consciousness (Ratner’s “rhyming cadences”). Each <i>Hauptperiode </i>traces an arc similar to what Sonata Theory calls a “rotation,” the first serving as the paradigm against which the latter two will be heard, and the third tasked with achieving structural closure in the tonic.</p>

<p>Sonata-rondo and other rondo-based forms often resist quick, non-problematic formal identification. One particular juncture in these forms, the return of the refrain (A) following the B section, is sometimes abbreviated before the second episode. This truncation weakens the discrete, sectionalized rhetoric typically seen in a rondo form. In particular, when this second refrain is incomplete (no cadential closure in the tonic), as opposed to abridged (abbreviated but achieving a PAC in the tonic key), the sense of continuity and urgency toward the next section is greatly enhanced. Drawing from final movements cast in rondo-based forms by Haydn, Mendelssohn, and others, this paper will focus exclusively on pieces with <i>incomplete</i> second refrains. In order to examine exactly how the composer diverts the formal train off the tracks, these pieces will be categorized using Caplin’s formal-function theory, pinpointing exactly what part of the refrain theme diverges. Those diverging within a presentation phrase are designated “instant” and those diverging within a later portion, such as a continuation, are categorized as “internal.” Techniques of divergence are then established, including modal mixture and fragmentation/sequencing. Although this issue of abbreviated refrains as related to voice-leading structure has been discussed in Hunt (2014), the analytical examples in this study focus more on the form-function digression techniques in terms of William Caplin’s groundbreaking formal-function theory. In particular, Caplin’s concept of “tight-knit” versus “loosened” thematic components proves ideal to evaluate whether a refrain has loosening elements from the start, which are then used in the (incomplete) second refrain’s digression.</p>

  Generation and Reduction in Eighteenth-Century Music</p>

<p>My paper examines some of the generative and reductive aspects of Gjerdingen’s (1988, 2007) schemata. I discuss the intersection of Gjerdingen’s schemata and the Rule of the Octave (hereafter: RO). Gjerdingen’s schemata are compelling, style-specific outer-voice skeletons for eighteenth-century music. The RO, a template for harmonizing scalar patterns in the bass, has drawn considerable scholarly attention (Christensen 1992, Holtmeier 2007, Gjerdingen 2007, Byros 2009, Sanguinetti 2012). I argue that the overlap between the schemata and the RO is considerable and that part of the stylistic information encapsulated in the schemata is related to generating a skeletal soprano in response to the input of a bass segment and associated RO sonorities. By examining principles underlying the construction of such grammatical soprano lines, I speculate on potential well-formed strings that are absent from the schemata and from the style. I claim that such strings are rejected from the style due to global formal function or syntax (Caplin 1998, Byros <i>Hauptruhepuncte</i>). While the schemata encapsulate a great deal of style-specific information necessary to generate music in the eighteenth-century style, they do not contain information regarding surface diminutions. However, the analyst’s explicit task, attempting to model the period listener’s tacit schema recognition, moves from a musical surface to a schematic skeleton. I offer an initial recasting of the schemata as reduction rules for finding the head of a time span (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983), based on contrapuntal and metric relations between the outer voices within a metric segment.</p>
