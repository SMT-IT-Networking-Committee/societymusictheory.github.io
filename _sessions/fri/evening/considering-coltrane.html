<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>From the mid-1950s until his death fifty years ago in 1967, John
Coltrane progressed through three vastly different style periods.  This
special session highlights the multifaceted nature of his career by
drawing on a wide range of methodologies.  The six papers of the session
break into three pairs of presentations, each occupying a one-hour block
of time with its own discussion period.</p>

<p>Our initial pair of papers focuses on historical and textual analysis.
Rich Pellegrin utilizes reductive and transformational approaches to help
inform our understanding of Coltrane’s overall career trajectory.  Barry
Long examines Coltrane’s usage of text as musical device and the impact
this had on subsequent black activism, focusing on his recording of
“Alabama.”</p>

<p>The second hour of the session features detailed analyses of music from
Coltrane’s middle and late periods. Brian Levy uses original
transcriptions of “Pursuance” and “Miles’ Mode” to investigate the complex
rhythmic and harmonic interactions among the members of the Coltrane
Quartet.  John O’Gallagher examines Coltrane’s late music—often assumed to
be “free”—through the lens of set theory, demonstrating how pieces such as
“Saturn” and “Iris” are in fact highly organized.</p>

<p>The papers in our third hour employ new and original software to
observe, analyze, and illustrate numerous subtleties of Coltrane’s music.
Klaus Frieler approaches Coltrane’s work by comparing it computationally
and statistically with that of Miles Davis.  Milton Mermikides analyzes
micro-rhythmic aspects of Coltrane’s music via original software which
capitalizes upon recent developments in digital technology and rhythmic
perception research.</p>
