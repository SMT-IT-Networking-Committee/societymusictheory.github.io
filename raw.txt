"A-Five, Six, Seven, Eight!": Musical Counting and Dance Hemiolas in Musical Theatre Tap Dance Breaks
“A-five, six, seven, eight!” Those four numbers in the opening of <i>A Chorus Line</i> (1976) often announce the beginning of musical theatre dance routines. Choreographic phrases often follow an 8-beat paradigm to match the larger musical hypermeter. However, more complex rhythmic structures are commonly found in Broadway choreography, where steps and groups of steps do not closely align with musical phrases. These “Dance Hemiolas,” as I term them, usually occur near places of formal delineation in the music. Tap dancing intensifies this potential metric “dissonance” (following Krebs, 1999) as sounds created by the dancers’ shoes create another rhythmic instrumental layer. Changes in the relationships between the metrical layers can create heightened energy. This paper explores examples from two Broadway-style tap dance breaks to show how Dance Hemiolas combine with musical rhythms to generate momentum and delineate formal structures.
In the 1992 musical <i>Crazy For You</i> with music by George Gershwin, Susan Stroman’s choreography uses traditional tap dance steps in classic and new ways, featuring many Dance Hemiolas at structural positions. In the finale to <i>Billy Elliot Live</i> (2005/2014), the rousing conclusion of the dance break is created by accumulating dancers, repetition of groups of simple steps, and Dance Hemiolas. These examples show how dancers’ on-stage movements and rhythmic tap sounds combine with musical rhythms and phrases to create energy and strengthen structural climaxes. By showing analytical insights gained from a closer look at choreo-musical rhythmic movements, this paper offers an innovative investigative tool for scholars who seek multivalent understanding.

Choreographic Revelations:
“Dance Music,”According to Two Historical Dance Theorists
When it plays a role in musical analysis at all, dance often serves as an imaginary enhancement of a primarily musical experience. For instance, topical analysis interprets “dance” topoi as sonic cues that invoke the memory or specter of courtly dance to expressively animate instrumental or vocal music. Even some choreo-musical analyses tend to portray dance as a commentary or “visualization” of the score—an auxiliary to the music itself. But what would musicians and audiences learn if we were to turn this perspective on its head?
In this talk, I consult the treatises of two influential dance theorists—Carlo Blasis (1797–1878) and Fyodor Lopukhov (1886–1973)—to reposition the analysis of dance and its musical accompaniment through a primarily choreographic lens. While roughly a century separates the two authors, both discuss “classical” ballet technique and choreography in terms that may seem at once familiar and unsettling to musicians. Through examples of standard ballet class exercises and excerpts from <i>Giselle</i>, <i>La Bayadère</i>, and <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, I highlight instances in which Blasis and Lopukhov have appropriated musical concepts and nomenclature (e.g. "adagio," "petit allegro," and even "sonata form") to delineate strictly choreographic elements and processes. As a foil to established analytical methods, where music recalls or contains imagined dances, these two dance theorists offer an appealing counterpoint: that choreographed dance contains—and dictates—imagined “music.”

Finding the Salsa Beat from the Positional Perspective
of the Dancing Salsero/a
In their 2007 study, Phillips-Silver/Trainor demonstrated how physical movement has the power to shape aural perception of meter, showing that it was not enough to observe physical movement; in order for participants to hear an aural stimulus in the meter of a given movement pattern, they had to embody it themselves. Following other recent attempts to broaden how music theorists approach analysis, this paper investigates ways in which a dancer’s unique listening perspective provides insights into the musical structure of salsa songs—insights that would not be made without such an embodied experience. To illustrate this approach, I will examine the song “Yaye Boy” in some detail. The initial lack of percussion in Cuban group Orquesta Aragón’s arrangement highlights the metric ambiguity of the opening melodic line, making the interpretive job of the dancer particularly difficult as none of the musical accents align with the entry points of the possible basic footwork patterns. While NY/Senegalese group Africando’s arrangement clarifies the location of the downbeat, supporting the ambiguous melodic line with the interlocking percussion patterns typical of salsa, this arrangement soon highlights a larger-scale hypermetric irregularity in the song’s phrase lengths. Because the footwork pattern is a hypermetric cycle spanning two measures of music, dancers are acutely aware of and affected by disruptions in phrase structure. Through their physical interactions with such frequently occurring moments of disorientation in salsa, dancers may either increase the tension of or help to reconcile metric conflicts, adding exciting interpretive layers to the art form.

Four Steps Toward Parnassus: Johann David Heinichen's
Method of Keyboard Improvisation as a Model of
Baroque Compositional Pedagogy
Johann David Heinichen’s treatise, <i>Der General-Bass in der Composition</i> (Dresden, 1728), is the most comprehensive study of thoroughbass ever written, yet it has been continually overshadowed in historical accounts by two works published in the same decade: Rameau’s <i>Traité de l’Harmonie</i> (1722) and Fux’s <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i> (1725). Despite receiving some attention by Buelow (1966) and Holtmeier (2007), it seems <i>Der General-Bass</i> has yet to receive wider acclaim because it lacks a reductive pedagogical framework that can rival Rameau’s <i>basse fondamentale</i> or Fux’s species in simplicity and immediate appeal. Fortunately, the “partimento renaissance” of the last decade has brought renewed attention to the centrality of thoroughbass in 18th-century music-making. Thus, the time is ripe for a reappraisal of Heinichen’s monumental work. At least once, Heinichen does in fact outline a pedagogical method of eminent simplicity on par with Rameau’s and Fux’s theories: his four-step instruction in how to improvise a prelude at the keyboard. These four steps toward Parnassus build in complexity by permuting two factors: (1) conjunct vs. disjunct basslines with (2) consonant vs. dissonant harmonies. According to Heinichen, this method, which seems to be completely unknown today, is to be understood not only as instruction in improvising, but also as training for beginning composers. Therefore, in explicating the pedagogy of one of 18th-century Europe’s leading composer-theorists, this paper makes a contribution to both the historically-informed analysis and the practical instruction of baroque music today.

Beethoven Contra Partimento: Creativity, Aesthetics,
and the <i>schöne Künste</i> in a Realization of BWV 908
The international “new theory” (Sanguinetti 2014) formed of schemata and partimenti has painted a powerful picture of musical creativity in the long 18th century, one centered on the close imitation of models. The Neapolitan conservatories and Italian diaspora have placed partimento schooling especially center stage. The coherence of this picture, however, owes to generalizations about the whole (creativity) from a particular (craft-training). My paper problematizes 18th-century musical creativity by positioning Beethoven, as composer and metaphor for a German tradition, in counterpoint with the world of partimento in two interrelated ways: one aesthetic-philosophical, the other practical.
The creative mechanism advanced by the “new theory” is foreign to the musical aesthetics and values into which Beethoven was born: the creative process has been described in terms of “automatic composition” (Sanguinetti 2012), “transcription” (Gjerdingen 2007), and “memes going viral” (Gjerdingen and Bourne 2015). Meanwhile, Beethoven’s earliest training with Christian Gottlob Neefe in Bonn is reflected in Johann Georg Sulzer’s <i>Allgemeine Theorie</i> (1771–74). Its creative and aesthetic categories, which include “originality,” “invention,” and “variety” in “unity,” are values that Neefe (1783, 1785) “put in [Beethoven’s] hands” at a young age, along with <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>.
Drawing on the “historical imagination” (Treitler 1989), I creatively imagine how Beethoven might have implemented Sulzer’s aesthetic categories in a realization of Bach’s partimento-fantasia from BWV 908, and how this differs from modern partimento-trained solutions and the first published realization by Carl Czerny (1839). Differences among these realizations throw dichotomies within 18th-century musical thought into sharp relief.


Andrew Malilay White (University of Chicago)
Teaching by Example: “Practical” Pedagogies of the
Postclassical Thoroughbass
Is it possible to learn thoroughbass without memorizing any written rules? This paper examines two Viennese thoroughbass treatises that lack any written rules: Simon Sechter’s <i>Generalbass-Schule</i> (1835) and Carl Czerny’s <i>Studien zur praktischen Kenntniss aller Accorde des Generalbasses</i> (1854). Instead of listing rules and providing skeletal basslines, the treatises present only fully-realized chord progressions—and in Czerny’s case, even some exercises that could be described as idiomatic piano etudes. This represents an approach to thoroughbass pedagogy that I term the “practical thoroughbass,” which I claim played a driving role in determining the post-classical musical style. The students of Sechter and Czerny (who include Schubert and Liszt) may owe their flashiest and most idiosyncratic effects to the practical thoroughbass.
Using the language of cognitive skill acquisition, this paper describes how the two treatises differ in method from the more familiar 18th-century partimento tradition. Unlike their 18th-century precursors, Sechter and Czerny do not need their readers to become adept at realizing a bass with figures. But despite this dissimilarity, the practical thoroughbass and the partimento tradition share the goal of turning thoroughbass rules into a broad structure for elaboration. I then show how Sechter and Czerny musically prioritize two aspects of skill acquisition: example-centeredness and generalization. The practical thoroughbass represents just one position in a century-long debate over whether thoroughbass was a performerly skill, a compositional theory, or some hybrid of both.

Hearing the Inaudible in Dutilleux's <i>Métaboles</i>
The French term <i>métabole</i> is most often used today to designate metamorphosing insects, but it has several interesting historical definitions, such as (1) a rhetorical device in which a word reappears within a passage but is in some way altered, and (2) a musical operation, such as a metrical shift or a modal modulation. In addition to repeatedly characterizing his 1964 orchestral work<i> Métaboles</i> in terms of one or another of these definitions, Dutilleux emphasized the potential for such transformations to generate “real” or “essential” change. In one interview, he even outlines a precise mechanism: “A certain sound event, sometimes very brief and unidentifiable in the moment,” he explains, “will settle in the unconscious of the listener and play its role <i>a posteriori</i>.” In this paper, I argue that <i>Métaboles </i>enacts a comparable process and that Dutilleux’s idiosyncratic use of the 12-tone method is crucial to its execution. More specifically, I argue that, in the final movement’s reprise, the row becomes a catalyst that sends shock waves throughout the piece, forcing a retrospective reconsideration of everything that came before. I first interpret the opening movement in terms of collections, inversional relations, voice leading patterns, etc., and then move on to describing the properties of the row, which is derived from set-class (016) and strongly suggests interaction with an ic1/6 Tonnetz. Finally, I show how the reprise’s relation to this construct reveals a surprising connection between it and the rest of the piece, including the very opening.

Competing Musical Processes in Parisian Modernist Sonata Forms
The first movements of Milhaud’s Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Clarinet and Piano, Ravel’s Sonata for Violin and Piano, and Martinů’s Sextet for Winds and Piano are in sonata form with truncated recapitulation, that is, they begin with normative sonata expositions but their recapitulations do not produce the secondary theme. This violates the most basic norm of sonata form, but whereas this would register as a catastrophic deformation in a 19th-century work, these three Parisian-modernist pieces are not cataclysmic in affect and all blithely end in the major mode.
This paper demonstrates that these pieces feature goal-directed processes, running in parallel to sonata-form logic, which complete with the reprise of the first theme; the resultant sense of resolution allows the remaining sonata-form exigencies to be discarded. In the Ravel, the process is a macroharmonic one, wherein the first theme returns without the octatonicism that suffused the exposition. In the Milhaud, the primary theme is reprised without the bitonal clash that marked its initial appearance. In the Martinů, the process is an accumulative one, wherein signifiers of a jazz style are slowly introduced until they accrete into a concentrated evocation of jazz. This novel approach to sonata form spotlights the Parisian-modernist interest in “neoclassical” formal traditions and the ironic distance with which those traditions could be treated; it also forms an intriguing parallel with modernist notions of counterpoint between the arts in multimedia works, and enriches both theories of form and conceptions of the musical work as the intersection of independent compositional parameters.

Falling into Ruin: Neoclassical Sonata Form
In France, after the First World War, sonata-form structures of the 18th century were revived and reimagined within the context of neoclassicism. A new neoclassical sonata form was born: a structure designed to crumble and fail. This paper explores French sonata-form movements of the 1920s as structures of ruin—movements that not only pay homage to the sonata forms of the past, but also bear the scars left by the passage of time.
To demonstrate neoclassical French sonata form, I examine the large-scale form of the first movement of three representative neoclassical works: Milhaud’s Sonatine for Flute (1922), Poulenc’s Trio for Oboe, Bassoon and Piano (1926), and Ravel’s Sonata for Violin No. 2 (1923–27). My approach is based on Caplin’s form-functional theory (1998) but, because of the post-tonal nature of the pieces, I apply form-functional principles to melody in order to determine beginning, middle, and ending functions.
My analyses reveal that neoclassical sonata form is deformational (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006). “Failures” of formal structure are actually moments of expressive power. In these works, the clarity of formal functions, the boundaries of thematic areas, and the order of the thematic material disintegrates once a sonata-form structure has been suggested. By the onset of the recapitulation, each movement has already fallen into ruin: formal units are missing; themes are compressed; and new material outside of the sonata form appears. Ultimately, the beauty of neoclassical sonata form lies in its crumbling structure: a structure that simultaneously acknowledges the past and the present.

John Roeder (University of British Columbia)
World Music as a Resource for Teaching Music Theory
When learning outcomes are framed independently of a particular repertoire, music theory syllabi can comfortably accommodate musical diversity. Essays by Tenzer and Clendinning, responding to recent disciplinary deliberations, have suggested some ways to include “non-canonical” world music in the classroom, but more can be done. There are many good reasons to expose university students to diverse music, but it seems especially important for them to learn basic principles that many musics share.
In a first-year theory course I teach, we consider how pulse and meter, grouping structure and functions, pitch focus and hierarchy, and voice interactions in various textures can shape musical time. The syllabus provides a basis for analyzing “canonical” tonal and post-tonal repertoire covered in later courses, but it also supports close hearings of “non-canonical” music. Indeed, in the latter, fundamental rhythmic and melodic processes are often more salient than in art- or popular-music textures governed by harmonic and contrapuntal constraints.
In this talk I discuss how three examples of world music contribute to this pedagogical program: a layered Balinese gamelan cycle, a zither-flute duet from the Chinese silk-and-bamboo repertoire, and a melody played by a Bolivian panpipe orchestra. Although they originate in cultural contexts unfamiliar to most students, they are readily accessible. And they all employ the basic processes I cover in the course, often through strikingly similar procedures, such as interlocking patterns, melodic elaboration, motivic transformation, and collectional completion. Appreciating these shared procedures will help students understand the music(s) they eventually choose to concentrate on.

Including Music by Diverse Composers:
Redefining Modes of Analysis
There are many compelling reasons to be inclusive and to diversify the composers we study in classrooms. Significant efforts have been made in recent years by scholars to broaden the repertoire that we consider either as textbook music examples or as pieces for close analysis in scholarly works.  The broadening of the “canon” has been such a collective effort that we have begun to see the effects in textbooks, dissertation topics, conference papers and scholarly journals. As we continue the endeavor to diversify the composers we study by gender, sexuality, genre, nationality, culture, race, etc., this paper suggests that we can also consider this as an opportunity to achieve profound results from another angle. Theory and analysis as a field of study could be broadened by cultivating analytical approaches that are germane to the aesthetic and musical practices of works by diverse composers. This paper considers two such examples: how the notion of timbre and the notion of temporality could be complicated by analyzing music by Ruth Crawford and Tan Dun. It will be argued that incorporating works by diverse composers not only broadens the scope or diversifies the repertoire we study, it also opens up new theoretical inquiries and identifies and defines musical parameters in a fresh light—perspectives that are just as important but have heretofore received little attention in the general field of music theory. In other words, it helps us diversify and redefine what can be considered as valid and valuable modes of analysis.

Robin Attas (Queen’s University)
Working with Diverse Student Populations in the Classroom
Music theory instructors may feel compelled to consider diversity in the classroom for personal reasons or because of departmental or institutional initiatives. They may also be motivated by broader educational trends both inside and outside music theory. For instance, the field of music theory continues to engage in discussions about curricular reform. Further, as public funding for elementary and high school music education is an ongoing struggle, incoming music majors may not have the skills once assumed to be basic. Finally, many universities in North America and Europe are recruiting increasing numbers of international students and improving access to education for equity-seeking groups. All of these trends may change the typical student abilities and worldviews that instructors encounter in their classrooms, necessitating an increased attention to diversity in music theory pedagogy.
This paper will define diversity broadly in order to propose a range of practical and concrete actions. A discussion of general principles of inclusivity, equity, diversity, and universal design for learning will lead to applications in a range of teaching situations where an attention to diversity can impact classroom teaching, including classroom dynamics, instructional strategies, course content, assessment, and course design. The paper will conclude with a list of practical strategies for instructors in diverse institutional contexts and career stages. Ultimately, this paper advocates for an increased sense of humanity in the classroom; that is, for instructors and students alike to see and celebrate the diversity of human beings learning alongside one another.

HISTORY OF THEORY AND
THE PRE-HISTORY OF MUSIC (HARRISON)
David Cohen (Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics), Chair

Joshua Klopfenstein (University of Chicago)
Heinrich Glarean, Jakob Paix, and the Problem of Polyphonic Mode
Theorizing mode in polyphony was a major concern for 16th-century theorists. These same questions have attracted significant attention from musicologists, especially following Harold Powers (1981, 1982, 1992). Gregory Barnett argues, “The modes are poor analytical tools, but they are rich in cultural significance. Each variant theory reflects a slightly different Renaissance-era world-view that is translated into musical terms” (Barnett 2013, 183). Jakob Paix puts forth a unique variant of modal theory. In 1589 the German organist Paix applied the 12-mode system from Heinrich Glarean’s <i>Dodecachordon</i> (1547) to a practical keyboard print, the <i>Thesaurus motetarum</i>. This keyboard intabulation of vocal works, purportedly in chronological order, gives each piece a single modal designation, often alongside direct quotation of Glarean’s modal descriptions. Paix’s modal labeling stands at some distance from Glarean’s and gives insight not only into Paix’s conception of mode but also hints toward a larger humanistic project that extends beyond the relatively modest claims that the print explicitly makes. I argue that this print positions Paix as not only an editor and composer but also as a learned theorist. Following Sarah Fuller (1996) and Cristle Collins Judd (2000) on Glarean’s ideological underpinnings, I argue that Paix tries to co-opt Glarean’s humanism, learning, and cultural capital and use it as his own. Though Paix’s display of erudition has more style than substance at points, his modal labels display a unique approach to the problem of mode in polyphony, one that is often flexible and intuitive yet sometimes convoluted and questionable.





Bella Brover-Lubovsky (Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance)
Francescantonio Calegari and the Scuola dei rivolti:
A Bridge between the Prima and Seconda pratica?
The treatment of dissonance—the cornerstone of the distinction between the prima and seconda pratica—by common consent is considered to be regulated by the purely musical context in the former versus the priority given to expressive-rhetorical considerations in the latter style. The theories and compositions by Francescantonio Calegari (1656–1742) challenge this common belief: his treatise <i>Ampla dimostrazione degli armoniali musicali tuoni</i> (1732) and his arrangements of the music of Cinquecento masters shed light on his genuine views of the treatment of dissonance with its inversions (known as the scuola dei rivolti).
The Berlin Sing Akademie Archive contains the most representative collection of Calegari’s autograph arrangements of works by Palestrina, Asola, and other authors; it displays his keen interest in analyzing vertical sonorities and their succession in various modal contexts, with an emphasis on the correlation between the dissonances and emotionally laden words in the text.
The most obvious element Calegari drew from the study of Palestrina’s works was combining dissonances with their consonant resolutions, thus creating very particular sonorities. He stated: “Whoever wants to write in the modern harmonic style must understand the old style. The theories expressed here are founded in the practice of Palestrina. Through these, one can now utilize the principles of the old school with the new modern taste.”
Exploring Calegari’s theoretical premises vis-à-vis his analyses of old polyphonic works and his own surviving compositions calls into question our confidence in the unambiguous distinction between the place of dissonance in Prima versus Seconda pratica traditions.

Miriam Piilonen (Northwestern University)
Music and Language in Herbert Spencer's Evolutionary Thought
In this presentation I examine Victorian evolutionary theorist Herbert Spencer’s famous injunction, “All music is originally vocal.” In <i>The Origin and Function of Music</i> (1857), Spencer tracked a “progressive” line of ascent from simple vocal exclamations, to complex speech, and finally to music. Charles Darwin claimed oppositely that music evolved into language. Spencer’s vision of musical progress tracks with his conception of a dynamic capacity for emotional expression that is specific to the human species. The Spencerian idea that sonic expressivity evolved teleologically from simplicity to complexity, and from homogeneousness to heterogeneousness, reflects Spencer’s more general theory of evolutionary progress and anticipates modernist aesthetic ideologies.
My interest in Spencer’s music theory is less cosmological and more ethical. I probe what constitutes musical personhood for Spencer, as well as the kinds of sociocultural realities that can be formulated on the basis of theories like his. Voice is key here; for Spencer, voice is the fulcrum of language and music, exemplifying a broader physiological link between emotion and muscular movement. I highlight his sense that words evolved from vocal imitations of the phenomenal world, and I locate Spencer within a historical mimological tradition, alongside thinkers like Plato, Leibniz, John Locke, and Max Müller. “Mimologics” is Gérard Genette’s term for ideas about language that invoke a mimetic origin or function; I introduce Genette’s ideas for a music theory audience. Finally, I bring Spencer’s conception of an unmediated link between voice and emotional expression into contact with contemporary evolutionary musicology in order to assess the mimologics latent within present-day evolutionary music theories.

A Neurocognitive Approach to Modeling Cross-Sensory
Perception in Music and Multimedia
<i>Crossmodal associations</i> are nonarbitrary relationships that the brain draws between features or dimensions of different sensory modes. Examples include audio-visual associations such as loudness-brightness and pitch-height. The brain also recognizes <i>intramodal associations</i> between features of the same sensory mode, such as pitch-tempo and brightness-angularity. Modal associations have become an important topic in cognitive neuroscience and psychology because of the significant influence they have on perception and the broad implications for this research outside of those fields. In music, these associations offer a means for describing analytical relationships between both musical and multimedia parameters. However, because of the specific nature of these studies, which often focus on only one parameter in a single context, it is difficult even for interdisciplinary researchers familiar with this work to navigate and apply modal associations in a broader way to analysis.
This paper synthesizes relevant research from the cognitive literature and presents a tool for modeling multiple crossmodal and intramodal relationships within a single metric space. I begin by presenting an interactive online resource created for analysts to reference modal associations by parameter and find other known relationships. Based on shared features and transitive and reciprocal relationships, I argue that these associations can be broadly sorted into three categories or dimensions, and modeled using an analytical tool I’ve created called the Crossmodal and Intramodal Association (CIA) Model. I close by discussing some of the implications of congruent and incongruent associations and potential applications to analysis, composition, and performance.
These affordances suggest further connections with phenomenological and cognitive theories of multistability (Idhe 2012, Karpinski 2012). By examining relationships between melodies in terms of these multistable possibilities, I offer a more sensitive account of the contour relations listeners may perceive within the music, providing a better understanding of Reich’s minimalist process.

The Analytical Lightshow: Concert Lighting as Analysis in
Extreme Metal Live Performance
Lightshows at contemporary rock concerts generally create an immersive, multi-sensory experience. Their most sophisticated variants, however, provide a visual analysis of the music as it unfolds. This paper presents a case study of the analytical lightshow, by examining how the intricate lightshows of extreme metal band Meshuggah contribute an interpretive layer that not only promotes multi-sensory engagement, but also actively guides listeners through songs’ formal structures.
Theorists (Pieslak 2007; Capuzzo 2018; Lucas 2018) have analyzed Meshuggah’s idiosyncratic approach to rhythmic complexity. By reading Meshuggah’s lightshows as immanent visual analysis, this paper bears out Lochhead’s exploration of “sonic meaning as informed by sight” (2006, 67), and shows how lighting design can mediate between musical complexity and listeners’ engagement.
Meshuggah’s lightshows are exhaustively synchronized to the rhythmic patterns of the guitars and drums; meticulous use of color, brightness, directionality, placement pattern, and beam movement provide additional information about gesture, articulation, and pitch. My analyses, supported by lighting designer Edvard Hansson’s digital models of the lightshow and by video playback, align salient features of the lightshows with transcriptions, showing both how closely their rhythmic contents align, and how riff attributes are enhanced by lighting.
Meshuggah’s analytical lightshows provide a three-dimensional visual score that dramatizes rhythms while guiding listeners through each riff. By presenting analysis and performance simultaneously and as each other, Meshuggah combines technical virtuosity with rock authenticity, and provides another example of what Lucas (2014) calls “coercive synesthesia,” as the lighting becomes an inextricable part of the musical experience.

Like "Daft Punk on bloody C R A C K":
Constructing the Identity of the Virtual Reality DJ
In many virtual reality (VR) experiences, the identity inhabited by the user is at least as if not more important than the gameplay itself. For example, the VR game <i>Electronauts</i> (Survios 2018) invites its user to take on the persona of a futuristic space-DJ. However, a cursory foray into the game quickly reveals its myriad constraints, which exercise a significant influence over what music a user can create. And yet player reviews seem to suggest a lack of awareness regarding these limits. Indeed, users take full ownership over the music created using <i>Electronauts</i>, claiming the game makes them feel like “a real DJ.”<i> Electronauts</i> facilitates this identification with the DJ persona by building DJ aesthetic practices (largely theorized by Mark Butler (2014) and Yara Sellin (2005)) into the interface itself.
I argue that VR technology opens up new avenues of user engagement by providing a hyper-immersive experience of identification, moving beyond virtual performance to the construction of a virtual creative identity. Rather than the music working to support a visual medium, as is common in film or video games, <i>Electronauts</i> exhibits how music can in a sense be the medium, facilitating the embodied experience of identification. By providing the experience of truly “feeling like a DJ,” <i>Electronauts</i> invites its users to take ownership of the music created within the game—as one user states: “if you like music, and REALLY wanna feel like a DJ or Daft Punk on bloody C R A C K download this.”

Strategic Incompletion in Clara Schumann's Lieder
The abstract notion of “completion” is a central concern for many approaches to music analysis. We regularly speak of the completion of formal sections, the completion of motivic processes, the completion of narrative journeys, aggregate completion, and so on. Accordingly, the strategic use of musical incompletion, and purposeful avoidance of the completion of a fundamental musical idea, would be a marked musical event, one that could effectively portray similarly marked aspects of a given poetic text. In this paper I examine two songs by Clara Schumann (1819–96) that explore the notion of strategic incompletion of the fundamental structure in two interesting ways: (1) delaying the first appearance of the tonic harmony until nearly the end of the song through an expanded auxiliary cadence, and (2) establishing the tonic harmony early on as expected but concluding the song on the structural dominant, resulting in a “permanent interruption” (see Latham 2008).
By purposefully suppressing aspects of the fundamental structure through the devices mentioned here, music can become charged with dramatic tension and rich with expressive potential. These two techniques represent opposite ends of a spectrum, one concerned with incompletion directed at the beginning of the fundamental structure, the other with incompletion directed at its conclusion. More generally, composers may draw upon the abstract notion of strategic incompletion to depict any number of musico-poetic sentiments in a song.

Fragments and Frames in the Early Romantic Era
Goehr (2015) contends that the work-concept wholly transformed the prelude, so that “the practice of preparatory preluding became the art of a Romantic prelude already prepared” (8). By definition, the prelude is both incomplete and merely functional, used by performers to ready themselves for the main event. But, Goehr argues, this utilitarian status was tenuous from the very outset, for the moment the prelude was too interesting, it threatened to upstage the main event and shed its preparatory identity (10). How does this paradox relate to the introduction, another kind of “preparatory” music? In other words, how do introductions deny their inherently marginal quality? I respond to this question by comparing three compositions: Felix Mendelssohn’s String Quartet in A Minor, op. 13 (1827) and the opening movements of Robert Schumann’s Piano Sonata in F-sharp Minor, op. 11 (1835) and Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel’s String Quartet in E-flat (1834). My analytical framework focuses on three intersecting levels: the individual work’s formal attributes, intertextual relationships, and the aesthetic trends that inform a variety of beginning strategies. I draw on Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) and Caplin’s (1998) theories of classical form augmented by important perspectives on early 19th-century form (Daverio 1993; Schmalfeldt 2011; and Vande Moortele 2017). Analytical comparison of these opening procedures shows the relevance of the Romantic <i>tendenz</i> toward fragment in these increasingly independent introductions.

Tracing the Second Theme Narrative in
Fanny Hensel's Piano Trio in D Minor
The 19th century was a time for formal innovation. As recent scholarship contends, what once would have been deformational quickly became normative, pushing composers to experiment further. Though the bulk of Hensel’s compositions are songs and short piano pieces, her few larger works demonstrate progressive techniques that align with current explorations of Romantic-era form studies. In this presentation, I look at how the open-ended secondary theme in the first movement of Hensel’s Piano Trio affects significant structural moments and how this impacts the traditional sonata narrative. In effect, I show how this theme, along with its cyclic return in the finale, culminates to provide both thematic and structural closure in the Piano Trio’s deployment of sonata form.
The first movement departs from the second theme, unresolved by moving immediately to contrasting material in the parallel minor, leaving the EEC and ESC to be achieved by a third theme. The finale’s secondary theme likewise struggles to find resolution, recalling the primary theme to achieve the EEC. We hear familiar material prior to the recapitulation’s structural close: the unresolved secondary theme from the first movement. The restatement of this material at the conclusion of the fourth movement highlights a cyclic return, and establishes a contrasting narrative to Hensel’s other sonata movements.
Further analysis on Hensel’s works may explore other hallmarks of early 19th-century formal construction, providing both a path for future examination of idiosyncratic formal constructs and an expansion of current discussion of Fanny Hensel’s catalogue.

Anti-Telos Choruses in Recent Pop
Reports of the chorus’s death have been increasing in pop-critical circles. Indeed, after decades of “don’t bore us, get to the chorus,” many recent pop songs place their focus away from their choruses, subverting normative formal models and opening up space for teleological climax to occur elsewhere. One particular subversive technique pervades post-2010 pop music: after a textural buildup in a verse and prechorus, the chorus begins with a sudden and extreme drop in energy, negating any release of tension and making the chorus the song’s point of lowest energy. In this paper, I investigate the hermeneutics of these "anti-telos choruses," drawing analytical examples from Top-40 hits of the current decade.
Anti-telos choruses in general serve two expressive purposes. First, they engender a sense of intimacy between song persona and listener. Drawing on Allan Moore’s concept of proxemics (2012) and Asaf Peres’s "sonic functions" (2016), I demonstrate that anti-telos choruses employ sonic techniques associated with closeness, such as removing reverb from the vocal line, omitting any accompaniment in the voice’s pitch range, and using a soft and quiet singing style. Second, anti-telos choruses open up space for other sections to act as a song’s energetic peak, thus threatening the chorus’s status as a climactic focal point. My discussion ultimately demonstrates how form is not just a basic template for song design but an inherently expressive feature of pop songs.

"...a jolly good time": Understanding Groove in Progressive Rock
Progressive rock is characterized by scholars and music critics as a genre that emphasizes the mind over the body, such that it is “not about music for dancing” (Macan 1997), but rather designed for careful listening. When groove-based sections do occur, they often feature complex rhythms or meters that “[lessen] the music’s bodily appeal, calling for thought about rhythm rather than immediate participation in it” (Stone 2016). Other scholars, however, have argued that prog fans do engage with this music bodily, suggesting that the phenomenon of groove in prog deserves further exploration.
While previous scholarship on metrically complex grooves has discussed their structural features or their signification of artistic seriousness, I focus on how musical elements model the process by which listeners might learn how to entrain to these grooves. Prog songs frequently feature teleological processes in which “difficult” grooves are repeated until they become contextually stable in a sequence that may span multiple formal units. Similarly, textural modifications likewise counterbalance rhythmic and metric complexity, creating a narrative arc that rewards the learning of complex temporal patterns. Through several analytical vignettes, I demonstrate how the “groove-learning process” enacted in these songs interacts with text and formal structure. Thus, these grooves provide insight into how “music for listening” may be rendered danceable.

Extended Final Phrases in Popular Songs
As analysts and listeners, we place special importance on closure at the ends of tonal works. There are many theoretical and analytical considerations of this issue in art music, but few in popular music, and most of those focus on harmonic structures. The roles of phrase rhythm and hypermeter in creating closure in popular songs has been little explored. This paper examines a closing technique discussed by Kirnberger and other 18th-century theorists that persists in 20th-century popular songs, whereby the last statement of a regular four-bar phrase is extended by one or more bars. In modern terms, this extension often shifts the final bar of the phrase from a hypermetrically weak position to a strong one, increasing the sense of closure. This technique helps to differentiate the final section (which is often a chorus) from its earlier iterations, and resembles the end-accented “closing-theme schema” discussed by Temperley and Ng. Final phrases can be extended and end-weighted through three basic techniques, which may be used alone or in combination: composed-out decelerations, extensions of the cadential progression, and internal repetitions. The high degree of repetition, short length of repeated units, and prevalence of open-ended formal sections in popular songs render the issue of closure more problematic than in art music. This paper demonstrates that 20th-century popular songwriters sometimes adopted a much older strategy for achieving conclusive endings, and suggests that phrase structure and hypermeter in popular songs are less regular than has been generally assumed.

Damaged Cargo: Concerning the Unfortunate Voyage of Classical Poetic Theory to the Land of the Modern Music-Theory Textbook
Music theory textbooks share a consensus definition of meter, which is directly appropriated from the late 18th century. I identify several problems with the definition, from the standpoint of modern metric research. I propose that the problems result from a three-stage process of transmission, whose origin is the ancient Greek theory of poetic verse feet, and whose intermediate stages are 18th-century theory of poetic prosody, and 18th-century theory of (mostly) vocal music. At each stage, the source has considerable prestige within the culture of the target domain. This encourages an uncritical adoption ("shoehorning") of features that fit poorly with the repertories being modelled. I propose a repertory-general definition of musical meter, based on modern research, that avoids all of the identified problems, but requires some minor terminological retooling.

On Metrical Structure and Cueing Systems in Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues"
Bill Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues" is a signature item in the bluegrass canon. Indeed, Monroe himself claims to have discovered the essence of bluegrass rhythm in this old Jimmie Rodgers tune. And yet, the song stands in sharp contrast to the metrical and hypermetrical norms that shaped bluegrass music as it developed in the 1950s and ’60s, eschewing regular four-bar hypermeter in favor of a highly irregular phrase structure with seemingly indeterminate downbeats. This paper offers an analysis of Monroe’s “Muleskinner Blues” conducted with an eye toward its fluid approach to meter. I show how the song’s metrical structure, embodied in the group actions of the Blue Grass Boys, responds flexibly to Bill Monroe’s extended vocal expressions. In so doing, my analysis highlights the musical events that forecast impending harmonic changes, providing key insight into the “cueing systems” (Gupta 2017) that hold together such improvisatory musical spaces. The paper thus supplements existing studies on style-wide systems of licks and progression schemes (Adler 1974; Stoia 2013) required for successful bluegrass picking, arguing that a Blue Grass Boy would additionally require song-specific schemas to facilitate quick musical responses in a constrained yet flexible musical environment.

Many Malinke Meters: Analytical Applications of Meter
Theory to Dance Drumming of Guinea
According to Justin London’s <i>many meters hypothesis</i>, meters are “highly context-specific patterns of temporal expectation that govern our attention to, as well as performance of, rhythmic sequences” (London 2012, 8), where each meter is “a coordinated set of periodic temporal cycles of sensorimotor attention” (91). By aligning London’s concept of temporal cycles with Gerhard Kubik’s four African “basic, cross-culturally valid reference levels with regard to timing: … elementary pulsation[s], … reference beat[s], … cycle[s]” (Kubik 2010, 31), and “time-line patterns” (57), this paper seeks to establish an analytical procedure to quantify the many meters used in Guinean Malinke dance drumming.
Guinean Malinke dance drumming is performed by an eight-to-ten-part polyrhythmic percussion ensemble. The music is constructed of cycles of multiple repeating patterns of varying lengths. While many accompaniments are multi-use, each piece utilizes an identity pattern in the form of an eight- to sixteen-beat melo-rhythmic conversation between two of the drums. This paper analyzes a corpus of 76 pieces as taught and published by former national ballet drummers to establish the many meters at work in Malinke dance drumming. I then demonstrate the ways in which the identity pattern and accompaniments of each piece may be expressed as contours of varying strength and weakness relative to its multiple specific, both isochronous and non-isochronous (timeline), metric layers. A quantification of these overlapping shapes allows a view of the depth and complexity of this music.

An Investigation of Metrical Dissonance in Tap Dance Improvisation
A “cutting contest” is a public challenge between two skilled tap dancers, who alternate increasingly elaborate rhythmic sequences, beginning with eight bars per sequence, ultimately reducing to a single bar. Dancers must enter on time (pick-ups and syncopated entrances are permitted), lest they forfeit the contest. At the start of the contest, the tap dancers and judges negotiate the meter and tempo of the contest. The judge gives a count-off bar and the first dancer begins as the only “musical source.” The original meter is maintained by the judge through the tapping of his/her feet, although rendered inaudible by the audience’s verbal reactions to the dancer’s steps. The opponent keeps his eyes locked on the soloist as he silently counts. Since tap dancers create the audible rhythmic patterns, while the meter is “unheard,” dancers use metric dissonance (Krebs 1999; Love 2013) in hopes of metrically misleading one’s opponent.
In this paper, I aim to demonstrate that tap dancers use metrical dissonance as means of confusing their opponents. I will examine solos by Joshua Johnson, Jumaane Taylor, and Sarah Reich. Since the primary goal of the opponent is to be able to identify the meter at all times, tap soloists strategize their own unpitched tap shoes to accent metrical dissonances that cloud the original meter.

Middleground Prototypes for Mozart's
First-Movement Concerto Forms
Tonal theorists have neglected the concerto compared to most other formal genres. In this paper, I present exposition prototypes for Mozart’s major-mode concerto forms, analyzing the opening movements of K. 488 and K. 447 as examples. In doing so, I also suggest a solution to potential Kopfton contradictions arising from the “double-expositional” structure typical of concerto first movements.
I propose a set of eight middleground exposition prototypes for Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) Type 5 sonata. These prototypes account for each combination of third- and fifth-progressions for P and one or two S themes. Since the opening ritornello (doubling as a first “exposition”) typically does not modulate, and since the recapitulation synthesizes material in the two expositions, Type 5 sonatas are replete with sites of potential conflict between third- and fifth-progressions. Some permutations do not cause any inherent problems, as demonstrated in an analysis of K. 488.
However, the challenge of Kopfton contradiction arises in the combination of descending from 3^   in P and from 5^   in S. Rather than dismissing this possibility, I suggest a middleground “hybrid descent” (5 ^  –4    ^  –3^  —3^  –2^  –1^  ) that can be interpreted from either Kopfton according to context, using K. 447 as an example. The hybrid allows for a nuanced interpretation of concerto movements with dialogue between  3^   and 5^  , providing a solution to one of many analytical challenges posed by the classical concerto and spearheading a new branch of scholarship on tonal analysis of concerto forms.

The Hymn as a Musical Topic in Haydn's Symphonies:
Stylistic Sources and Expressive Trajectories
Scholars regularly describe the opening themes from the slow movements of Haydn’s Symphonies Nos. 75, 87, 88, and 98 as “hymn-like,” even crediting Haydn as the creator of this theme-type (Rosen 1971). Despite frequent observations on the similarities between themes, little attention has been paid to the comparative study of these entire movements. This paper focuses on this set of symphonic hymns as a case study to address two issues central to the theory of musical topics: first, the necessity (and difficulty) of properly grounding topics in the musical landscape of their time, and second, how the interaction of topics with one another and with other elements of musical structure can generate diverse expressive trajectories.
I demonstrate that these themes resemble, rather than church music, the musical style of opera scenes depicting ritual actions performed by female or supernatural cohorts. More precisely, the Largo from Symphony No. 88 features remarkable similarities with Gluck’s <i>Orphée et Eurydice</i> and the Adagio of Symphony No. 98 presents close parallelisms with Haydn’s own rendition of the Orphic myth. In each of the symphonies mentioned above, Haydn revisits the same theme-type but adapts it every time to an entirely different formal design (theme and variations, monothematic and bi-thematic sonata form, and sonata-rondo), highlighting diverse meanings generated by the hymn topic through expressive oppositions. Because these movements feature remarkably similar themes but maximally divergent formal layouts, analyzing them as a group illustrates Haydn’s oft-invoked authorial voice and the productive interplay between topics and compositional strategies.




CORRALLING THE CHORALE: MOVING AWAY FROM SATB WRITING IN THE UNDERGRADUATE MUSIC THEORY
CURRICULUM (TAFT C)
<i>Presentations, Lightning Talks, and Panel Discussion
</i>William van Geest (University of Michigan), Chair
Jennifer Snodgrass (Appalachian State University), Respondent
Four-part chorale-style writing is so central to music theory pedagogy that it is difficult to imagine a curriculum without it. Yet, as much as we rely on chorales to teach general principles of music, they are specific in structure and their origins lie in a specifically German theological tradition. This raises a number of questions: are chorales effective for the purposes to which we put them? What pedagogical possibilities do they obscure? What can our reliance on this genre tell us about North American music theory and the commitments or anxieties it carries? Overall: are we right to depend on SATB writing as we do? In this panel, we seek to engage with these questions by examining the role of the chorale in the undergraduate theory curriculum and proposing pedagogical approaches that delay, reconfigure, or replace it.
This panel consists of six papers. The first, a 20-minute paper, will examine the chorale in contemporary music theory textbooks as a means of establishing a baseline for current pedagogical practices. Following this paper, five lightning talks will address curricular implications and pressures as well as proposals to shift the chorale’s traditional applications. Panelists draw largely on first-hand experience from various institutional settings, including a liberal-arts college, a state school, a research university, a conservatory, and a school of music. Finally, Professor Jennifer Snodgrass will offer a response, after which those in attendance are invited to contribute to the discussion.

The Chorale in American Music Theory:
A Corpus Study of Leading Textbooks
While music theorists widely acknowledge the chorale’s privileged position in American music theory, very little scholarship critically examines this position. In this paper, I address this omission by presenting a corpus study of leading undergraduate textbooks. I aim through this study not only to establish the prevalence of chorales in undergraduate music theory instruction, but, more importantly, to reveal some particularities of their usage and the commitments this usage encodes.
I begin by investigating chorales’ prevalence. I examine their incidence among musical examples, authors’ purposes in using them, and their distribution relative to particular topics. I also explore authors’ handling of chorales. I demonstrate their preference for four-part, vocal, homophonic chorale-harmonizations by J. S. Bach; but I also discuss their presentation, both visually and aurally, as a texture rather than as a genre, and one abstracted from cultural context and instrumentation. Through an examination of authors’ explicit definitions of the terms “chorale” and “chorale style,” I show the chorale’s close connection to a widely held model of musical structure. Indeed, to all appearances, the chorale in American music theorists’ preferred form is virtually indistinguishable from this model of musical structure. Finally, I discuss authors’ justifications for employing chorales and “chorale style”: their various appeals—to biology, musical norms, and musical ontologies, among others—and attempts to normativize chorale-related practices.
Through this corpus study, I then show that the chorale lies deeply entrenched in American music theory and is closely connected to the field’s basic practices and theoretical commitments.

Resolving Chords to Resolve Anxieties:
Pressures around Teaching the Chorale
Theory curricula are shaped not only by the perceived needs of our students, but also by pressures—both real and imagined—to produce students that exhibit competency in the rules of voice-leading, phrase structure, and other concepts that are traditionally taught in conservatories and schools of music. Central to these competencies is the mastery of chorale-style writing and its attendant voice-leading rules. In this brief talk, I address the pressures, labor costs, and anxieties that constrain attempts to decentralize chorale-style writing in the undergraduate curriculum.
Internally, one must fit within a cohesive departmental curriculum. More broadly, textbook norms and common curricular practices across schools provide self-reinforcing standards for what music is and how musicians should understand it—a lingua franca of musicianship, one which currently includes skills in SATB part-writing. Moreover, any curricular changes de-emphasizing SATB materials also impose hidden labor costs on instructors. To move away from textbook norms, faculty must construct new materials and reconfigure existing ones, a significant task that reduces time for other activities that are necessary to one’s job. Such changes also compel theory instructors to reconsider their skills as pedagogues: a shift away from chorales likely involves moving away from their own undergraduate training, and thus acquiring new skills.
As we consider decentralizing SATB activities, we must take into account that instructors deploying changes bear costs and face anxieties and pressures from ourselves, our departments, and our peer institutions.

Administering Pedagogy: Navigating the Institutional Impacts of a Changing Theory Curriculum
Implementing a new music theory curriculum involves more than the details of course design. Curricular changes may impact multiple faculty members and areas of study across a department, conservatory, or school of music, whether the program is highly integrated or isolated. Proposing such changes must involve careful consideration of both the process and impact beyond the theory classroom. In this paper, I draw on my experience as a music theory instructor, course coordinator, and theory area administrator to highlight common challenges of implementing a new theory curriculum. Specifically, I use the decentralization of chorale-style components in a music theory curriculum as a case-study.
Drawing on interviews and surveys of administrators, students, and music theory instructors across multiple institutions, I employ two primary perspectives throughout the paper. The first is as a music theory instructor addressing administrators and colleagues regarding potential impacts on courses both inside and outside the theory curriculum, while the second is as an administrator addressing potential impacts on the department or institution. Each perspective offers positive or negative valences on specific aspects and dimensions of the curriculum change. Throughout the paper I examine intersections of both perspectives as measured valuations on five aspects of a chorale-deemphasized curricular change: (1) textbook and course materials; (2) impacts on non-music-theory colleagues and their courses; (3) student reactions; (4) strategies for dealing with resistance to changes; and (5) outlooks on institutional recruitment, retention, and future placement of students.

Repurposing the Chorale in the Theory Classroom
Theorists often endeavor to show the chorale’s relevance to Western classical music, but typically stop short of demonstrating how four-part writing applies to students’ other musical activities. Given the substantial costs associated with four-part writing, it can be a risky investment. Failure to connect the topic with non-classroom-based musical practice jeopardizes losing the return, leaving students disenchanted and discouraged. In this paper, I show how chorale-style writing and analysis can be reimagined in a liberal arts program in order to relate to a wider array of musical interests. My aim here is not to minimize or abandon the utility of the chorale, but rather to repurpose four-part writing for application in non-classical styles.
Through early exploration of rules and departures, I lay groundwork for the flexibility that may be asked of students in other theory classrooms, performing ensembles, composition, and other creative practice. By the time I introduce four-part writing, we have already seen that some of the most compelling parts of music come when rules are eschewed or worked around, which is particularly relevant to Bach chorales. We discuss how different rules apply in different contexts—for students looking to improve their performance in an ensemble, arranging for an a capella group, or music-directing a staged show, I find conversations such as these help them direct their theory work into musical practice. My experience has shown that chorale-later architectures invite students from diverse backgrounds to engage analytically without being hindered by the steep learning curve of chorale-based practices.

Teaching Undergraduate Voice-Leading with
Neo-Riemannian Techniques
While the term "voice-leading" in undergraduate music theory courses often refers to chorale harmonization or species counterpoint, Neo-Riemannian theory offers another way of engaging deeply with the succession of harmonies and the movement of individual voices. This paper advocates for including Neo-Riemannian theory in core undergraduate theory courses, and outlines a modular sample curriculum. A unit on Neo-Riemannian theory can be invigorating for students, as it offers them new ways of thinking about chromatic music, and of re-interpreting other frequently taught topics such as modal mixture. And as a capstone to the "tonal" portion of the undergraduate curriculum, Neo-Riemannian theory can serve as a gentle introduction to many of the concepts introduced in the "20th-century” course that often ends the sequence. Simple and direct examples serve as a jumping-off point: students can sing or notate straightforward transformations. Later in the unit, consideration of the many geometric models of tonal space prepares students to deal with the abstractions and operations of pitch-class set theory, or to navigate the difficulties of dealing in abstractions away from the musical surface. Such examples also lend themselves to compelling visual analyses, which students can use as they listen to music, and which they often enjoy producing themselves. Finally, Neo-Riemannian theory offers the opportunity to incorporate new repertoires into the undergraduate core curriculum: not only the highly chromatic 19th-century music originally addressed by the theory, but also popular music, film music, jazz, and other styles.

Marcelle Pierson (University of Pittsburgh)
Building an Undergraduate Curriculum without SATB Writing
This paper presents possibilities for those who wish to decentralize chorale writing in particular, and perhaps classical music in general, in their own curricula. I report from my own experiences of constructing and directing a four-semester curriculum that gives only glancing attention to chorale writing and its voice leading rules. Decentralizing chorales in the theory classroom is not without its challenges; these include a dearth of pedagogical support from textbooks and lack of a unified pedagogical framework. I show how I am able to respond to these challenges by developing an eclectic, modular curriculum that seeks to be responsive to the interests and needs of my students.
In my curriculum, Theory I acts as a gateway course while the other three courses may be taken in any order and rotated out of the sequence according to instructor and student interest (the other three classes are currently rhythm, counterpoint, and contemporary styles). Rotating out classes allows the instructor to respond to the always-changing musical lives of students at a given institution and impart skills applicable across a wide variety of musical activities, from church arrangements to beat-making, popular songwriting, and/or classical music performance and composition. I argue that a non-sequential and eclectic approach can constitute a first step toward deconstructing the problematic yet pervasive teleology of style that informs mainstream music theory pedagogy at present. It is one way to keep apace of our rapidly shifting world, and to stay relevant to our students’ increasingly diverse musical experiences.
