Anti-Telos Choruses in Recent Pop
Reports of the chorus’s death have been increasing in pop-critical circles. Indeed, after decades of “don’t bore us, get to the chorus,” many recent pop songs place their focus away from their choruses, subverting normative formal models and opening up space for teleological climax to occur elsewhere. One particular subversive technique pervades post-2010 pop music: after a textural buildup in a verse and prechorus, the chorus begins with a sudden and extreme drop in energy, negating any release of tension and making the chorus the song’s point of lowest energy. In this paper, I investigate the hermeneutics of these "anti-telos choruses," drawing analytical examples from Top-40 hits of the current decade.
Anti-telos choruses in general serve two expressive purposes. First, they engender a sense of intimacy between song persona and listener. Drawing on Allan Moore’s concept of proxemics (2012) and Asaf Peres’s "sonic functions" (2016), I demonstrate that anti-telos choruses employ sonic techniques associated with closeness, such as removing reverb from the vocal line, omitting any accompaniment in the voice’s pitch range, and using a soft and quiet singing style. Second, anti-telos choruses open up space for other sections to act as a song’s energetic peak, thus threatening the chorus’s status as a climactic focal point. My discussion ultimately demonstrates how form is not just a basic template for song design but an inherently expressive feature of pop songs.

"...a jolly good time": Understanding Groove in Progressive Rock
Progressive rock is characterized by scholars and music critics as a genre that emphasizes the mind over the body, such that it is “not about music for dancing” (Macan 1997), but rather designed for careful listening. When groove-based sections do occur, they often feature complex rhythms or meters that “[lessen] the music’s bodily appeal, calling for thought about rhythm rather than immediate participation in it” (Stone 2016). Other scholars, however, have argued that prog fans do engage with this music bodily, suggesting that the phenomenon of groove in prog deserves further exploration.
While previous scholarship on metrically complex grooves has discussed their structural features or their signification of artistic seriousness, I focus on how musical elements model the process by which listeners might learn how to entrain to these grooves. Prog songs frequently feature teleological processes in which “difficult” grooves are repeated until they become contextually stable in a sequence that may span multiple formal units. Similarly, textural modifications likewise counterbalance rhythmic and metric complexity, creating a narrative arc that rewards the learning of complex temporal patterns. Through several analytical vignettes, I demonstrate how the “groove-learning process” enacted in these songs interacts with text and formal structure. Thus, these grooves provide insight into how “music for listening” may be rendered danceable.

Extended Final Phrases in Popular Songs
As analysts and listeners, we place special importance on closure at the ends of tonal works. There are many theoretical and analytical considerations of this issue in art music, but few in popular music, and most of those focus on harmonic structures. The roles of phrase rhythm and hypermeter in creating closure in popular songs has been little explored. This paper examines a closing technique discussed by Kirnberger and other 18th-century theorists that persists in 20th-century popular songs, whereby the last statement of a regular four-bar phrase is extended by one or more bars. In modern terms, this extension often shifts the final bar of the phrase from a hypermetrically weak position to a strong one, increasing the sense of closure. This technique helps to differentiate the final section (which is often a chorus) from its earlier iterations, and resembles the end-accented “closing-theme schema” discussed by Temperley and Ng. Final phrases can be extended and end-weighted through three basic techniques, which may be used alone or in combination: composed-out decelerations, extensions of the cadential progression, and internal repetitions. The high degree of repetition, short length of repeated units, and prevalence of open-ended formal sections in popular songs render the issue of closure more problematic than in art music. This paper demonstrates that 20th-century popular songwriters sometimes adopted a much older strategy for achieving conclusive endings, and suggests that phrase structure and hypermeter in popular songs are less regular than has been generally assumed.

Damaged Cargo: Concerning the Unfortunate Voyage of Classical Poetic Theory to the Land of the Modern Music-Theory Textbook
Music theory textbooks share a consensus definition of meter, which is directly appropriated from the late 18th century. I identify several problems with the definition, from the standpoint of modern metric research. I propose that the problems result from a three-stage process of transmission, whose origin is the ancient Greek theory of poetic verse feet, and whose intermediate stages are 18th-century theory of poetic prosody, and 18th-century theory of (mostly) vocal music. At each stage, the source has considerable prestige within the culture of the target domain. This encourages an uncritical adoption ("shoehorning") of features that fit poorly with the repertories being modelled. I propose a repertory-general definition of musical meter, based on modern research, that avoids all of the identified problems, but requires some minor terminological retooling.

On Metrical Structure and Cueing Systems in Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues"
Bill Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues" is a signature item in the bluegrass canon. Indeed, Monroe himself claims to have discovered the essence of bluegrass rhythm in this old Jimmie Rodgers tune. And yet, the song stands in sharp contrast to the metrical and hypermetrical norms that shaped bluegrass music as it developed in the 1950s and ’60s, eschewing regular four-bar hypermeter in favor of a highly irregular phrase structure with seemingly indeterminate downbeats. This paper offers an analysis of Monroe’s “Muleskinner Blues” conducted with an eye toward its fluid approach to meter. I show how the song’s metrical structure, embodied in the group actions of the Blue Grass Boys, responds flexibly to Bill Monroe’s extended vocal expressions. In so doing, my analysis highlights the musical events that forecast impending harmonic changes, providing key insight into the “cueing systems” (Gupta 2017) that hold together such improvisatory musical spaces. The paper thus supplements existing studies on style-wide systems of licks and progression schemes (Adler 1974; Stoia 2013) required for successful bluegrass picking, arguing that a Blue Grass Boy would additionally require song-specific schemas to facilitate quick musical responses in a constrained yet flexible musical environment.

Many Malinke Meters: Analytical Applications of Meter
Theory to Dance Drumming of Guinea
According to Justin London’s <i>many meters hypothesis</i>, meters are “highly context-specific patterns of temporal expectation that govern our attention to, as well as performance of, rhythmic sequences” (London 2012, 8), where each meter is “a coordinated set of periodic temporal cycles of sensorimotor attention” (91). By aligning London’s concept of temporal cycles with Gerhard Kubik’s four African “basic, cross-culturally valid reference levels with regard to timing: … elementary pulsation[s], … reference beat[s], … cycle[s]” (Kubik 2010, 31), and “time-line patterns” (57), this paper seeks to establish an analytical procedure to quantify the many meters used in Guinean Malinke dance drumming.
Guinean Malinke dance drumming is performed by an eight-to-ten-part polyrhythmic percussion ensemble. The music is constructed of cycles of multiple repeating patterns of varying lengths. While many accompaniments are multi-use, each piece utilizes an identity pattern in the form of an eight- to sixteen-beat melo-rhythmic conversation between two of the drums. This paper analyzes a corpus of 76 pieces as taught and published by former national ballet drummers to establish the many meters at work in Malinke dance drumming. I then demonstrate the ways in which the identity pattern and accompaniments of each piece may be expressed as contours of varying strength and weakness relative to its multiple specific, both isochronous and non-isochronous (timeline), metric layers. A quantification of these overlapping shapes allows a view of the depth and complexity of this music.

An Investigation of Metrical Dissonance in Tap Dance Improvisation
A “cutting contest” is a public challenge between two skilled tap dancers, who alternate increasingly elaborate rhythmic sequences, beginning with eight bars per sequence, ultimately reducing to a single bar. Dancers must enter on time (pick-ups and syncopated entrances are permitted), lest they forfeit the contest. At the start of the contest, the tap dancers and judges negotiate the meter and tempo of the contest. The judge gives a count-off bar and the first dancer begins as the only “musical source.” The original meter is maintained by the judge through the tapping of his/her feet, although rendered inaudible by the audience’s verbal reactions to the dancer’s steps. The opponent keeps his eyes locked on the soloist as he silently counts. Since tap dancers create the audible rhythmic patterns, while the meter is “unheard,” dancers use metric dissonance (Krebs 1999; Love 2013) in hopes of metrically misleading one’s opponent.
In this paper, I aim to demonstrate that tap dancers use metrical dissonance as means of confusing their opponents. I will examine solos by Joshua Johnson, Jumaane Taylor, and Sarah Reich. Since the primary goal of the opponent is to be able to identify the meter at all times, tap soloists strategize their own unpitched tap shoes to accent metrical dissonances that cloud the original meter.

Middleground Prototypes for Mozart's
First-Movement Concerto Forms
Tonal theorists have neglected the concerto compared to most other formal genres. In this paper, I present exposition prototypes for Mozart’s major-mode concerto forms, analyzing the opening movements of K. 488 and K. 447 as examples. In doing so, I also suggest a solution to potential Kopfton contradictions arising from the “double-expositional” structure typical of concerto first movements.
I propose a set of eight middleground exposition prototypes for Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) Type 5 sonata. These prototypes account for each combination of third- and fifth-progressions for P and one or two S themes. Since the opening ritornello (doubling as a first “exposition”) typically does not modulate, and since the recapitulation synthesizes material in the two expositions, Type 5 sonatas are replete with sites of potential conflict between third- and fifth-progressions. Some permutations do not cause any inherent problems, as demonstrated in an analysis of K. 488.
However, the challenge of Kopfton contradiction arises in the combination of descending from 3^   in P and from 5^   in S. Rather than dismissing this possibility, I suggest a middleground “hybrid descent” (5 ^  –4    ^  –3^  —3^  –2^  –1^  ) that can be interpreted from either Kopfton according to context, using K. 447 as an example. The hybrid allows for a nuanced interpretation of concerto movements with dialogue between  3^   and 5^  , providing a solution to one of many analytical challenges posed by the classical concerto and spearheading a new branch of scholarship on tonal analysis of concerto forms.

The Hymn as a Musical Topic in Haydn's Symphonies:
Stylistic Sources and Expressive Trajectories
Scholars regularly describe the opening themes from the slow movements of Haydn’s Symphonies Nos. 75, 87, 88, and 98 as “hymn-like,” even crediting Haydn as the creator of this theme-type (Rosen 1971). Despite frequent observations on the similarities between themes, little attention has been paid to the comparative study of these entire movements. This paper focuses on this set of symphonic hymns as a case study to address two issues central to the theory of musical topics: first, the necessity (and difficulty) of properly grounding topics in the musical landscape of their time, and second, how the interaction of topics with one another and with other elements of musical structure can generate diverse expressive trajectories.
I demonstrate that these themes resemble, rather than church music, the musical style of opera scenes depicting ritual actions performed by female or supernatural cohorts. More precisely, the Largo from Symphony No. 88 features remarkable similarities with Gluck’s <i>Orphée et Eurydice</i> and the Adagio of Symphony No. 98 presents close parallelisms with Haydn’s own rendition of the Orphic myth. In each of the symphonies mentioned above, Haydn revisits the same theme-type but adapts it every time to an entirely different formal design (theme and variations, monothematic and bi-thematic sonata form, and sonata-rondo), highlighting diverse meanings generated by the hymn topic through expressive oppositions. Because these movements feature remarkably similar themes but maximally divergent formal layouts, analyzing them as a group illustrates Haydn’s oft-invoked authorial voice and the productive interplay between topics and compositional strategies.




CORRALLING THE CHORALE: MOVING AWAY FROM SATB WRITING IN THE UNDERGRADUATE MUSIC THEORY
CURRICULUM (TAFT C)
<i>Presentations, Lightning Talks, and Panel Discussion

Jennifer Snodgrass (Appalachian State University), Respondent
Four-part chorale-style writing is so central to music theory pedagogy that it is difficult to imagine a curriculum without it. Yet, as much as we rely on chorales to teach general principles of music, they are specific in structure and their origins lie in a specifically German theological tradition. This raises a number of questions: are chorales effective for the purposes to which we put them? What pedagogical possibilities do they obscure? What can our reliance on this genre tell us about North American music theory and the commitments or anxieties it carries? Overall: are we right to depend on SATB writing as we do? In this panel, we seek to engage with these questions by examining the role of the chorale in the undergraduate theory curriculum and proposing pedagogical approaches that delay, reconfigure, or replace it.
This panel consists of six papers. The first, a 20-minute paper, will examine the chorale in contemporary music theory textbooks as a means of establishing a baseline for current pedagogical practices. Following this paper, five lightning talks will address curricular implications and pressures as well as proposals to shift the chorale’s traditional applications. Panelists draw largely on first-hand experience from various institutional settings, including a liberal-arts college, a state school, a research university, a conservatory, and a school of music. Finally, Professor Jennifer Snodgrass will offer a response, after which those in attendance are invited to contribute to the discussion.

The Chorale in American Music Theory:
A Corpus Study of Leading Textbooks
While music theorists widely acknowledge the chorale’s privileged position in American music theory, very little scholarship critically examines this position. In this paper, I address this omission by presenting a corpus study of leading undergraduate textbooks. I aim through this study not only to establish the prevalence of chorales in undergraduate music theory instruction, but, more importantly, to reveal some particularities of their usage and the commitments this usage encodes.
I begin by investigating chorales’ prevalence. I examine their incidence among musical examples, authors’ purposes in using them, and their distribution relative to particular topics. I also explore authors’ handling of chorales. I demonstrate their preference for four-part, vocal, homophonic chorale-harmonizations by J. S. Bach; but I also discuss their presentation, both visually and aurally, as a texture rather than as a genre, and one abstracted from cultural context and instrumentation. Through an examination of authors’ explicit definitions of the terms “chorale” and “chorale style,” I show the chorale’s close connection to a widely held model of musical structure. Indeed, to all appearances, the chorale in American music theorists’ preferred form is virtually indistinguishable from this model of musical structure. Finally, I discuss authors’ justifications for employing chorales and “chorale style”: their various appeals—to biology, musical norms, and musical ontologies, among others—and attempts to normativize chorale-related practices.
Through this corpus study, I then show that the chorale lies deeply entrenched in American music theory and is closely connected to the field’s basic practices and theoretical commitments.

Resolving Chords to Resolve Anxieties:
Pressures around Teaching the Chorale
Theory curricula are shaped not only by the perceived needs of our students, but also by pressures—both real and imagined—to produce students that exhibit competency in the rules of voice-leading, phrase structure, and other concepts that are traditionally taught in conservatories and schools of music. Central to these competencies is the mastery of chorale-style writing and its attendant voice-leading rules. In this brief talk, I address the pressures, labor costs, and anxieties that constrain attempts to decentralize chorale-style writing in the undergraduate curriculum.
Internally, one must fit within a cohesive departmental curriculum. More broadly, textbook norms and common curricular practices across schools provide self-reinforcing standards for what music is and how musicians should understand it—a lingua franca of musicianship, one which currently includes skills in SATB part-writing. Moreover, any curricular changes de-emphasizing SATB materials also impose hidden labor costs on instructors. To move away from textbook norms, faculty must construct new materials and reconfigure existing ones, a significant task that reduces time for other activities that are necessary to one’s job. Such changes also compel theory instructors to reconsider their skills as pedagogues: a shift away from chorales likely involves moving away from their own undergraduate training, and thus acquiring new skills.
As we consider decentralizing SATB activities, we must take into account that instructors deploying changes bear costs and face anxieties and pressures from ourselves, our departments, and our peer institutions.

Administering Pedagogy: Navigating the Institutional Impacts of a Changing Theory Curriculum
Implementing a new music theory curriculum involves more than the details of course design. Curricular changes may impact multiple faculty members and areas of study across a department, conservatory, or school of music, whether the program is highly integrated or isolated. Proposing such changes must involve careful consideration of both the process and impact beyond the theory classroom. In this paper, I draw on my experience as a music theory instructor, course coordinator, and theory area administrator to highlight common challenges of implementing a new theory curriculum. Specifically, I use the decentralization of chorale-style components in a music theory curriculum as a case-study.
Drawing on interviews and surveys of administrators, students, and music theory instructors across multiple institutions, I employ two primary perspectives throughout the paper. The first is as a music theory instructor addressing administrators and colleagues regarding potential impacts on courses both inside and outside the theory curriculum, while the second is as an administrator addressing potential impacts on the department or institution. Each perspective offers positive or negative valences on specific aspects and dimensions of the curriculum change. Throughout the paper I examine intersections of both perspectives as measured valuations on five aspects of a chorale-deemphasized curricular change: (1) textbook and course materials; (2) impacts on non-music-theory colleagues and their courses; (3) student reactions; (4) strategies for dealing with resistance to changes; and (5) outlooks on institutional recruitment, retention, and future placement of students.

Repurposing the Chorale in the Theory Classroom
Theorists often endeavor to show the chorale’s relevance to Western classical music, but typically stop short of demonstrating how four-part writing applies to students’ other musical activities. Given the substantial costs associated with four-part writing, it can be a risky investment. Failure to connect the topic with non-classroom-based musical practice jeopardizes losing the return, leaving students disenchanted and discouraged. In this paper, I show how chorale-style writing and analysis can be reimagined in a liberal arts program in order to relate to a wider array of musical interests. My aim here is not to minimize or abandon the utility of the chorale, but rather to repurpose four-part writing for application in non-classical styles.
Through early exploration of rules and departures, I lay groundwork for the flexibility that may be asked of students in other theory classrooms, performing ensembles, composition, and other creative practice. By the time I introduce four-part writing, we have already seen that some of the most compelling parts of music come when rules are eschewed or worked around, which is particularly relevant to Bach chorales. We discuss how different rules apply in different contexts—for students looking to improve their performance in an ensemble, arranging for an a capella group, or music-directing a staged show, I find conversations such as these help them direct their theory work into musical practice. My experience has shown that chorale-later architectures invite students from diverse backgrounds to engage analytically without being hindered by the steep learning curve of chorale-based practices.

Teaching Undergraduate Voice-Leading with
Neo-Riemannian Techniques
While the term "voice-leading" in undergraduate music theory courses often refers to chorale harmonization or species counterpoint, Neo-Riemannian theory offers another way of engaging deeply with the succession of harmonies and the movement of individual voices. This paper advocates for including Neo-Riemannian theory in core undergraduate theory courses, and outlines a modular sample curriculum. A unit on Neo-Riemannian theory can be invigorating for students, as it offers them new ways of thinking about chromatic music, and of re-interpreting other frequently taught topics such as modal mixture. And as a capstone to the "tonal" portion of the undergraduate curriculum, Neo-Riemannian theory can serve as a gentle introduction to many of the concepts introduced in the "20th-century” course that often ends the sequence. Simple and direct examples serve as a jumping-off point: students can sing or notate straightforward transformations. Later in the unit, consideration of the many geometric models of tonal space prepares students to deal with the abstractions and operations of pitch-class set theory, or to navigate the difficulties of dealing in abstractions away from the musical surface. Such examples also lend themselves to compelling visual analyses, which students can use as they listen to music, and which they often enjoy producing themselves. Finally, Neo-Riemannian theory offers the opportunity to incorporate new repertoires into the undergraduate core curriculum: not only the highly chromatic 19th-century music originally addressed by the theory, but also popular music, film music, jazz, and other styles.

Marcelle Pierson (University of Pittsburgh)
Building an Undergraduate Curriculum without SATB Writing
This paper presents possibilities for those who wish to decentralize chorale writing in particular, and perhaps classical music in general, in their own curricula. I report from my own experiences of constructing and directing a four-semester curriculum that gives only glancing attention to chorale writing and its voice leading rules. Decentralizing chorales in the theory classroom is not without its challenges; these include a dearth of pedagogical support from textbooks and lack of a unified pedagogical framework. I show how I am able to respond to these challenges by developing an eclectic, modular curriculum that seeks to be responsive to the interests and needs of my students.
In my curriculum, Theory I acts as a gateway course while the other three courses may be taken in any order and rotated out of the sequence according to instructor and student interest (the other three classes are currently rhythm, counterpoint, and contemporary styles). Rotating out classes allows the instructor to respond to the always-changing musical lives of students at a given institution and impart skills applicable across a wide variety of musical activities, from church arrangements to beat-making, popular songwriting, and/or classical music performance and composition. I argue that a non-sequential and eclectic approach can constitute a first step toward deconstructing the problematic yet pervasive teleology of style that informs mainstream music theory pedagogy at present. It is one way to keep apace of our rapidly shifting world, and to stay relevant to our students’ increasingly diverse musical experiences.
