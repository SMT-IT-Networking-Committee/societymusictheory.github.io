Harmony, Timbre, and Form

Harmonic Syntax in the Canzonas of Frescobaldi
Frescobaldi’s canzonas reflect the rapidly evolving harmonic language of the early 17th century and prefigure the formal and textural characteristics of the mid 17th-century instrumental sonata. My paper explores Frescobaldi’s harmonic style in 44 three- and four-part canzonas, all published
during the composer’s lifetime (<i>Canzoni</i> (1608), <i>Il primo libro delle canzoni</i> (1628–35), <i>Canzoni da sonare</i> (1634), <i>Fiori musicali</i> (1635), <i>Canzoni franzese</i> (1642)).
Harmonic syntax is important in defining musical style, but it is poorly understood in 17th-century music. Previous studies of tonality at the beginning (Powers 1981, 1992, 1998) and end (Barnett 1998, 2002, 2008, 2010) of the 17th century do not address harmonic syntax. I argue that Frescobaldi’s canzonas are an important link between the Renaissance and the Baroque, laying the groundwork for common-practice harmony and helping to establish tonalities that appear in the works of later 17th-century composers. I demonstrate that while some of Frescobaldi’s tonalities have a sound of their own, others are highly similar, both in terms of chord histograms (tallies of occurrence) and chord progressions (modeled as Markov chains), forecasting the transpositional relationship between 18th-century keys.

Another Geometry of Music: Harmony and Counterpoint in Some Unextended Common Practices
The subtitular “extension” of Dmitri Tymoczko’s (2011) <i>A Geometry of Music</i> is nominally of—but ultimately away from—some common tonal practices of the 18th and 19th centuries (hereafter, CPs). Endeavors to recuperate the book’s first of “four basic claims,” which is that “harmony and counterpoint constrain one another” (Claim One), demonstrate this divergence. Claim One supposes a polyphonic passage whose lines exhibit “conjunct melodic motion” and whose chords exhibit “harmonic consistency.” For Tymoczko, pc transpositional or inversional equivalence defines this consistency. Claim One purports that these two features require that the chords be either nearly even and thus relatively consonant, or clusters. However, using parallel motion, any chord can voice-lead with conjunct melodic motion to another equivalent chord, which Tymoczko acknowledges later in the book.
One could recuperate Claim One by replacing conjunct melodic motion with minimal idealized total voice-leading work, reverting to Richard Cohn’s “overdetermination.” However, the pitch-class equivalency that this recuperation necessitates also disowns aspects of CPs essential to any grammar-like theory for them: top line, bass line, and bass-defined harmonic consonance. Or one could recuperate Claim One by recognizing that conjunct melodic motion, avoidance of parallel motion, and preferred harmony constrain one another because any two of these disallow the third. Calling this “underdetermination,” I have recognized this constraint in two-voice scenarios favoring imperfect harmony. Generalizing this two-voice model, I have fashioned a bounded geometry that can depict passages in any number of voices, whereby proximity to the boundary represents CP-typicality.

Shades of Sound, Subtle and Sublime—Theoretical
Implications of the Color/Tone Color Metaphor
The metaphorical relationship between sound and color has a rich and fascinating history within Western musical thought. In this paper, I address music theoretical and occult versions of the timbre-color metaphor and apply these considerations to Schoenberg’s <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>, providing new support for Cramer’s (2000) reevaluation of this concept through examination of Schoenberg’s links with the color/tone color metaphor in contemporary occult culture.
I argue that critical subtleties of the color/tone color metaphor became masked by the way that early music science defined timbre as one of three separable dimensions of a tone, alongside pitch and loudness. I identify a more complex perspective on tone color from the 19th century and earlier, where timbral changes are considered as covarying with register, and call on the language of color, imposing visual properties on the realm of sound.
The second half of this paper examines how the history of the color/tone color metaphor relates to <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>, building on Cramer’s (2002) contention that <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> was originally conceived to involve the perception of the timbral colorings of frequencies. I explore how the history of the color/tone color metaphor relates to Schoenberg’s definition of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> and lends new support to Cramer’s reading.
Finally, I propose another layer of historical and cultural context that enriches our understanding of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i>: Schoenberg’s influences link him to occult traditions (Covach 1992) that held relationships between sound and color in high regard. These considerations affect the interpretation of <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> and exemplify how historical perspectives on metaphors can inform music theoretical concepts.

The Chromatic Wedge as Formal Marker in Marion Bauer’s Duo for Oboe and Clarinet, op. 25
Though patriarchal structures contributed to the neglect of Marion Bauer’s music during her lifetime (1882–1955), contemporary scholars have begun to recognize its value. Recent book-length examinations assess Bauer’s output, but their scope allows only brief consideration of her style; conversely, detailed analyses of individual pieces support narrowly focused critical readings. I bridge this gap by defining the “chromatic wedge,” a gesture Bauer often employs to delineate sections, particularly in instrumental music of the 1920s and ’30s. The chromatic wedge combines linear chromatic motion comprising at least five pitches with a pedal tone, brief ostinato, or second chromatic line in contrary motion. My poster will examine its use as a salient marker of formal boundaries throughout the Duo for Oboe and Clarinet, op. 25. The Duo makes an illuminating case study, as the chromatic wedge unifies the four diverse movements. More broadly, when moving away from traditional tonality, Bauer might have retained the wedge as a way to retain closing function in the absence of fifth relationships. As such, the chromatic wedge became one important element uniting Bauer’s varied approaches to musical organization.

Follow the Solo: From Ritornello to Sonata-Form Concerto
This study examines the evolution of concerto first-movement form in the 18th century through a diachronic approach, using empirical corpus-based data. Present-day scholarship examines 18th-century concertos either through the Vivaldian baroque ritornello lens, or the Mozartean classical hybrid ritornello-sonata one, resulting in two distinct notions. The emergence of the latter from the former is rarely commented upon in any depth. Here, we examine this process relying both on descriptions of form throughout the 18th century and on an extensive corpus study comprising 210 concertos, composed between 1711 and 1789. Through analyzing tutti-solo alternations, thematic recurrences and the tonal trajectory, we argue that the concerto transformed through two important trends: the growing importance of the solos, and the movement reorganization in larger-scale units beyond the textural division. Specifically, we demonstrate that the increase in the concerto movement length occurred through the expansion of the opening ritornello, and the first and last solos. The middle and final ritornellos received decreasing roles, eventually regulated to mere solo articulation. We also show that a final tonic recapitulatory section, initiated by the main theme around three-fourths through the movement, was a common concerto procedure early on.
Although some of these trends have been noted both by contemporary (Quantz, Koch) and modern (Talbot, Caplin) theorists, the diachronic corpus-based approach presented here allows us to appreciate the process of change, to identify significant milestones during that process, and to provide a chronologically-sensitive framework for evaluating mid-century works on their own terms, rather than on those of Vivaldi or Mozart.

Pousseurian Mobile Form in
Production Library Music for Television
Due to an intricate power structure at play during an often lengthy composition and revision process, producers of background music for television frequently need to take a non-linear, mobile approach to writing music that is eventually perceived as being linear. While this mobile approach is reminiscent of those by Brown, Boulez, and Stockhausen, it correlates most strongly with Pousseur’s method of creating <i>Scambi</i> (1957), an avant-garde piece in which the composer discussed aiming for “complete continuity” by composing flexible modules with beginnings and endings that were “of like quality” that could be combined in several ways without transitions between them (Pousseur 1959).
In this poster presentation, I provide a “harmonic pathing model” (following Thomas 2016) that can be used in the composition of rock tracks for production libraries in order to ensure harmonic flow between sections despite any potential formal reordering, while adhering to principles of idiomatic progression in pop/rock genres as theorized by Christopher Doll (2017).
Following the introduction to my harmonic pathing model, I provide a meta-analysis of a corpus of 237 rock tracks from the Emmy-nominated RRHOT production library (CBS, CBS Sports), in which I discuss the degree to which pathing model adherence may play a role in overall track flexibility and, ultimately, library acceptance. Lastly, I discuss the broader implications of this harmonic pathing model, which provides a helpful pedagogical and compositional tool for pop/rock music more generally.

The Many Paths of Decolonization: Exploring Colonizing and Decolonizing Analyses of A Tribe Called Red's "How I Feel"
Despite ongoing calls for diversity in music theory pedagogy and analysis, for the decolonization of music research societies, and for the decolonization of academia more broadly, music theory seems slow to change. Perhaps this is partly because the field’s researchers are predominantly white and focused primarily on the repertoire and analytical techniques of Western Europe. Yet these should not be excuses. This poster calls the discipline to action, not by providing definitive answers, but by showing that decolonization begins by asking appropriate questions. Using a case analysis of “How I Feel” by Indigenous DJ collective A Tribe Called Red, I focus on a particular kind of decolonization, considering the relationship between a white settler researcher and Indigenous musicians in present-day Canada. I begin by presenting typical analytical starting places (the song’s large-scale form, pitch content, texture, and rapped flow) before explaining how the preliminary analysis (and the sketch of the discipline it represents) might be seen as colonial and insufficient, given the dominance of a particular culturally-situated understanding of music and analysis. Drawing from Indigenous and settler scholars in multiple disciplines, I explore several research questions that could rebalance the analysis, and by extension the discipline, toward decolonizing and Indigenizing musical perspectives. By outlining numerous analytical strategies, I present a view of decolonization as a process, open the discipline to multiple perspectives, and inspire action among theorists to reconsider biases and decolonize analysis in their own local contexts.

Post-Tonal Postcards: Synthesizing Analysis and
Reflection through Prose Writing
When first encountering post-tonal music, students discover repertoire that differs aesthetically from music they have previously studied and requires new analytical tools. To help students approach this repertoire with open minds, I frame my undergraduate post-tonal theory course as a virtual study-abroad experience with “postcard” assignments that synthesize analysis and reflection through prose writing. Each postcard includes a 300- to 500-word essay (message) and a single page of annotated musical examples (picture).
In their postcards, students analyze complete compositions through the lenses of specific themes. For example, students discuss pentatonic collections and pitch centricity (Debussy, “La fille aux cheveux de lin”), explain how imitation and z-cells provide unity and contrast (Bartók, “Chromatic Invention 1”), explore relationships among pitch-class sets (Webern, Op. 7, No. 3), and select their own repertoire to illustrate the course concepts they find most important. The underlying theoretical framework for these assignments comes from Self-Determination Theory, which includes intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as well as humans’ basic psychological need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
Students respond positively to the postcard assignments, developing creative titles as captions and sometimes formatting their assignments to look like real postcards. By addressing their postcards to different recipients (peer, novice, expert, and future self), students learn to communicate effectively in diverse rhetorical contexts. Additional pedagogical benefits include greater independence in music analysis and increased confidence in writing about music. With insightful analytical comments and language tailored to their intended recipients, the postcards become souvenirs of learning from students’ exploration of post-tonal music.

Metric Complexity

Influence of Bluegrass and Radiohead on
Metric Complexity in Punch Brothers
Punch Brothers is a progressive bluegrass ensemble whose work defies genre categorization, invoking styles as disparate as country, rock, and art music. Their music is often metrically complex, but this complexity presents an analytical challenge, owing to their varied genre influences. I propose a comparative genre analysis of metric complexity in Punch Brothers, drawing on metric conventions common in bluegrass and in the music of Radiohead.
Radiohead is often considered to be one of Punch Brothers’s biggest influences. I draw on Brad Osborn’s 2017 categorization of what he refers to as “metric salience” in Radiohead’s music to identify instances of metric complexity in Punch Brothers that are influenced by Radiohead. Building on Joti Rockwell’s (2011) exploration of metric disruptions in old-time country and bluegrass music, and James Palmer’s (2017) application of that work to Punch Brothers, I also characterize instances of metric complexity in Punch Brothers’s music that are primarily bluegrass-influenced. My comparison of these examples shows that Punch Brothers’s Radiohead-influenced metric complexity differs from their bluegrass-influenced metric complexity in three key ways: the use of non-isochronous (NI) meters, formal functions of metric disruptions, and preservation of the tactus.
It is my hope that this work will pave the way for future comparative genre analyses, both within individual musician’s work and across artists. Comparisons of generic conventions, especially in the under-studied area of meter, can help us determine the features of meter that are common to a specific genre, and those that are more broadly used across genres.

Hemiolas in Non-Isochronous Meters
A provocative title such as “Hemiolas in Non-Isochronous Meters” likely arouses skepticism. Indeed, non-isochronous meters are incompatible with Richard Cohn’s conception of hemiolas: “any successive or simultaneous conflict between a bisection and trisection of a single time-span.” To follow Cohn’s designation, grouping dissonance across the time-span of a 5/4 measure would need to be divided into two (2 1/2 quarter-notes) and three (1 2/3 quarter-notes), whereas in musical practice, 5/4 meters typically divide to 2+3 or 3+2 quarter-notes. Cohn recognizes the limitations of his methodology regarding non-isochronous pulses, which are addressed by Zachary Cairns. Cairns posits “shared-cardinality grouping dissonances” that occur in non-isochronous meters (i.e., 5/4 grouped as 2+3 vs. 5/4 grouped as 3+2 shown with Lerdahl/Jackendoff-style dots). Although Cairns’s methodology effectively illustrates occurrences of grouping dissonance involving non-isochronous pulses, it does not illuminate relative level of dissonance as Cohn does. Cohn addresses level of dissonance by expounding simple, double, and complex hemiolas, the latter defined as 2:3 conflict occurring at three or more metrical levels. This poster brings together Cairns’s discussions of shared-cardinality grouping dissonance and Cohn’s discussions of hemiolas by modifying Cohn’s metric states and metric space visuals to allow for non-isochronous pulses. These modifications illuminate metrical conflict in a variety of repertoires, including Holst’s “Mars” from <i>The Planets</i>, Gabriel Pierné’s Piano Quintet, no. 41, and Heitor Villa-Lobos’s <i>Próle do Bébé</i>, no. 2.

The Myhill Property: The Strong vs. the Weak
It is shown that the Myhill Property of diatonic set theory has a less strict version: the Weak Myhill Property (WMP), contrasted with the standard definition denoted as the Strong Myhill Property (SMP). This weak version applies to a more comprehensive, mathematical group of tonal structures, including the three tonal scale systems named by Hungarian theorist Lajos Bárdos as <i>Heptatonia Prima</i> (H1), <i>Heptatonia Secunda</i> (H2), and <i>Heptatonia Tertia</i> (H3). All three scale systems have a distinct Circle of Modes (each consisting of 84 scales with 7 distinct modes in all 12 keys). Only the Circle of Modes from our traditional diatonic scales (H1) can be constructed by a single chromatic alteration to each scale in the circle. This is a consequence of SMP. The Circle of Modes for H2 and H3, on the other hand, can only be constructed by a net chromatic alteration; a consequence of WMP. Even though it is impossible to transpose any scale within H2 or H3 by altering a single pitch chromatically, as their key structures are more complex than H1, it is possible to transpose these scales systematically through all four heptatonic scales (H0, H1, H2, and H3) if taken together. By raising only one pitch at a time by a half-step, these scales form a new mathematical group, the Heptatonic Circle, resulting directly from WMP. From these constructions, we conclude that WMP warrants further investigation by music theorists and deserves a rigorous treatment in mathematical music theory.

Can a Leaf Make Music? Techniques and Aesthetics of
Plant-Generated CV in Electronic Music
Research has revealed that plants are more electrically active than previously thought, producing and transmitting both action potential (AP) and variation potential (VP) through their tissues. Seeking to harness this novel source of electrical activity, composers, improvisers, and commercial companies have constructed innovative devices that convert biological electrical signaling into MIDI control codes or control voltage (CV). In this way, plants can trigger or modify sounds in an electronic synthesizer or computer.
Our project has two branches. First, we investigate the question of how and why plants produce and transmit electrical signals, based on a large and growing corpus of research in the biological sciences. We provide a novel catalog of how various species of common plants generate AP/VP under different environmental conditions.
Second, we interrogate aesthetic questions around human responses to plant-structured music. Much of this music shares common stylistic characteristics. We situate the practice in a broader cultural landscape. What is it, to compose or improvise music with non-human collaborators? How does our bias—reflected in plants’ “othering” in taxonomic systems dating back to Aristotle and Linnaeus—influence our response? How can human communities create music together by interacting with the environment?
Our work on these problems has resulted in several profitable and successful collaborations between our team and colleagues in the STEM fields at our respective universities. The poster session includes a live demonstration of “plant music,” using three modular synthesizers and several species of plants. We invite you to come by and interact with the greenery!

Musical Topics in Mozart’s Piano Sonatas:
A Data Science Approach
Extending from the work of Ratner, Agawu, and Monelle, recent scholarship in topic theory has set to more clearly define the musical elements that create a topic. Contributions from Rumph and Frymoyer provide ways of considering the constituent elements of a topic (<i>figurae</i>) both in isolation and in relation to one another. The resulting lists of <i>figurae</i> not only aid analysts in understanding topics but also suggest that these features could be identified in a machine-learning context. In this interactive poster session, we will show the promising results of our first forays into computational analysis of musical topics. Specifically, our findings demonstrate applications of data science methods that have implications for both further analytical inquiry and the dissemination of research concerning musical topics.
Our data science approach included the steps of data gathering and cleaning, exploratory visualization and analysis, and predictive modeling. After completing an analysis of the topoi in Mozart’s piano sonatas by measure, we combined humdrum formatted versions of the scores and the music21 music analysis software library to extract a wealth of features about each analytical segment. In addition, we have used early data visualizations to help identify areas for further exploration; these visualization tools suggest new ways of considering the presentation of information about topics in general, as well as the topics within Mozart’s piano sonatas specifically. Finally, we have begun to use the extracted data to develop predictive models of topics within the sonatas.

"Mutated Octaves" in 20th-Century and
Contemporary Orchestration
As harmonic practice expanded beyond the sonorities of common-practice tonality, the range of textures and colors available to orchestral composers likewise grew. The relationship between harmony and color in this context is a complicated one, and lines between the two are not always clearly defined. This paper starts from the hypothesis that timbral listening is an inherently embodied, ecological, and mimetic mode of listening, and proceeds to explore a particular orchestrational/harmonic technique found in 20th-century and contemporary orchestral literature: “mutated octaves,” a variant of traditional doublings at the octave that injects additional pitch classes into the octave. Mutated octaves are part compositional technique and part perceptual phenomenon. As perceptual phenomenon, mutated octaves can be classified according to the level of perceptual fusion they elicit. The varying levels of perceptual fusion—high, medium, and low—correlate with the vertical intervallic structures found in the sonority. In addition to offering a fresh perspective on the harmonic techniques at play in such passages, the experience of “mutated octaves” implicitly offers a critique to the score-as-text approach to music analysis; by grounding the analysis as an aural- rather than ocular-centric approach, the act of hearing mutated octaves in the music places the listening subject’s relationship with the performers on equal footing with the score per se.

Unmasking the "Foreign Body:" Large-scale Formal Process and Microtonal Language in Georg F. Haas’s String Quartet No. 1
Georg Friedrich Haas (1999) defines four categories of microtonality: equally-tempered divisions of the octave or other intervals, intervals derived from the overtone series, near-unison intervals, (<i>Klangspaltung</i>, tone- or sound- splitting), and aleatoric techniques. Haas then discusses the compositional design of his Quartet No. 1, describing a “foreign body” that gradually infiltrates the descending shapes of the beginning. It eventually surfaces with greatest clarity two-thirds of the way through the composition, thus “removing its mask.” Once revealed, the foreign body begins to decay, obscuring its identity in future appearances.
I trace the path of the foreign body—the acoustically tuned dominant seventh chord—as it intertwines with other microtonal types. Close inspection of each appearance of the foreign body unveils a large-scale formal process through a background progression of these chords spanning the entire composition. While initial appearances of the chord seem arbitrary, they are in fact guided proportionally according to the golden ratio, and are used to structure the first half.
Haas’s use of microtonal types in this work create contrast that can aid a listener in perceiving structures and making large-scale connections. However, the question of understanding certain microtonal sonorities remains open. I contemplate different options for interpreting such sonorities and suggest that Hass’s microtonal types can lead to reconsideration of microtonal harmony. This paper extends the work of Hasegawa (2015), who analyzes the juxtaposition of intonation modes in two further works by Haas, and complements analyses of microtonal language as in Elster (1991), Gann (1993), Gilmore (1995), and Werntz (2001).

Brad Gersh (Princeton University)
Listening to Sensory Dissonance Through Time in
American Minimalism
Recent work by Damian Blättler, Daniel Harrison, and others has drawn attention to the complex, interacting effects of intervals within a chord. A wide dissonance, for example, may seem softer when divided into smaller consonances, and a consonant interval might be challenged by other dissonances to varying degrees. Such vertical effects become prominent when a static sonority is sustained as a drone or changes only gradually, as in some music by Webern, Messiaen, Ligeti, and Reich. A more flexible method to describe the interactions of tones within a static chord would thus be useful.
In this paper, I propose one step toward this goal through a revision of William Sethares’s model of sensory dissonance. Sethares’s procedure, which is influenced by Helmholtz, computes a score representing the total strength of dissonant partials in the spectrum of a chord. In a similar manner, we might compute a score of “consonant,” overlapping partial-pairs. The ratio of these scores allows us to compare the relative dissonance of chords of any cardinality, and corrects an artifact, the excessive decline in predicted dissonance as intervals increase in size.
Relative dissonance can take a form-building function, as reflected in this ratio. Arvo Pärt’s <i>Fratres</i> shows an arch form with an apex in relative dissonance coinciding with the loudest dynamic; this dissonance pattern may be more perceptible to an auditor than the process that generates it. Likewise, Section I of Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians reaches a rhetorical climax just where relative dissonance reaches a local nadir.


FRIDAY MORNING SESSIONS—9:00–12:15
ANALYZING THE MUSIC OF THOMAS ADÈS
(HARRISON)
Yayoi Uno Everett (The University of Illinois at Chicago), Chair
This special session focuses on the music of the British composer Thomas Adès (b. 1971). A roll-call of the awards and recognition for Adès demonstrates the global appeal of his music. Given the prominence and unarguable success of Adès’s music, it is not surprising that he has been subject to far greater musicological attention than many of his peers. A positive review in <i>The New York Times</i> by Richard Taruskin of Adès’s music became an early reference point. Taruskin argues that “for all its precocious technical sophistication and its omnivorous range of reference […] it does not put everything ‘in quotes.’ It has urgency and fervor, and communicates directly” (Taruskin 1999/2000, 145).
In the last 15 years, there has been a growing body of articles, book chapters, and theses and dissertations dedicated to, or featuring, Adès’s music. The six papers in this integrated special session add to this growing body of scholarly work. The session is timely, in that it occurs some two decades after the publication of Taruskin’s review, enabling the contributors to take stock of the evolving body of work dedicated to Adès, and to point to future directions for the growing field of Adès studies. In this way, it will be ideally positioned to make a significant contribution to the literature on Adès’s music.

Automatism and Tonal Discombobulation in the
Mazurkas of Thomas Adès
Thomas Adès often suffuses his music with transformations of music past and present. His penchant for producing discombobulated representations of other music—as in the macabre cancan of <i>Lieux retrouvés</i>; the warped “Dies irae” in <i>Totentanz</i>; or the distorted rave of “Ecstasio”—has caused numerous critics to remark on the music’s surrealist qualities (Taruskin 2009; Fox 2004; Massey 2012, Service 2012; Cooper 2017; Venn 2017). These re-makings of specific works, styles, and genres are matched by similar transformations of generic and familiar sounds and patterns, like the discombobulating (016) that follows the tonic and dominant chords that begin the Piano Quintet (Stoecker 2014). Common to each mode of allusion is the underlying presence of defamiliarization. Adès’s music constantly renders familiar sounds strange, uncanny, and, on occasion, bizarre. Drawing primarily from his four recent mazurkas, this paper explores techniques that Adès uses to meld abstract patterns to generic tonal objects like triads and scales, and it situates these techniques alongside two axioms of surrealist art and music from the 1920s and ’30s, defamiliarization and automatism. I show how these fusions fundamentally transform his mazurkas by creating local, large-scale, and structural distortions of familiar musical processes and methods of organization.


Philip Stoecker (Hofstra University)
Paths, Spirals, and Extraordinary Cycles:
The Chaconne in Thomas Adès’s Violin Concerto
Thomas Adès has often described the use of repetitive patterns and cycles in his music. Analyses by Roeder (2006, 2009, and 2014), Stoecker (2014, 2015, and 2016), Travers (2004), and Venn (2006, 2014, and 2017) have shown how Adès’s pitch patterns govern local, small-scale events. Venn further notes that “Adès frequently combines or extends [pitch cycles] in order to generate larger structures or even the premise behind entire movements” (2017a, 23). Building upon their work, this paper focuses on a large-scale form in Adès’s music—a somewhat neglected corner of scholarship to date—and the ways in which Adès uses pitch and rhythmic cycles to create a chaconne. This paper, then, focuses on the chaconne in the central movement of Adès’s Violin Concerto (2005).
According to Adès, “[a] chaconne is simply one kind of harmonic motion. In my music it’s very often spiral rather than circular—in other words, it’s transposed down with each appearance …” (Adès and Service 2012, 7–8). Although Adès’s comments emphasize pitch rather than rhythm, this paper focuses on the temporal structures of Adès’s chaconne and how the solo violin sometimes agrees with, and sometimes contradicts with, the rhythmic continuities projected by the larger-scale harmonic progression of the chaconne. To date, the rhythmic structure of “Paths,” the central movement of the concerto, has been overlooked. This paper will thus demonstrate how Adès creates conflicts between the “stable,” spiraling chaconne progression and the rhythmically dissonant solo violin.

A World in Constant Motion: Thomas Adès’s <i>In Seven Days</i>
Critic Joshua Kosman noted that Thomas Adès’s <i>In Seven Days: Piano Concerto with Moving Image </i>(2008) “seems to want to embrace the whole world.” The concerto outlines the Biblical creation story in seven connected movements, accompanied by coordinated projections by video artist Tal Rosner based on images of the two venues that commissioned the work (London’s Royal Festival Hall and Los Angeles’s Disney Hall). <i>In Seven Days</i> merges the figurative and the abstract to parallel modern allegorical readings of Biblical creation. A theme and series of seven variations outline successive “days” illustrated by specific musical devices, the whole divided into two halves that appear to follow the framework interpretation of Genesis.
The musical allegory presented by <i>In Seven Days</i> suggests a creation shaped as much by implicit scientific principles as the theological notion of a supreme being. The piano functions in this context less as a virtuosic soloist than a guiding force, a “consciousness” that directs the expansion of the work, drives the generation of harmonic and rhythmic patterns, and occasionally arrives, in medias res, to comment on the work of creation. A separate musical narrative runs in parallel to the narrative of Biblical creation—one shaped by the refinement of Western musical techniques, such as canon, which themselves display a cyclical history of musical development from early polyphony through 20th-century modernism and minimalism. Hence, the paper concludes by demonstrating that the “whole world” of <i>In Seven Days</i> embraces a musical creation myth as well.

How You Speak to Me: Word Setting in Thomas Adès’s
<i>Powder Her Face</i> (1995)
Philip Hensher (2008) has spoken of the way in which his libretto to Thomas Adès’s first opera<i>, Powder Her Face</i> (1995), was influenced by Wayne Koestenbaum’s 1993 discussion of the operatic silencing of women’s voices. The opera’s protagonist, the Duchess of Argyll, is accordingly silenced twice—first in a notorious “fellatio” aria, and second, figuratively, through her eviction in the final scene from the hotel in which she was living. Critical responses to the opera have extended this premise to demonstrate how such silencings are mobilized within patriarchal and class-based systems (Gallon 2011; Stevens 2017). To date, however, much less attention has been given to the Duchess’s sounding voice within the framework of these silencing elements, to the detriment of a fuller understanding of her as a musical and dramatic agent.
This paper will offer a theoretical model for analyzing Adès’s shifting approach to word-setting in response to the varying demands of dramatic situation and musical imperatives, illustrated with reference to the Duchess’s music in the first and final scenes of <i>Powder Her Face</i>. The distinctiveness of the Duchess’s voice through all these shifting contexts is such that the hotel maid can mimic her vocal mannerisms, prompting the Duchess to exclaim “How you speak to me!,”while simultaneously reinforcing how the Duchess speaks to us. Given the importance Adès has placed on text-setting (Adès and Service 2012), an approach to prosody and word-setting in his music is long overdue.

The RICH logic of Thomas Adès’s
<i>The Exterminating Angel</i> and <i>The Tempest</i>
Thomas Adès described the composition of his operas <i>The Tempest</i> (2003) and <i>The Exterminating Angel</i> (2016) as the “organic, necessary” linking of “tiny cells” into larger structures by a “musical logic.” Observations by Cao, Gallon, and Venn suggest that the pertinent cells are simply dyads. This paper demonstrates how, in both operas, the logic of the dyad successions is a transformational one, consisting of retrograde-inversion chaining (RICH).
In <i>The Tempest</i>, the basis for the RICH chain is a voice leading of a perfect fifth to a minor third. Reiterating RICH thrice carries the progression back to the initial dyad, forming a short cycle, which Adès assembles into larger cyclic structures that endow each dyad with an ensemble of possible continuations, closures, denials, and surprises. The chains direct the protagonists’ musics in ways that express Prospero’s power and Caliban’s resistance.
Such RICH logic, applied to different materials, also permeates <i>The Exterminating Angel</i>. In this case the RI-chaining constitutes an octatonic structure that in some passages may be heard to represent the eponymous force that dissipates the characters’ will. But the progression is also used to underwrite more purely musical structures. For instance, it generates the tonal plan of the Act I lovers’ duet, and it coordinates pitch, rhythm, tonality, and form in the “Fugue of Panic.” Most dramatically significant, though, is the role that RI-chains play in the pivotal moment of the opera, when Leticia’s defiant singing releases the guests from the “abulia” that traps them.

Living Toys in Adès's <i>Living Toys</i>:
Transforming the Post-Tonal Topic
This paper introduces a model of topics as a dynamic interactive process in post-tonal music. A freedom from tonal syntax allows a larger range of potential topical relationships. To analyze these, I introduce the analytical method of Topical Networks. First, I establish topical hierarchies (the Elementary, Intermediary, and Actant levels) and, through mapping transformational networks onto levels of topical characteristics, I model relationships between topics. Applying concepts from the literary semiotic theories of Greimas (1966) and Eco (1976, 1980), I ally these models onto broader narrative models. The degree and nature of such relationships can be mapped across a work, demonstrating how topical interactions can guide expressive form.
I apply this method to the opening three movements of Thomas Adès’s <i>Living Toys</i> (1993). A descending chromatic line is transformed through an aligned cycle to become an obsessively repeated reference to “Three Blind Mice.” Through retrograde and expansion, this becomes the Hero topic; continuing such a process, I create networks of five topics in the opening three movements. I adopt categories of troping from Hatten (2014) (productivity, compatibility, dominance) to describe such instances of isolated interaction. I then trace the changing relationships across networks, mapping semantically-significant developments and the dynamic treatment of the musical objects. Adding a temporal dimension is suggestive of a narrative reading, leading to a reflection upon this method within the broader historical context and motivations of the semiotic theories.

How do I know if administration is right for me? When during my career is the right time to consider an administrative position? How do I balance teaching, research, and administration? How do I keep a connection to music and to music theory alive in an administrative position? How do I prepare to be a successful applicant for an administrative position? What are the skills necessary to being a successful administrator? What do administrators in various roles do?
These questions form the focus of this session. Mid-career music theorists may be interested in administrative positions, as our field’s penchant for analysis and structured thinking predisposes us to the kinds of tasks administration requires. This session aims to demystify the transition to administration, and to help scholars make an informed decision about seeking or accepting an administrative role.
The session will begin with presentations by four theorists whose career trajectories have taken them into administrative positions, followed by a discussion period among the panelists that includes questions from the audience. Our goal is that attendees will leave the session with a clearer idea of how they might navigate career opportunities in administration, as well as the joys and challenges those opportunities represent.

METER, FLOW, AND GROOVE IN HIP HOP (MCKINLEY)

Metric Transformations in Hip-Hop and R&B Sampling Practice
This paper explores the possibilities of metric transformation when one song samples material from another. Most commonly associated with hip-hop and electronic dance music, and part of the broader tradition of musical “borrowing,” sampling has offered a rich framework for investigations into intertextuality, legality, ethics, and advancements in music-making technology (Katz 2004; Schloss 2004; Williams 2013). Few analyses to date, however, have examined in detail the ways that existing materials are transformed metrically in new settings.
Drawing on examples from Pusha T, A Tribe Called Quest, Jeru the Damaja, and Frank Ocean that feature prominent “structural samples” (Sewell 2013, 26), I theorize four categories of sample-transforming techniques that can be employed singly or in combination: tempo shift, which can also affect pitch and timbre; “chopping,” the cutting-up and reordering of a sample; truncation, the reduction of a sample’s metric unit; and recontextualization, which involves a re-casting from one meter to another. Transcription-based comparisons between these samples and their sources (which range from Jack DeJohnette to MGMT) reveal how producers use these techniques to both articulate and problematize features such as phrase structure, hypermeter, and metric accent (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983). The craft of rappers in manipulating rhythmic and metric structures in their vocal delivery, or “flow,” is by now well recognized; this paper turns our attention to a similar craft in their sample-based accompaniments.

Segmentation and Phrasing in Hip-Hop Flow
This paper investigates segmentation and phrasing in the rapped vocals, or flow, of hip-hop music. The main—but by no means the only—techniques MCs (rappers) use to organize lyrics into flow are rhyme, rhythm, breath patterning, and syntactic closure. Ohriner (2016) notes that rhyme, syntactic closure, and breathing are usually the most prevalent markers of such organization, but he suggests that using each of these markers to analytically segment a passage of flow would reveal different segmentation structures for the same passage. I explore this issue by undertaking a segmentation-based analysis of passages of flow drawn from old-school (1979–85), Golden-Age (1986–93), and late-1990s hip-hop music, using examples from Roxanne Shanté, Eric B. & Rakim, and The Notorious B.I.G. to suggest that flow styles emerging in the Golden Age and onward increasingly feature passages that produce multiple, divergent segmentations depending on the criteria used to segment them. These divergences complicate efforts to define what constitutes a phrase of flow, a complex notion explored by Condit-Schultz (2016) and Adams (2017), but otherwise only receiving implicit definition or passing mention in recent hip-hop scholarship. Adapting the work of Rothstein (1989), Attas (2011), and Condit-Schultz, I propose a method of discerning flow phrases by considering the aural salience of segmentation markers, the groupings these markers suggest, the internal, motional characteristics of these groupings, and their metric relationship with the song’s beat layer (sampled or instrumental accompaniment).

Metric Complexity, Lyric, and Groove in
Selected Verses of Eminem
This presentation reframes the concept of groove in the rapping voice and introduces the concept of the groove class. Following Cohn’s “Platonic” funky rhythms, a groove, in my construal, is an idealized, repeating combination of inter-accent durations, restricted to two or three 16th-notes, that sum to one measure. Further, I introduce an algorithmic segmenter that partitions a rapped verse into groove sequences. This algorithm selects from all viable grooves at a given moment, prioritizing those that are longer and more conformant to the sounding accentual pattern.
These grooves differ in metric complexity, a summation of the metric “weakness” of those positions within the meter that carry accent. In three analyses, I demonstrate Eminem’s use of this variable metric complexity, showing how trajectories of metric complexity mirror narratives within his lyrics both within and between verses in a track. This construal of groove and the algorithmic segmentation method has potential for theorists of rhythm in other groove-based musics. More so, the analyses in this presentation form a bridge between approaches to analyzing rap from the perspectives of musical rhythm and poetry. While these approaches have much to offer each other, as yet they rarely intersect.

Metrical Dissonance and Hypermeter in Schubert's Sonata Forms
This paper explores a particular kind of interaction between metrical dissonance and phrase rhythm in Schubert’s sonata forms. By integrating theoretical concepts derived from Harald Krebs with the model of sonata form developed by James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, I explore how metrical dissonance and “hypermetric subliminal dissonance”—a type of phrase rhythm that is specifically associated with the subliminal dissonance—can be heard to shape the structures and processes of Schubert’s sonatas. To demonstrate such interaction between metrical dissonance and phrase rhythm in sonata form, this paper analyzes the first movements of three instrumental works by Schubert: the Piano Sonata in E Minor, D. 566; the Piano Trio in E-flat Major, D. 929; and the Piano Sonata in C Minor, D. 958.
These works share three strategies of metrical dissonance: to articulate formal boundaries, to expand and so loosen a theme, and to destabilize progressions that lead to structural cadences. Meanwhile, I argue that the particular metrical dissonances used in these pieces proceed in tandem with the teleological trajectories of tonality characteristic of sonata form.
In sum, this study contributes to a growing literature on temporal relationships in music of the early 19th century (Hyland 2016; Krebs 1999 and 2014; VonFoerster 2011). Apart from its examination of metrical dissonance, this study also seeks to fill a gap in our understanding of the relationship between phrase rhythm and sonata form in Schubert’s music, a relationship that has been substantially investigated in other repertoires (Ng 2012; Rothstein 1989; Temperley 2008).

Diatonic Indeterminacy and Double Returns in Schubert's
Piano Sonata in B-flat Major, D. 960, i
This paper explores how form and cadential closure can affect our perception of musical passages that cross an enharmonic seam, particularly in cases where the relationships between harmonies or tonal regions can be construed as diatonically indeterminate. Using Tovey’s (1928) discussion of Schubert’s Piano Sonata in G Major, D. 894, as a point of departure, I consider two related passages from the Piano Sonata in B-flat Major, D. 960, i (mm. 1–80 and 216–258), both of which feature the same enharmonic juncture. For each passage, I compare a diatonic hearing to a neo-Riemannian one, using Caplin’s theory of formal functions (1998) and cadential closure (2004, 2018) as a heuristic guide. I suggest that a diatonic and neo-Riemannian hearing can converge in the second passage from D. 960, because the double return of the reprise and home key within the main theme’s apparent ternary design confirms the global tonic, B-flat major, regardless of the enharmonic shift. With respect to the first passage from D. 960, I propose that the two hearings of the tonal regions may diverge; closure in both F-sharp minor and A major can encourage us to regard the exposition’s final region, F major, as diatonically remote from the global tonic. Repeating the exposition not only restores the link between these two regions, but also invites us to reconfigure the tonal relationships perceived in our initial hearing. My paper concludes by contemplating the value of diatonic indeterminacy and by considering how the two hearings of the first passage can be complementary.

Foreshadowing Strategies in Schubert's Three-Key Expositions
Few of Schubert’s evocative compositional moments have attracted more attention than the G-flat trill at the start of the D. 960. The trill first interrupts the primary theme by emphasizing a chromatic pitch through texture, rhythm, dynamics, and register. Its disruptive nature has led many authors to turn to narrative explanations when accounting for it. Fisk (2001) and Pesic (1999), for instance, personify the piece as a wanderer that journeys through the exposition’s large-scale harmonic plan—the trill portending the protagonist’s banishment into the second tonal area’s (2TA’s) F-sharp minor tonality similarly to Edward T. Cone’s promissory note.
Though the trill is not exactly a promissory note, Fisk and Pesic’s narrative demonstrates that hearing certain tonal events of the exposition as arising from an initial portentous event can offer a compelling way to understand an exposition’s trajectory. Authors commonly invoke such foreshadowing narratives in readings of Schubert’s music, particularly his songs. Despite this, only a few scholars have explored the role of foreshadowing devices in Schubert’s three-key expositions, and of those, all have focused on explaining the generically unexpected key of the 2TA.
Foreshadowing strategies and their concomitant narratives, however, can effectively shape our hearings of many of Schubert’s three-key expositions in far more varied ways than simply explaining 2TAs. This talk will use D. 814/i and D. 537/iii to demonstrate two such instances. In doing so, my hope is to begin illuminating the range of narrative possibilities inherent in these expositional structures.

"A-Five, Six, Seven, Eight!": Musical Counting and Dance Hemiolas in Musical Theatre Tap Dance Breaks
“A-five, six, seven, eight!” Those four numbers in the opening of <i>A Chorus Line</i> (1976) often announce the beginning of musical theatre dance routines. Choreographic phrases often follow an 8-beat paradigm to match the larger musical hypermeter. However, more complex rhythmic structures are commonly found in Broadway choreography, where steps and groups of steps do not closely align with musical phrases. These “Dance Hemiolas,” as I term them, usually occur near places of formal delineation in the music. Tap dancing intensifies this potential metric “dissonance” (following Krebs, 1999) as sounds created by the dancers’ shoes create another rhythmic instrumental layer. Changes in the relationships between the metrical layers can create heightened energy. This paper explores examples from two Broadway-style tap dance breaks to show how Dance Hemiolas combine with musical rhythms to generate momentum and delineate formal structures.
In the 1992 musical <i>Crazy For You</i> with music by George Gershwin, Susan Stroman’s choreography uses traditional tap dance steps in classic and new ways, featuring many Dance Hemiolas at structural positions. In the finale to <i>Billy Elliot Live</i> (2005/2014), the rousing conclusion of the dance break is created by accumulating dancers, repetition of groups of simple steps, and Dance Hemiolas. These examples show how dancers’ on-stage movements and rhythmic tap sounds combine with musical rhythms and phrases to create energy and strengthen structural climaxes. By showing analytical insights gained from a closer look at choreo-musical rhythmic movements, this paper offers an innovative investigative tool for scholars who seek multivalent understanding.

Choreographic Revelations:
“Dance Music,”According to Two Historical Dance Theorists
When it plays a role in musical analysis at all, dance often serves as an imaginary enhancement of a primarily musical experience. For instance, topical analysis interprets “dance” topoi as sonic cues that invoke the memory or specter of courtly dance to expressively animate instrumental or vocal music. Even some choreo-musical analyses tend to portray dance as a commentary or “visualization” of the score—an auxiliary to the music itself. But what would musicians and audiences learn if we were to turn this perspective on its head?
In this talk, I consult the treatises of two influential dance theorists—Carlo Blasis (1797–1878) and Fyodor Lopukhov (1886–1973)—to reposition the analysis of dance and its musical accompaniment through a primarily choreographic lens. While roughly a century separates the two authors, both discuss “classical” ballet technique and choreography in terms that may seem at once familiar and unsettling to musicians. Through examples of standard ballet class exercises and excerpts from <i>Giselle</i>, <i>La Bayadère</i>, and <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, I highlight instances in which Blasis and Lopukhov have appropriated musical concepts and nomenclature (e.g. "adagio," "petit allegro," and even "sonata form") to delineate strictly choreographic elements and processes. As a foil to established analytical methods, where music recalls or contains imagined dances, these two dance theorists offer an appealing counterpoint: that choreographed dance contains—and dictates—imagined “music.”

Finding the Salsa Beat from the Positional Perspective
of the Dancing Salsero/a
In their 2007 study, Phillips-Silver/Trainor demonstrated how physical movement has the power to shape aural perception of meter, showing that it was not enough to observe physical movement; in order for participants to hear an aural stimulus in the meter of a given movement pattern, they had to embody it themselves. Following other recent attempts to broaden how music theorists approach analysis, this paper investigates ways in which a dancer’s unique listening perspective provides insights into the musical structure of salsa songs—insights that would not be made without such an embodied experience. To illustrate this approach, I will examine the song “Yaye Boy” in some detail. The initial lack of percussion in Cuban group Orquesta Aragón’s arrangement highlights the metric ambiguity of the opening melodic line, making the interpretive job of the dancer particularly difficult as none of the musical accents align with the entry points of the possible basic footwork patterns. While NY/Senegalese group Africando’s arrangement clarifies the location of the downbeat, supporting the ambiguous melodic line with the interlocking percussion patterns typical of salsa, this arrangement soon highlights a larger-scale hypermetric irregularity in the song’s phrase lengths. Because the footwork pattern is a hypermetric cycle spanning two measures of music, dancers are acutely aware of and affected by disruptions in phrase structure. Through their physical interactions with such frequently occurring moments of disorientation in salsa, dancers may either increase the tension of or help to reconcile metric conflicts, adding exciting interpretive layers to the art form.

Four Steps Toward Parnassus: Johann David Heinichen's
Method of Keyboard Improvisation as a Model of
Baroque Compositional Pedagogy
Johann David Heinichen’s treatise, <i>Der General-Bass in der Composition</i> (Dresden, 1728), is the most comprehensive study of thoroughbass ever written, yet it has been continually overshadowed in historical accounts by two works published in the same decade: Rameau’s <i>Traité de l’Harmonie</i> (1722) and Fux’s <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i> (1725). Despite receiving some attention by Buelow (1966) and Holtmeier (2007), it seems <i>Der General-Bass</i> has yet to receive wider acclaim because it lacks a reductive pedagogical framework that can rival Rameau’s <i>basse fondamentale</i> or Fux’s species in simplicity and immediate appeal. Fortunately, the “partimento renaissance” of the last decade has brought renewed attention to the centrality of thoroughbass in 18th-century music-making. Thus, the time is ripe for a reappraisal of Heinichen’s monumental work. At least once, Heinichen does in fact outline a pedagogical method of eminent simplicity on par with Rameau’s and Fux’s theories: his four-step instruction in how to improvise a prelude at the keyboard. These four steps toward Parnassus build in complexity by permuting two factors: (1) conjunct vs. disjunct basslines with (2) consonant vs. dissonant harmonies. According to Heinichen, this method, which seems to be completely unknown today, is to be understood not only as instruction in improvising, but also as training for beginning composers. Therefore, in explicating the pedagogy of one of 18th-century Europe’s leading composer-theorists, this paper makes a contribution to both the historically-informed analysis and the practical instruction of baroque music today.

Beethoven Contra Partimento: Creativity, Aesthetics,
and the <i>schöne Künste</i> in a Realization of BWV 908
The international “new theory” (Sanguinetti 2014) formed of schemata and partimenti has painted a powerful picture of musical creativity in the long 18th century, one centered on the close imitation of models. The Neapolitan conservatories and Italian diaspora have placed partimento schooling especially center stage. The coherence of this picture, however, owes to generalizations about the whole (creativity) from a particular (craft-training). My paper problematizes 18th-century musical creativity by positioning Beethoven, as composer and metaphor for a German tradition, in counterpoint with the world of partimento in two interrelated ways: one aesthetic-philosophical, the other practical.
The creative mechanism advanced by the “new theory” is foreign to the musical aesthetics and values into which Beethoven was born: the creative process has been described in terms of “automatic composition” (Sanguinetti 2012), “transcription” (Gjerdingen 2007), and “memes going viral” (Gjerdingen and Bourne 2015). Meanwhile, Beethoven’s earliest training with Christian Gottlob Neefe in Bonn is reflected in Johann Georg Sulzer’s <i>Allgemeine Theorie</i> (1771–74). Its creative and aesthetic categories, which include “originality,” “invention,” and “variety” in “unity,” are values that Neefe (1783, 1785) “put in [Beethoven’s] hands” at a young age, along with <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>.
Drawing on the “historical imagination” (Treitler 1989), I creatively imagine how Beethoven might have implemented Sulzer’s aesthetic categories in a realization of Bach’s partimento-fantasia from BWV 908, and how this differs from modern partimento-trained solutions and the first published realization by Carl Czerny (1839). Differences among these realizations throw dichotomies within 18th-century musical thought into sharp relief.

Teaching by Example: “Practical” Pedagogies of the
Postclassical Thoroughbass
Is it possible to learn thoroughbass without memorizing any written rules? This paper examines two Viennese thoroughbass treatises that lack any written rules: Simon Sechter’s <i>Generalbass-Schule</i> (1835) and Carl Czerny’s <i>Studien zur praktischen Kenntniss aller Accorde des Generalbasses</i> (1854). Instead of listing rules and providing skeletal basslines, the treatises present only fully-realized chord progressions—and in Czerny’s case, even some exercises that could be described as idiomatic piano etudes. This represents an approach to thoroughbass pedagogy that I term the “practical thoroughbass,” which I claim played a driving role in determining the post-classical musical style. The students of Sechter and Czerny (who include Schubert and Liszt) may owe their flashiest and most idiosyncratic effects to the practical thoroughbass.
Using the language of cognitive skill acquisition, this paper describes how the two treatises differ in method from the more familiar 18th-century partimento tradition. Unlike their 18th-century precursors, Sechter and Czerny do not need their readers to become adept at realizing a bass with figures. But despite this dissimilarity, the practical thoroughbass and the partimento tradition share the goal of turning thoroughbass rules into a broad structure for elaboration. I then show how Sechter and Czerny musically prioritize two aspects of skill acquisition: example-centeredness and generalization. The practical thoroughbass represents just one position in a century-long debate over whether thoroughbass was a performerly skill, a compositional theory, or some hybrid of both.

Hearing the Inaudible in Dutilleux's <i>Métaboles</i>
The French term <i>métabole</i> is most often used today to designate metamorphosing insects, but it has several interesting historical definitions, such as (1) a rhetorical device in which a word reappears within a passage but is in some way altered, and (2) a musical operation, such as a metrical shift or a modal modulation. In addition to repeatedly characterizing his 1964 orchestral work<i> Métaboles</i> in terms of one or another of these definitions, Dutilleux emphasized the potential for such transformations to generate “real” or “essential” change. In one interview, he even outlines a precise mechanism: “A certain sound event, sometimes very brief and unidentifiable in the moment,” he explains, “will settle in the unconscious of the listener and play its role <i>a posteriori</i>.” In this paper, I argue that <i>Métaboles </i>enacts a comparable process and that Dutilleux’s idiosyncratic use of the 12-tone method is crucial to its execution. More specifically, I argue that, in the final movement’s reprise, the row becomes a catalyst that sends shock waves throughout the piece, forcing a retrospective reconsideration of everything that came before. I first interpret the opening movement in terms of collections, inversional relations, voice leading patterns, etc., and then move on to describing the properties of the row, which is derived from set-class (016) and strongly suggests interaction with an ic1/6 Tonnetz. Finally, I show how the reprise’s relation to this construct reveals a surprising connection between it and the rest of the piece, including the very opening.

Competing Musical Processes in Parisian Modernist Sonata Forms
The first movements of Milhaud’s Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Clarinet and Piano, Ravel’s Sonata for Violin and Piano, and Martinů’s Sextet for Winds and Piano are in sonata form with truncated recapitulation, that is, they begin with normative sonata expositions but their recapitulations do not produce the secondary theme. This violates the most basic norm of sonata form, but whereas this would register as a catastrophic deformation in a 19th-century work, these three Parisian-modernist pieces are not cataclysmic in affect and all blithely end in the major mode.
This paper demonstrates that these pieces feature goal-directed processes, running in parallel to sonata-form logic, which complete with the reprise of the first theme; the resultant sense of resolution allows the remaining sonata-form exigencies to be discarded. In the Ravel, the process is a macroharmonic one, wherein the first theme returns without the octatonicism that suffused the exposition. In the Milhaud, the primary theme is reprised without the bitonal clash that marked its initial appearance. In the Martinů, the process is an accumulative one, wherein signifiers of a jazz style are slowly introduced until they accrete into a concentrated evocation of jazz. This novel approach to sonata form spotlights the Parisian-modernist interest in “neoclassical” formal traditions and the ironic distance with which those traditions could be treated; it also forms an intriguing parallel with modernist notions of counterpoint between the arts in multimedia works, and enriches both theories of form and conceptions of the musical work as the intersection of independent compositional parameters.

Falling into Ruin: Neoclassical Sonata Form
In France, after the First World War, sonata-form structures of the 18th century were revived and reimagined within the context of neoclassicism. A new neoclassical sonata form was born: a structure designed to crumble and fail. This paper explores French sonata-form movements of the 1920s as structures of ruin—movements that not only pay homage to the sonata forms of the past, but also bear the scars left by the passage of time.
To demonstrate neoclassical French sonata form, I examine the large-scale form of the first movement of three representative neoclassical works: Milhaud’s Sonatine for Flute (1922), Poulenc’s Trio for Oboe, Bassoon and Piano (1926), and Ravel’s Sonata for Violin No. 2 (1923–27). My approach is based on Caplin’s form-functional theory (1998) but, because of the post-tonal nature of the pieces, I apply form-functional principles to melody in order to determine beginning, middle, and ending functions.
My analyses reveal that neoclassical sonata form is deformational (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006). “Failures” of formal structure are actually moments of expressive power. In these works, the clarity of formal functions, the boundaries of thematic areas, and the order of the thematic material disintegrates once a sonata-form structure has been suggested. By the onset of the recapitulation, each movement has already fallen into ruin: formal units are missing; themes are compressed; and new material outside of the sonata form appears. Ultimately, the beauty of neoclassical sonata form lies in its crumbling structure: a structure that simultaneously acknowledges the past and the present.

John Roeder (University of British Columbia)
World Music as a Resource for Teaching Music Theory
When learning outcomes are framed independently of a particular repertoire, music theory syllabi can comfortably accommodate musical diversity. Essays by Tenzer and Clendinning, responding to recent disciplinary deliberations, have suggested some ways to include “non-canonical” world music in the classroom, but more can be done. There are many good reasons to expose university students to diverse music, but it seems especially important for them to learn basic principles that many musics share.
In a first-year theory course I teach, we consider how pulse and meter, grouping structure and functions, pitch focus and hierarchy, and voice interactions in various textures can shape musical time. The syllabus provides a basis for analyzing “canonical” tonal and post-tonal repertoire covered in later courses, but it also supports close hearings of “non-canonical” music. Indeed, in the latter, fundamental rhythmic and melodic processes are often more salient than in art- or popular-music textures governed by harmonic and contrapuntal constraints.
In this talk I discuss how three examples of world music contribute to this pedagogical program: a layered Balinese gamelan cycle, a zither-flute duet from the Chinese silk-and-bamboo repertoire, and a melody played by a Bolivian panpipe orchestra. Although they originate in cultural contexts unfamiliar to most students, they are readily accessible. And they all employ the basic processes I cover in the course, often through strikingly similar procedures, such as interlocking patterns, melodic elaboration, motivic transformation, and collectional completion. Appreciating these shared procedures will help students understand the music(s) they eventually choose to concentrate on.

Including Music by Diverse Composers:
Redefining Modes of Analysis
There are many compelling reasons to be inclusive and to diversify the composers we study in classrooms. Significant efforts have been made in recent years by scholars to broaden the repertoire that we consider either as textbook music examples or as pieces for close analysis in scholarly works.  The broadening of the “canon” has been such a collective effort that we have begun to see the effects in textbooks, dissertation topics, conference papers and scholarly journals. As we continue the endeavor to diversify the composers we study by gender, sexuality, genre, nationality, culture, race, etc., this paper suggests that we can also consider this as an opportunity to achieve profound results from another angle. Theory and analysis as a field of study could be broadened by cultivating analytical approaches that are germane to the aesthetic and musical practices of works by diverse composers. This paper considers two such examples: how the notion of timbre and the notion of temporality could be complicated by analyzing music by Ruth Crawford and Tan Dun. It will be argued that incorporating works by diverse composers not only broadens the scope or diversifies the repertoire we study, it also opens up new theoretical inquiries and identifies and defines musical parameters in a fresh light—perspectives that are just as important but have heretofore received little attention in the general field of music theory. In other words, it helps us diversify and redefine what can be considered as valid and valuable modes of analysis.

Working with Diverse Student Populations in the Classroom
Music theory instructors may feel compelled to consider diversity in the classroom for personal reasons or because of departmental or institutional initiatives. They may also be motivated by broader educational trends both inside and outside music theory. For instance, the field of music theory continues to engage in discussions about curricular reform. Further, as public funding for elementary and high school music education is an ongoing struggle, incoming music majors may not have the skills once assumed to be basic. Finally, many universities in North America and Europe are recruiting increasing numbers of international students and improving access to education for equity-seeking groups. All of these trends may change the typical student abilities and worldviews that instructors encounter in their classrooms, necessitating an increased attention to diversity in music theory pedagogy.
This paper will define diversity broadly in order to propose a range of practical and concrete actions. A discussion of general principles of inclusivity, equity, diversity, and universal design for learning will lead to applications in a range of teaching situations where an attention to diversity can impact classroom teaching, including classroom dynamics, instructional strategies, course content, assessment, and course design. The paper will conclude with a list of practical strategies for instructors in diverse institutional contexts and career stages. Ultimately, this paper advocates for an increased sense of humanity in the classroom; that is, for instructors and students alike to see and celebrate the diversity of human beings learning alongside one another.

HISTORY OF THEORY AND
THE PRE-HISTORY OF MUSIC (HARRISON)

Heinrich Glarean, Jakob Paix, and the Problem of Polyphonic Mode
Theorizing mode in polyphony was a major concern for 16th-century theorists. These same questions have attracted significant attention from musicologists, especially following Harold Powers (1981, 1982, 1992). Gregory Barnett argues, “The modes are poor analytical tools, but they are rich in cultural significance. Each variant theory reflects a slightly different Renaissance-era world-view that is translated into musical terms” (Barnett 2013, 183). Jakob Paix puts forth a unique variant of modal theory. In 1589 the German organist Paix applied the 12-mode system from Heinrich Glarean’s <i>Dodecachordon</i> (1547) to a practical keyboard print, the <i>Thesaurus motetarum</i>. This keyboard intabulation of vocal works, purportedly in chronological order, gives each piece a single modal designation, often alongside direct quotation of Glarean’s modal descriptions. Paix’s modal labeling stands at some distance from Glarean’s and gives insight not only into Paix’s conception of mode but also hints toward a larger humanistic project that extends beyond the relatively modest claims that the print explicitly makes. I argue that this print positions Paix as not only an editor and composer but also as a learned theorist. Following Sarah Fuller (1996) and Cristle Collins Judd (2000) on Glarean’s ideological underpinnings, I argue that Paix tries to co-opt Glarean’s humanism, learning, and cultural capital and use it as his own. Though Paix’s display of erudition has more style than substance at points, his modal labels display a unique approach to the problem of mode in polyphony, one that is often flexible and intuitive yet sometimes convoluted and questionable.

Francescantonio Calegari and the Scuola dei rivolti:
A Bridge between the Prima and Seconda pratica?
The treatment of dissonance—the cornerstone of the distinction between the prima and seconda pratica—by common consent is considered to be regulated by the purely musical context in the former versus the priority given to expressive-rhetorical considerations in the latter style. The theories and compositions by Francescantonio Calegari (1656–1742) challenge this common belief: his treatise <i>Ampla dimostrazione degli armoniali musicali tuoni</i> (1732) and his arrangements of the music of Cinquecento masters shed light on his genuine views of the treatment of dissonance with its inversions (known as the scuola dei rivolti).
The Berlin Sing Akademie Archive contains the most representative collection of Calegari’s autograph arrangements of works by Palestrina, Asola, and other authors; it displays his keen interest in analyzing vertical sonorities and their succession in various modal contexts, with an emphasis on the correlation between the dissonances and emotionally laden words in the text.
The most obvious element Calegari drew from the study of Palestrina’s works was combining dissonances with their consonant resolutions, thus creating very particular sonorities. He stated: “Whoever wants to write in the modern harmonic style must understand the old style. The theories expressed here are founded in the practice of Palestrina. Through these, one can now utilize the principles of the old school with the new modern taste.”
Exploring Calegari’s theoretical premises vis-à-vis his analyses of old polyphonic works and his own surviving compositions calls into question our confidence in the unambiguous distinction between the place of dissonance in Prima versus Seconda pratica traditions.

Music and Language in Herbert Spencer's Evolutionary Thought
In this presentation I examine Victorian evolutionary theorist Herbert Spencer’s famous injunction, “All music is originally vocal.” In <i>The Origin and Function of Music</i> (1857), Spencer tracked a “progressive” line of ascent from simple vocal exclamations, to complex speech, and finally to music. Charles Darwin claimed oppositely that music evolved into language. Spencer’s vision of musical progress tracks with his conception of a dynamic capacity for emotional expression that is specific to the human species. The Spencerian idea that sonic expressivity evolved teleologically from simplicity to complexity, and from homogeneousness to heterogeneousness, reflects Spencer’s more general theory of evolutionary progress and anticipates modernist aesthetic ideologies.
My interest in Spencer’s music theory is less cosmological and more ethical. I probe what constitutes musical personhood for Spencer, as well as the kinds of sociocultural realities that can be formulated on the basis of theories like his. Voice is key here; for Spencer, voice is the fulcrum of language and music, exemplifying a broader physiological link between emotion and muscular movement. I highlight his sense that words evolved from vocal imitations of the phenomenal world, and I locate Spencer within a historical mimological tradition, alongside thinkers like Plato, Leibniz, John Locke, and Max Müller. “Mimologics” is Gérard Genette’s term for ideas about language that invoke a mimetic origin or function; I introduce Genette’s ideas for a music theory audience. Finally, I bring Spencer’s conception of an unmediated link between voice and emotional expression into contact with contemporary evolutionary musicology in order to assess the mimologics latent within present-day evolutionary music theories.


CROSS-MODAL PERCEPTION IN MULTIMEDIA
AND VIRTUAL REALITY (MCKINLEY)

A Neurocognitive Approach to Modeling Cross-Sensory
Perception in Music and Multimedia
<i>Crossmodal associations</i> are nonarbitrary relationships that the brain draws between features or dimensions of different sensory modes. Examples include audio-visual associations such as loudness-brightness and pitch-height. The brain also recognizes <i>intramodal associations</i> between features of the same sensory mode, such as pitch-tempo and brightness-angularity. Modal associations have become an important topic in cognitive neuroscience and psychology because of the significant influence they have on perception and the broad implications for this research outside of those fields. In music, these associations offer a means for describing analytical relationships between both musical and multimedia parameters. However, because of the specific nature of these studies, which often focus on only one parameter in a single context, it is difficult even for interdisciplinary researchers familiar with this work to navigate and apply modal associations in a broader way to analysis.
This paper synthesizes relevant research from the cognitive literature and presents a tool for modeling multiple crossmodal and intramodal relationships within a single metric space. I begin by presenting an interactive online resource created for analysts to reference modal associations by parameter and find other known relationships. Based on shared features and transitive and reciprocal relationships, I argue that these associations can be broadly sorted into three categories or dimensions, and modeled using an analytical tool I’ve created called the Crossmodal and Intramodal Association (CIA) Model. I close by discussing some of the implications of congruent and incongruent associations and potential applications to analysis, composition, and performance.
These affordances suggest further connections with phenomenological and cognitive theories of multistability (Idhe 2012, Karpinski 2012). By examining relationships between melodies in terms of these multistable possibilities, I offer a more sensitive account of the contour relations listeners may perceive within the music, providing a better understanding of Reich’s minimalist process.

The Analytical Lightshow: Concert Lighting as Analysis in
Extreme Metal Live Performance
Lightshows at contemporary rock concerts generally create an immersive, multi-sensory experience. Their most sophisticated variants, however, provide a visual analysis of the music as it unfolds. This paper presents a case study of the analytical lightshow, by examining how the intricate lightshows of extreme metal band Meshuggah contribute an interpretive layer that not only promotes multi-sensory engagement, but also actively guides listeners through songs’ formal structures.
Theorists (Pieslak 2007; Capuzzo 2018; Lucas 2018) have analyzed Meshuggah’s idiosyncratic approach to rhythmic complexity. By reading Meshuggah’s lightshows as immanent visual analysis, this paper bears out Lochhead’s exploration of “sonic meaning as informed by sight” (2006, 67), and shows how lighting design can mediate between musical complexity and listeners’ engagement.
Meshuggah’s lightshows are exhaustively synchronized to the rhythmic patterns of the guitars and drums; meticulous use of color, brightness, directionality, placement pattern, and beam movement provide additional information about gesture, articulation, and pitch. My analyses, supported by lighting designer Edvard Hansson’s digital models of the lightshow and by video playback, align salient features of the lightshows with transcriptions, showing both how closely their rhythmic contents align, and how riff attributes are enhanced by lighting.
Meshuggah’s analytical lightshows provide a three-dimensional visual score that dramatizes rhythms while guiding listeners through each riff. By presenting analysis and performance simultaneously and as each other, Meshuggah combines technical virtuosity with rock authenticity, and provides another example of what Lucas (2014) calls “coercive synesthesia,” as the lighting becomes an inextricable part of the musical experience.

Like "Daft Punk on bloody C R A C K":
Constructing the Identity of the Virtual Reality DJ
In many virtual reality (VR) experiences, the identity inhabited by the user is at least as if not more important than the gameplay itself. For example, the VR game <i>Electronauts</i> (Survios 2018) invites its user to take on the persona of a futuristic space-DJ. However, a cursory foray into the game quickly reveals its myriad constraints, which exercise a significant influence over what music a user can create. And yet player reviews seem to suggest a lack of awareness regarding these limits. Indeed, users take full ownership over the music created using <i>Electronauts</i>, claiming the game makes them feel like “a real DJ.”<i> Electronauts</i> facilitates this identification with the DJ persona by building DJ aesthetic practices (largely theorized by Mark Butler (2014) and Yara Sellin (2005)) into the interface itself.
I argue that VR technology opens up new avenues of user engagement by providing a hyper-immersive experience of identification, moving beyond virtual performance to the construction of a virtual creative identity. Rather than the music working to support a visual medium, as is common in film or video games, <i>Electronauts</i> exhibits how music can in a sense be the medium, facilitating the embodied experience of identification. By providing the experience of truly “feeling like a DJ,” <i>Electronauts</i> invites its users to take ownership of the music created within the game—as one user states: “if you like music, and REALLY wanna feel like a DJ or Daft Punk on bloody C R A C K download this.”


FORMS, FRAGMENTS, AND DEFORMATION (TAFT A)

Strategic Incompletion in Clara Schumann's Lieder
The abstract notion of “completion” is a central concern for many approaches to music analysis. We regularly speak of the completion of formal sections, the completion of motivic processes, the completion of narrative journeys, aggregate completion, and so on. Accordingly, the strategic use of musical incompletion, and purposeful avoidance of the completion of a fundamental musical idea, would be a marked musical event, one that could effectively portray similarly marked aspects of a given poetic text. In this paper I examine two songs by Clara Schumann (1819–96) that explore the notion of strategic incompletion of the fundamental structure in two interesting ways: (1) delaying the first appearance of the tonic harmony until nearly the end of the song through an expanded auxiliary cadence, and (2) establishing the tonic harmony early on as expected but concluding the song on the structural dominant, resulting in a “permanent interruption” (see Latham 2008).
By purposefully suppressing aspects of the fundamental structure through the devices mentioned here, music can become charged with dramatic tension and rich with expressive potential. These two techniques represent opposite ends of a spectrum, one concerned with incompletion directed at the beginning of the fundamental structure, the other with incompletion directed at its conclusion. More generally, composers may draw upon the abstract notion of strategic incompletion to depict any number of musico-poetic sentiments in a song.

Fragments and Frames in the Early Romantic Era
Goehr (2015) contends that the work-concept wholly transformed the prelude, so that “the practice of preparatory preluding became the art of a Romantic prelude already prepared” (8). By definition, the prelude is both incomplete and merely functional, used by performers to ready themselves for the main event. But, Goehr argues, this utilitarian status was tenuous from the very outset, for the moment the prelude was too interesting, it threatened to upstage the main event and shed its preparatory identity (10). How does this paradox relate to the introduction, another kind of “preparatory” music? In other words, how do introductions deny their inherently marginal quality? I respond to this question by comparing three compositions: Felix Mendelssohn’s String Quartet in A Minor, op. 13 (1827) and the opening movements of Robert Schumann’s Piano Sonata in F-sharp Minor, op. 11 (1835) and Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel’s String Quartet in E-flat (1834). My analytical framework focuses on three intersecting levels: the individual work’s formal attributes, intertextual relationships, and the aesthetic trends that inform a variety of beginning strategies. I draw on Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) and Caplin’s (1998) theories of classical form augmented by important perspectives on early 19th-century form (Daverio 1993; Schmalfeldt 2011; and Vande Moortele 2017). Analytical comparison of these opening procedures shows the relevance of the Romantic <i>tendenz</i> toward fragment in these increasingly independent introductions.

Tracing the Second Theme Narrative in
Fanny Hensel's Piano Trio in D Minor
The 19th century was a time for formal innovation. As recent scholarship contends, what once would have been deformational quickly became normative, pushing composers to experiment further. Though the bulk of Hensel’s compositions are songs and short piano pieces, her few larger works demonstrate progressive techniques that align with current explorations of Romantic-era form studies. In this presentation, I look at how the open-ended secondary theme in the first movement of Hensel’s Piano Trio affects significant structural moments and how this impacts the traditional sonata narrative. In effect, I show how this theme, along with its cyclic return in the finale, culminates to provide both thematic and structural closure in the Piano Trio’s deployment of sonata form.
The first movement departs from the second theme, unresolved by moving immediately to contrasting material in the parallel minor, leaving the EEC and ESC to be achieved by a third theme. The finale’s secondary theme likewise struggles to find resolution, recalling the primary theme to achieve the EEC. We hear familiar material prior to the recapitulation’s structural close: the unresolved secondary theme from the first movement. The restatement of this material at the conclusion of the fourth movement highlights a cyclic return, and establishes a contrasting narrative to Hensel’s other sonata movements.
Further analysis on Hensel’s works may explore other hallmarks of early 19th-century formal construction, providing both a path for future examination of idiosyncratic formal constructs and an expansion of current discussion of Fanny Hensel’s catalogue.

Anti-Telos Choruses in Recent Pop
Reports of the chorus’s death have been increasing in pop-critical circles. Indeed, after decades of “don’t bore us, get to the chorus,” many recent pop songs place their focus away from their choruses, subverting normative formal models and opening up space for teleological climax to occur elsewhere. One particular subversive technique pervades post-2010 pop music: after a textural buildup in a verse and prechorus, the chorus begins with a sudden and extreme drop in energy, negating any release of tension and making the chorus the song’s point of lowest energy. In this paper, I investigate the hermeneutics of these "anti-telos choruses," drawing analytical examples from Top-40 hits of the current decade.
Anti-telos choruses in general serve two expressive purposes. First, they engender a sense of intimacy between song persona and listener. Drawing on Allan Moore’s concept of proxemics (2012) and Asaf Peres’s "sonic functions" (2016), I demonstrate that anti-telos choruses employ sonic techniques associated with closeness, such as removing reverb from the vocal line, omitting any accompaniment in the voice’s pitch range, and using a soft and quiet singing style. Second, anti-telos choruses open up space for other sections to act as a song’s energetic peak, thus threatening the chorus’s status as a climactic focal point. My discussion ultimately demonstrates how form is not just a basic template for song design but an inherently expressive feature of pop songs.

"...a jolly good time": Understanding Groove in Progressive Rock
Progressive rock is characterized by scholars and music critics as a genre that emphasizes the mind over the body, such that it is “not about music for dancing” (Macan 1997), but rather designed for careful listening. When groove-based sections do occur, they often feature complex rhythms or meters that “[lessen] the music’s bodily appeal, calling for thought about rhythm rather than immediate participation in it” (Stone 2016). Other scholars, however, have argued that prog fans do engage with this music bodily, suggesting that the phenomenon of groove in prog deserves further exploration.
While previous scholarship on metrically complex grooves has discussed their structural features or their signification of artistic seriousness, I focus on how musical elements model the process by which listeners might learn how to entrain to these grooves. Prog songs frequently feature teleological processes in which “difficult” grooves are repeated until they become contextually stable in a sequence that may span multiple formal units. Similarly, textural modifications likewise counterbalance rhythmic and metric complexity, creating a narrative arc that rewards the learning of complex temporal patterns. Through several analytical vignettes, I demonstrate how the “groove-learning process” enacted in these songs interacts with text and formal structure. Thus, these grooves provide insight into how “music for listening” may be rendered danceable.

Extended Final Phrases in Popular Songs
As analysts and listeners, we place special importance on closure at the ends of tonal works. There are many theoretical and analytical considerations of this issue in art music, but few in popular music, and most of those focus on harmonic structures. The roles of phrase rhythm and hypermeter in creating closure in popular songs has been little explored. This paper examines a closing technique discussed by Kirnberger and other 18th-century theorists that persists in 20th-century popular songs, whereby the last statement of a regular four-bar phrase is extended by one or more bars. In modern terms, this extension often shifts the final bar of the phrase from a hypermetrically weak position to a strong one, increasing the sense of closure. This technique helps to differentiate the final section (which is often a chorus) from its earlier iterations, and resembles the end-accented “closing-theme schema” discussed by Temperley and Ng. Final phrases can be extended and end-weighted through three basic techniques, which may be used alone or in combination: composed-out decelerations, extensions of the cadential progression, and internal repetitions. The high degree of repetition, short length of repeated units, and prevalence of open-ended formal sections in popular songs render the issue of closure more problematic than in art music. This paper demonstrates that 20th-century popular songwriters sometimes adopted a much older strategy for achieving conclusive endings, and suggests that phrase structure and hypermeter in popular songs are less regular than has been generally assumed.


RECONTEXTUALIZING METER (MCKINLEY)
Roger Matthew Grant (Wesleyan University), Chair

Richard Cohn (Yale University)
Damaged Cargo: Concerning the Unfortunate Voyage of Classical Poetic Theory to the Land of the Modern Music-Theory Textbook
Music theory textbooks share a consensus definition of meter, which is directly appropriated from the late 18th century. I identify several problems with the definition, from the standpoint of modern metric research. I propose that the problems result from a three-stage process of transmission, whose origin is the ancient Greek theory of poetic verse feet, and whose intermediate stages are 18th-century theory of poetic prosody, and 18th-century theory of (mostly) vocal music. At each stage, the source has considerable prestige within the culture of the target domain. This encourages an uncritical adoption ("shoehorning") of features that fit poorly with the repertories being modelled. I propose a repertory-general definition of musical meter, based on modern research, that avoids all of the identified problems, but requires some minor terminological retooling.

On Metrical Structure and Cueing Systems in Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues"
Bill Monroe's "Muleskinner Blues" is a signature item in the bluegrass canon. Indeed, Monroe himself claims to have discovered the essence of bluegrass rhythm in this old Jimmie Rodgers tune. And yet, the song stands in sharp contrast to the metrical and hypermetrical norms that shaped bluegrass music as it developed in the 1950s and ’60s, eschewing regular four-bar hypermeter in favor of a highly irregular phrase structure with seemingly indeterminate downbeats. This paper offers an analysis of Monroe’s “Muleskinner Blues” conducted with an eye toward its fluid approach to meter. I show how the song’s metrical structure, embodied in the group actions of the Blue Grass Boys, responds flexibly to Bill Monroe’s extended vocal expressions. In so doing, my analysis highlights the musical events that forecast impending harmonic changes, providing key insight into the “cueing systems” (Gupta 2017) that hold together such improvisatory musical spaces. The paper thus supplements existing studies on style-wide systems of licks and progression schemes (Adler 1974; Stoia 2013) required for successful bluegrass picking, arguing that a Blue Grass Boy would additionally require song-specific schemas to facilitate quick musical responses in a constrained yet flexible musical environment.

Many Malinke Meters: Analytical Applications of Meter
Theory to Dance Drumming of Guinea
According to Justin London’s <i>many meters hypothesis</i>, meters are “highly context-specific patterns of temporal expectation that govern our attention to, as well as performance of, rhythmic sequences” (London 2012, 8), where each meter is “a coordinated set of periodic temporal cycles of sensorimotor attention” (91). By aligning London’s concept of temporal cycles with Gerhard Kubik’s four African “basic, cross-culturally valid reference levels with regard to timing: … elementary pulsation[s], … reference beat[s], … cycle[s]” (Kubik 2010, 31), and “time-line patterns” (57), this paper seeks to establish an analytical procedure to quantify the many meters used in Guinean Malinke dance drumming.
Guinean Malinke dance drumming is performed by an eight-to-ten-part polyrhythmic percussion ensemble. The music is constructed of cycles of multiple repeating patterns of varying lengths. While many accompaniments are multi-use, each piece utilizes an identity pattern in the form of an eight- to sixteen-beat melo-rhythmic conversation between two of the drums. This paper analyzes a corpus of 76 pieces as taught and published by former national ballet drummers to establish the many meters at work in Malinke dance drumming. I then demonstrate the ways in which the identity pattern and accompaniments of each piece may be expressed as contours of varying strength and weakness relative to its multiple specific, both isochronous and non-isochronous (timeline), metric layers. A quantification of these overlapping shapes allows a view of the depth and complexity of this music.

An Investigation of Metrical Dissonance in Tap Dance Improvisation
A “cutting contest” is a public challenge between two skilled tap dancers, who alternate increasingly elaborate rhythmic sequences, beginning with eight bars per sequence, ultimately reducing to a single bar. Dancers must enter on time (pick-ups and syncopated entrances are permitted), lest they forfeit the contest. At the start of the contest, the tap dancers and judges negotiate the meter and tempo of the contest. The judge gives a count-off bar and the first dancer begins as the only “musical source.” The original meter is maintained by the judge through the tapping of his/her feet, although rendered inaudible by the audience’s verbal reactions to the dancer’s steps. The opponent keeps his eyes locked on the soloist as he silently counts. Since tap dancers create the audible rhythmic patterns, while the meter is “unheard,” dancers use metric dissonance (Krebs 1999; Love 2013) in hopes of metrically misleading one’s opponent.
In this paper, I aim to demonstrate that tap dancers use metrical dissonance as means of confusing their opponents. I will examine solos by Joshua Johnson, Jumaane Taylor, and Sarah Reich. Since the primary goal of the opponent is to be able to identify the meter at all times, tap soloists strategize their own unpitched tap shoes to accent metrical dissonances that cloud the original meter.

Middleground Prototypes for Mozart's
First-Movement Concerto Forms
Tonal theorists have neglected the concerto compared to most other formal genres. In this paper, I present exposition prototypes for Mozart’s major-mode concerto forms, analyzing the opening movements of K. 488 and K. 447 as examples. In doing so, I also suggest a solution to potential Kopfton contradictions arising from the “double-expositional” structure typical of concerto first movements.
I propose a set of eight middleground exposition prototypes for Hepokoski and Darcy’s (2006) Type 5 sonata. These prototypes account for each combination of third- and fifth-progressions for P and one or two S themes. Since the opening ritornello (doubling as a first “exposition”) typically does not modulate, and since the recapitulation synthesizes material in the two expositions, Type 5 sonatas are replete with sites of potential conflict between third- and fifth-progressions. Some permutations do not cause any inherent problems, as demonstrated in an analysis of K. 488.
However, the challenge of Kopfton contradiction arises in the combination of descending from 3^   in P and from 5^   in S. Rather than dismissing this possibility, I suggest a middleground “hybrid descent” (5 ^  –4    ^  –3^  —3^  –2^  –1^  ) that can be interpreted from either Kopfton according to context, using K. 447 as an example. The hybrid allows for a nuanced interpretation of concerto movements with dialogue between  3^   and 5^  , providing a solution to one of many analytical challenges posed by the classical concerto and spearheading a new branch of scholarship on tonal analysis of concerto forms.

The Hymn as a Musical Topic in Haydn's Symphonies:
Stylistic Sources and Expressive Trajectories
Scholars regularly describe the opening themes from the slow movements of Haydn’s Symphonies Nos. 75, 87, 88, and 98 as “hymn-like,” even crediting Haydn as the creator of this theme-type (Rosen 1971). Despite frequent observations on the similarities between themes, little attention has been paid to the comparative study of these entire movements. This paper focuses on this set of symphonic hymns as a case study to address two issues central to the theory of musical topics: first, the necessity (and difficulty) of properly grounding topics in the musical landscape of their time, and second, how the interaction of topics with one another and with other elements of musical structure can generate diverse expressive trajectories.
I demonstrate that these themes resemble, rather than church music, the musical style of opera scenes depicting ritual actions performed by female or supernatural cohorts. More precisely, the Largo from Symphony No. 88 features remarkable similarities with Gluck’s <i>Orphée et Eurydice</i> and the Adagio of Symphony No. 98 presents close parallelisms with Haydn’s own rendition of the Orphic myth. In each of the symphonies mentioned above, Haydn revisits the same theme-type but adapts it every time to an entirely different formal design (theme and variations, monothematic and bi-thematic sonata form, and sonata-rondo), highlighting diverse meanings generated by the hymn topic through expressive oppositions. Because these movements feature remarkably similar themes but maximally divergent formal layouts, analyzing them as a group illustrates Haydn’s oft-invoked authorial voice and the productive interplay between topics and compositional strategies.




CORRALLING THE CHORALE: MOVING AWAY FROM SATB WRITING IN THE UNDERGRADUATE MUSIC THEORY
CURRICULUM (TAFT C)
<i>Presentations, Lightning Talks, and Panel Discussion
</i>William van Geest (University of Michigan), Chair
Jennifer Snodgrass (Appalachian State University), Respondent
Four-part chorale-style writing is so central to music theory pedagogy that it is difficult to imagine a curriculum without it. Yet, as much as we rely on chorales to teach general principles of music, they are specific in structure and their origins lie in a specifically German theological tradition. This raises a number of questions: are chorales effective for the purposes to which we put them? What pedagogical possibilities do they obscure? What can our reliance on this genre tell us about North American music theory and the commitments or anxieties it carries? Overall: are we right to depend on SATB writing as we do? In this panel, we seek to engage with these questions by examining the role of the chorale in the undergraduate theory curriculum and proposing pedagogical approaches that delay, reconfigure, or replace it.
This panel consists of six papers. The first, a 20-minute paper, will examine the chorale in contemporary music theory textbooks as a means of establishing a baseline for current pedagogical practices. Following this paper, five lightning talks will address curricular implications and pressures as well as proposals to shift the chorale’s traditional applications. Panelists draw largely on first-hand experience from various institutional settings, including a liberal-arts college, a state school, a research university, a conservatory, and a school of music. Finally, Professor Jennifer Snodgrass will offer a response, after which those in attendance are invited to contribute to the discussion.

The Chorale in American Music Theory:
A Corpus Study of Leading Textbooks
While music theorists widely acknowledge the chorale’s privileged position in American music theory, very little scholarship critically examines this position. In this paper, I address this omission by presenting a corpus study of leading undergraduate textbooks. I aim through this study not only to establish the prevalence of chorales in undergraduate music theory instruction, but, more importantly, to reveal some particularities of their usage and the commitments this usage encodes.
I begin by investigating chorales’ prevalence. I examine their incidence among musical examples, authors’ purposes in using them, and their distribution relative to particular topics. I also explore authors’ handling of chorales. I demonstrate their preference for four-part, vocal, homophonic chorale-harmonizations by J. S. Bach; but I also discuss their presentation, both visually and aurally, as a texture rather than as a genre, and one abstracted from cultural context and instrumentation. Through an examination of authors’ explicit definitions of the terms “chorale” and “chorale style,” I show the chorale’s close connection to a widely held model of musical structure. Indeed, to all appearances, the chorale in American music theorists’ preferred form is virtually indistinguishable from this model of musical structure. Finally, I discuss authors’ justifications for employing chorales and “chorale style”: their various appeals—to biology, musical norms, and musical ontologies, among others—and attempts to normativize chorale-related practices.
Through this corpus study, I then show that the chorale lies deeply entrenched in American music theory and is closely connected to the field’s basic practices and theoretical commitments.

Resolving Chords to Resolve Anxieties:
Pressures around Teaching the Chorale
Theory curricula are shaped not only by the perceived needs of our students, but also by pressures—both real and imagined—to produce students that exhibit competency in the rules of voice-leading, phrase structure, and other concepts that are traditionally taught in conservatories and schools of music. Central to these competencies is the mastery of chorale-style writing and its attendant voice-leading rules. In this brief talk, I address the pressures, labor costs, and anxieties that constrain attempts to decentralize chorale-style writing in the undergraduate curriculum.
Internally, one must fit within a cohesive departmental curriculum. More broadly, textbook norms and common curricular practices across schools provide self-reinforcing standards for what music is and how musicians should understand it—a lingua franca of musicianship, one which currently includes skills in SATB part-writing. Moreover, any curricular changes de-emphasizing SATB materials also impose hidden labor costs on instructors. To move away from textbook norms, faculty must construct new materials and reconfigure existing ones, a significant task that reduces time for other activities that are necessary to one’s job. Such changes also compel theory instructors to reconsider their skills as pedagogues: a shift away from chorales likely involves moving away from their own undergraduate training, and thus acquiring new skills.
As we consider decentralizing SATB activities, we must take into account that instructors deploying changes bear costs and face anxieties and pressures from ourselves, our departments, and our peer institutions.

Administering Pedagogy: Navigating the Institutional Impacts of a Changing Theory Curriculum
Implementing a new music theory curriculum involves more than the details of course design. Curricular changes may impact multiple faculty members and areas of study across a department, conservatory, or school of music, whether the program is highly integrated or isolated. Proposing such changes must involve careful consideration of both the process and impact beyond the theory classroom. In this paper, I draw on my experience as a music theory instructor, course coordinator, and theory area administrator to highlight common challenges of implementing a new theory curriculum. Specifically, I use the decentralization of chorale-style components in a music theory curriculum as a case-study.
Drawing on interviews and surveys of administrators, students, and music theory instructors across multiple institutions, I employ two primary perspectives throughout the paper. The first is as a music theory instructor addressing administrators and colleagues regarding potential impacts on courses both inside and outside the theory curriculum, while the second is as an administrator addressing potential impacts on the department or institution. Each perspective offers positive or negative valences on specific aspects and dimensions of the curriculum change. Throughout the paper I examine intersections of both perspectives as measured valuations on five aspects of a chorale-deemphasized curricular change: (1) textbook and course materials; (2) impacts on non-music-theory colleagues and their courses; (3) student reactions; (4) strategies for dealing with resistance to changes; and (5) outlooks on institutional recruitment, retention, and future placement of students.

Repurposing the Chorale in the Theory Classroom
Theorists often endeavor to show the chorale’s relevance to Western classical music, but typically stop short of demonstrating how four-part writing applies to students’ other musical activities. Given the substantial costs associated with four-part writing, it can be a risky investment. Failure to connect the topic with non-classroom-based musical practice jeopardizes losing the return, leaving students disenchanted and discouraged. In this paper, I show how chorale-style writing and analysis can be reimagined in a liberal arts program in order to relate to a wider array of musical interests. My aim here is not to minimize or abandon the utility of the chorale, but rather to repurpose four-part writing for application in non-classical styles.
Through early exploration of rules and departures, I lay groundwork for the flexibility that may be asked of students in other theory classrooms, performing ensembles, composition, and other creative practice. By the time I introduce four-part writing, we have already seen that some of the most compelling parts of music come when rules are eschewed or worked around, which is particularly relevant to Bach chorales. We discuss how different rules apply in different contexts—for students looking to improve their performance in an ensemble, arranging for an a capella group, or music-directing a staged show, I find conversations such as these help them direct their theory work into musical practice. My experience has shown that chorale-later architectures invite students from diverse backgrounds to engage analytically without being hindered by the steep learning curve of chorale-based practices.

Teaching Undergraduate Voice-Leading with
Neo-Riemannian Techniques
While the term "voice-leading" in undergraduate music theory courses often refers to chorale harmonization or species counterpoint, Neo-Riemannian theory offers another way of engaging deeply with the succession of harmonies and the movement of individual voices. This paper advocates for including Neo-Riemannian theory in core undergraduate theory courses, and outlines a modular sample curriculum. A unit on Neo-Riemannian theory can be invigorating for students, as it offers them new ways of thinking about chromatic music, and of re-interpreting other frequently taught topics such as modal mixture. And as a capstone to the "tonal" portion of the undergraduate curriculum, Neo-Riemannian theory can serve as a gentle introduction to many of the concepts introduced in the "20th-century” course that often ends the sequence. Simple and direct examples serve as a jumping-off point: students can sing or notate straightforward transformations. Later in the unit, consideration of the many geometric models of tonal space prepares students to deal with the abstractions and operations of pitch-class set theory, or to navigate the difficulties of dealing in abstractions away from the musical surface. Such examples also lend themselves to compelling visual analyses, which students can use as they listen to music, and which they often enjoy producing themselves. Finally, Neo-Riemannian theory offers the opportunity to incorporate new repertoires into the undergraduate core curriculum: not only the highly chromatic 19th-century music originally addressed by the theory, but also popular music, film music, jazz, and other styles.

Building an Undergraduate Curriculum without SATB Writing
This paper presents possibilities for those who wish to decentralize chorale writing in particular, and perhaps classical music in general, in their own curricula. I report from my own experiences of constructing and directing a four-semester curriculum that gives only glancing attention to chorale writing and its voice leading rules. Decentralizing chorales in the theory classroom is not without its challenges; these include a dearth of pedagogical support from textbooks and lack of a unified pedagogical framework. I show how I am able to respond to these challenges by developing an eclectic, modular curriculum that seeks to be responsive to the interests and needs of my students.
In my curriculum, Theory I acts as a gateway course while the other three courses may be taken in any order and rotated out of the sequence according to instructor and student interest (the other three classes are currently rhythm, counterpoint, and contemporary styles). Rotating out classes allows the instructor to respond to the always-changing musical lives of students at a given institution and impart skills applicable across a wide variety of musical activities, from church arrangements to beat-making, popular songwriting, and/or classical music performance and composition. I argue that a non-sequential and eclectic approach can constitute a first step toward deconstructing the problematic yet pervasive teleology of style that informs mainstream music theory pedagogy at present. It is one way to keep apace of our rapidly shifting world, and to stay relevant to our students’ increasingly diverse musical experiences.

The Puzzle of Style: On Leonard Meyer's Unlikely Replications
Strangely enough, the concept of style has rarely received sustained attention from music theorists. While many particular styles have been studied at length, the only major inquiry into the concept itself in recent decades is Leonard Meyer’s <i>Style and Music</i> of 1989. Meyer’s account, describing style as replicated patterning resulting from choices made within some set of constraints, has continued to be cited but has not been further elaborated or challenged in any systematic way. Given the wide range of intellectual developments both contemporary with <i>Style and Music</i> (especially in other disciplines, which Meyer cites widely but not systematically) and more recent (including a variety of “turns” in music scholarship), it is high time to revisit the concept.
This paper begins that inquiry by considering a class of thought experiments that might be called “style puzzles,” in which some paradoxical or impossible imagined work is probed for insights about style, replication, or related concepts. Meyer himself discusses one famous example, Borges’s “Pierre Menard, Author of the <i>Quixote</i>”—but Meyer’s reading fails to fully grasp the stylistic implications of the story’s central paradox, and thus points symptomatically to a gap in his theory. I situate Meyer alongside readings of this and other style puzzles from art historians, including Arthur Danto and Whitney Davis, whose investigations spur cross-disciplinary difficulties alongside insights into important questions: How are replication and choice manifested and recognized in/as musical style? More broadly, what can and should the notion of style do for the study of music?

The Bias of Western Musical Notation in Music Copyright Litigation
In music copyright law, it has been asserted that music is a quantifiable object and that music analysis is an objective act. However, because musical arguments lack falsifiability, music analysis is instead a subjective, interpretive act. Inherent in interpretive analytical decisions are value judgments about what is worth analyzing and what methods should be used. Because our analysis techniques are rooted in Western art music, these decisions often prioritize melody and harmony. Consequently, these musical features are prioritized by American copyright law. While melody and harmony are considered valuable musical features worthy of copyright protection, musical features that are important to other musical traditions are devalued.
This paper investigates the ways that different musical features are valued or devalued in music copyright law by suggesting that the continued use of Western musical notation in the courtroom has played a substantial role in perpetuating the prioritization of so-called “primary” musical features and the devaluing of “secondary” ones. In addition to prioritizing certain musical features over others, staff notation can alienate or sway the jury of “lay listeners” often required in music copyright cases.
The decisions made in music copyright cases contribute to the power dynamics at play in the music industry: deciding who can create what, how something can be created, and who deserves credit for the creation. Since music copyright cases can have a tangible effect on the creation of popular music, it is crucial that we as music scholars interrogate and address the biases inherent in music copyright law.

Deposit Copy or Recording? Sources for Musical-Legal Analysis in Current Federal Copyright Litigation
Musical similarity in federal copyright lawsuits is analyzed first by expert witnesses, followed by non-expert factfinders, either judges or jurors. Although the legal scope of their assessments is different, both groups must compare tangible copies of the songs at issue: either sheet music filed with the U.S. Copyright Office as a deposit copy; or recordings and transcriptions of them, produced by experts for the purpose of litigation. For music copyrighted prior to the enactment of the 1976 Copyright Act, sheet music served as the primary representation of a song as intellectual property. Although written notation ostensibly promises legal documentation, for music created first on record, deposit copies are often de facto lead sheets that merely outline more complex compositions. If these songs are later implicated in copyright lawsuits, what source should serve as the point of musical-legal comparison: the deposit copy or the recording?
This question has emerged in three current federal copyright lawsuits: Williams v. Bridgeport Music, over the songs “Blurred Lines” and “Got To Give It Up”; Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin, over the songs “Taurus” and “Stairway to Heaven”; and Griffin v. Sheeran, over the songs “Let’s Get It On” and “Thinking Out Loud.” After a gloss of legislative discrepancies between the 1909 and 1976 Copyright Acts and relevant judicial decision-making processes, this presentation examines court records and compares examples from these cases to model the ontological problematics of musical-legal analysis. In so doing, it highlights the critical, and public, role of musical analysis in federal copyright law.

Rotational Form as a 'Becoming' Process:  An Analysis of the
"Annunciation of Death" Scene in Wagner's <i>Die Walküre</i>
The “Annunciation of Death,” a duet in Act 2, scene 4 of Wagner’s <i>Die Walküre</i>, is a dramatic turning point in the Ring Cycle. The warrior goddess Brünnhilde appears to the mortal Siegmund to deliver the chief god’s decree that he shall die in an upcoming battle; however, as Siegmund appeals for mercy for the sake of his sister-lover Sieglinde, Brünnhilde’s resolve weakens, and she decides to defy her orders and save him. Moreover, the sympathy and love she learns through their encounter ultimately motivates Brünnhilde to commit the sacrifice that redeems the world at the end of the Ring Cycle.
The dramatic importance of this scene has attracted much attention from scholars; significant studies include analyses by Alfred Lorenz (1924), Robert Bailey (1977), Eero Tarasti (2012), and Karol Berger (2016). My paper revolves around the changing dramatic relationship between Brünnhilde and Siegmund over the course of the scene, and its reflection in the musical architecture.
In my reading, the dramatic narrative is realized in rotational form, with each rotation led by “Siegmund’s Death Song”—a motive usually associated with Siegmund’s downfall. However, instead of treating the motive as a fixed signifier for Siegmund, I explore how the realization of the motive and the resulting progressive momentum in the playing-out of the rotational form reveal a shift between which character exercises control over the narrative. By tracing this narrative dynamic, the rotational form of the duet can be appraised not as a rigid organizational constraint, but as a drama-generating process.

Dissonance and Political Violence in Two Sappho Operas
Like most 18th-century operatic renditions of the tale, the dramatic climax of Antoine Reicha’s <i>Sapho </i>(1822) occurs when the title character sacrifices herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs. Reicha’s musical setting of the scene is extraordinary by the standards of early 19th-century opera, as it harmonizes a descending chromatic scale with sequential diminished seventh and second-inversion dominant seventh chords. Evidence suggests that this moment may have caught the attention of government censors, and Reicha opined over the musical changes forced upon the opera, particularly by the administrators of the Académie royale de musique, in his unpublished autobiography.
Reicha’s opera might have been considered suspicious because of its relationship to another Sappho opera by Jean-Paul-Égide Martini that premiered in France in 1794. Martini’s opera is relatively unknown today, but several critics made connections between the two versions. Martini’s <i>Sapho</i> was among the most popular newly-composed works in Paris during the Thermidorian Reaction: its most striking feature is undoubtedly the 12-note chord found in the overture, recast as a 10-note harmony at the moment of sacrifice.
David Charlton suggests that the libretto of Martini’s version (written by Constance de Salm) may contain hidden criticisms of policies championed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror. My paper will solidify Charlton’s hypothesis by analyzing how Martini’s hyperdissonant chord functions as a signifier of Revolutionary failure, through examining relationships between the use of dissonance and Revolutionary iconography in the opera, allowing the sheer act of dissonance to be inextricably linked to narrative invocations of authoritarian violence.

Transacting Musical Time: Where Rhythm Ends and Rubato Begins
Most studies of expressive timing in classical music analyze performances in conjunction with scores. But many listeners do not access scores. They work from sound alone to ascertain rhythm and rubato simultaneously. Conflict arises between with-score and without-score perspectives whenever rubato is extreme enough that a listener perceives a different rhythm from what is notated. In this paper, I examine instances of this conflict in the verismo opera tradition and the challenges they pose for theories of rhythm perception.
I first propose five ontological levels at which rhythm manifests: ideal (prototypical norms), notated (what is written), performed (what is notated plus the performer’s rubato), sounding (durations without rhythmic interpretation), and perceived (what is understood by a listener). I then provide multi-level analyses of passages from <i>Cavalleria rusticana</i>, <i>Pagliacci</i>, and <i>Tosca</i>. I suggest that in each case, the perceived rhythm is different from the notated rhythm at even the level of meter and/or hypermeter. I then ask: what might it feel like to be the performer here, what might it feel like to be the scoreless listener, and why might this performing tradition have been established in the first place?
I conclude by exploring the implications of these examples for rhythm theory as a whole. The hard distinction between rhythm and rubato is undermined when tempo manipulation is aurally indistinguishable from metric manipulation. Instead of defining “expressive timing” as deviation from written note values, I suggest that timing is made expressive by the ascription of agency.

Partial Orders of Modal Brightness
This paper generalizes a familiar fact about the seven diatonic modes: they can be ranked unambiguously in terms of pitch height relative to a fixed tonic. For instance, every pitch of C locrian is lower than or equal to the corresponding scale degree of C phrygian; likewise, phrygian is no higher than aeolian, and so on. To use a metaphorical mapping common in jazz chord-scale pedagogy, locrian is therefore the “darkest” of the diatonic modes and lydian the “brightest.” This paper generalizes that phenomenon to the modes of arbitrary scales. Most scales do not admit a simple linear ordering in terms of brightness. Instead, most scales exhibit a partial order in which some modes are neither brighter nor darker than others. This partial order offers a way of characterizing a scale’s internal construction at a productive level of generality.
After motivating the concept of brightness with analyses of passages from Mozart’s <i>Don Giovanni</i> and two works by Saint-Saëns, the paper explores several concepts and useful results for modelling modal brightness. These include two different partial orders of brightness, a description of the geometry underlying scales’ varying structures, and a pair of constants that characterize different scales. (Perhaps surprisingly, the natural definition of evenness is not a useful characterization, as scales representing any structure can be made arbitrarily even.) The theory provides a framework that draws together geometric, algebraic, and combinatoric models of musical scales, offering a generalization of concepts like “well formedness” to all scales.

Using Interactive Software to Enhance Mapping of Complex
Multi-dimensional and Dynamic Musical Relationships
Analytical charts and diagrams have traditionally been printed on paper and as such have been fixed and static. The two-dimensional page is also limited in the amount of information that can be presented clearly. However, musical structures are, more often than not, very complex, with multiple interrelations which evolve dynamically.
This presentation will examine ways in which software can help facilitate analytical representations that better reflect this complexity and multi-dimensionality of dynamically transforming interrelations. Examples will be presented from previously completed analyses and current work on the IRiMaS project (‘Interactive Research in Music as Sound,’ funded for five years, 2017–22, by a European Research Council Advanced Grant) will also be discussed and illustrated. An aim of this project is to extend such analytical techniques to a broader repertoire and facilitate their wider use. Our analyses to date were produced as completed packages with the participation of expert programmers. One aspect of IRiMaS involves developing tools for use by non-technical music researchers, enabling them to adopt a similar analytical approach, creating their own extensible interactive analyses independently of specialist technical support. These tools are also being developed so as to encourage use with a much broader range of musics, including non-Western music, aural/oral traditions, improvisation, and spectral music. Interactive aural software offers new possibilities for analysts, with the opportunity to enhance the way analysis is presented, and it also potentially changes the way analysts and their readers work.

Extending the Parallel Multiple-Analysis Processor:
Perceived Meter in Post-Tonal Music
The extent to which meter is perceived in rhythmically irregular post-tonal music has been a matter of speculation and investigation for several decades and is still not entirely agreed upon. Some early acknowledgements of the problem (Lester 1986; Lewin 1987), as well as more fully developed theories (Lerdhal and Jackendoff 1983; Roeder 1994; Hasty 1997), privilege perceived periodicity over the notated meter. At the same time, strict periodicity has been called into question by theories incorporating non-isochronous meters (London 2012), motive-driven aperiodic meter (Horlacher 1995), and other irregular metric structures (Kramer 1988; Leong 2011).
I approach the issue from the perspective of local regularity: if meter, isochronous or otherwise, is perceived in rhythmically irregular post-tonal music, it must arise from an attempt to entrain to regularity at the moment-to-moment level. Mirka’s (2009) parallel multiple-analysis processor is especially suited to account for such real-time, predictive metric processing. I extend her model to account for (1) standard non-isochronous meters, (2) fluctuating sensations of meter in more deeply irregular music, (3) meter in multiple perceptual streams, and (4) music that systematically subverts metric processing. I situate the discussion in passages by Babbitt, Barber, Carter, Feldman, Henze, and Webern, in which perceived meter is tied to structural and expressive aspects of pitch, form, and text. I also discuss the relationship between my theoretical generalizations and work on temporal thresholds (London 2012), metrical reinterpretation (Temperley 2008), metrical dissonance (Krebs 1999), selective attention (Jackendoff 1987), and modular perception (Temperley 1995).

On the Fluidity of Afro-Cuban Meter
Using data from ensemble drumming performances recorded by Andrew McGraw in Santiago de Cuba, I show how fluid metric complexes emerge from the superposition of distinct interweaving patterns. Factors shaping this fluidity include not only the characteristic non-simultaneities of African diasporic music but also the metric disposition (binary- or ternary-leaning) of the individual layers as well as their degree of adherence to strict cyclical repetition. In addition to these temporal dimensions, we will consider the amplitude contours of the cycled patterns, thereby expanding our view of meter as something richer and more nuanced than a discrete stacking of on-and-off dots. We will examine performances that differ in instrumentation, number of players, and core timeline in order to highlight commonalities while keeping check on the risks of overgeneralization. The presentation will also touch on pragmatic questions of methodology concerning data representation and manipulation in the study of rhythm.

In this paper, I present examples of contemporary African-American popular music that have been produced through unorthodox application of the digital audio workstation, focusing on the ways in which creative use of technology has changed how music sounds. As part of this, I discuss how sound processing is used to manipulate the “width” of beats and change the perceived timing of rhythmic events.

Groove on the Brain: Predictive Brain Processes
Underlying the Experience of Musical Rhythm
Musical rhythm has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. I describe how the theory of predictive coding (PC) can be used as a framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain. This theory posits a hierarchical organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future events. Musical rhythm exploits the brain’s general principles of prediction and that the pleasure and desire for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm could be a result of such mechanisms.
Exemplified by the music of Miles Davis, I here review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory.

The Form of Fantasy and the Fantasy of Form
in the Writings of A. B. Marx
Adolph Bernhard Marx (1799–1866) did not mince words about the “goal of the whole <i>Formenlehre</i>”: “in it and with it, and through it,” he wrote, “we become free.” Contrary to received wisdom, what Marx called the “last steps to freedom” are not taken in sonata form. Rather, they happen in “fantasy,” which, he wrote, “can follow no predetermined path or have a predetermined form, because it is indeed just the giving up of such a determined form.” Marx’s fantasy thus conforms to Seth Brodsky’s psychoanalytic reading of musical fantasy as a constitutive gap, a “code of no code, an executive order suspending order, a masterful unmastery.” Fantasy is the form with no form.
And yet, Marx cites specific, determinate examples of fantasy. Pieces by Mozart and Beethoven become opportunities to leverage a discourse in which, as Brodsky observes, “‘freedom’ becomes [the] urtext, a mortified signifier it is now tasked with revivifying and filling out.” In short, Marx turns the musical form of fantasy into a fantasy about musical form, a fantasy in Freud’s sense: a “fulfillment of a wish, a correction of an unsatisfying reality” that represses “distressing ideas…[that] threaten happiness or self-esteem.” These distressing ideas, I argue, originated in Marx’s Jewish heritage and were experienced through the politics of German-Jewish assimilation. His fantasy, manifested in a working-through of musical forms, thus reveals the political stakes of <i>Formenlehre</i> at the moment of its historical articulation.

Theorizing Sonata from the Margins:
Manuel Blasco de Nebra's <i>Seis Sonatas</i> (1780) in Context
Recent developments in <i>Formenlehre</i> have provided new insight into classical form (Caplin 1998; Hepokoski and Darcy 2006); however, such scholarship has tended to privilege Viennese classicism in its codification of ideal formal types and norms. For this reason, an uncritical application of such methods obscures rather than elucidates conventional practice when applied to works in parallel traditions. The occasional music-theoretic approaches to Spanish keyboard music (Powell 1980; Sutcliffe 2014; Igoa Mateos 2014) of composers such as Vicente Rodríguez (1690–1760), Joaquín Oxinaga (1719–89), Sebastian Albero (1722–57), Félix Máximo López (1742–1821), Narciso Casanovas (1747–99), Manuel Blasco de Nebra (1750–83), and Joaquin Montero (1764–1815) have not accounted for the possibility of a<i> Formelehre</i> tradition parallel to that of Viennese classicism. This paper takes Blasco de Nebra’s <i>Seis sonatas para clave y fuerte-piano</i> (1780) as a point of departure in order to demonstrate how classical norms may be reexamined and reevaluated to account for such a collection in its own historical context. Retheorizing both thematic construction as well as sonata structure from the perspective of these Spanish sonatas provides better insight into these works than the presuming of some ideal (Austro-Germanic) sonata form. In this paper, I will outline the general formal features of Blasco de Nebra’s keyboard sonatas and provide examples of earlier and contemporary works in order to demonstrate how these same features—often atypical for the Viennese composers—are normative for the keyboard sonata in this region.

The Joy of <i>Sextabsätze</i>:
The Deceptive Cadence and Other Such Slippery Events
Is a V–VI deceptive cadence truly a “cadence”? Many argue that it is not, claiming that a V–VI motion merely delays the arrival of an ensuing authentic cadence. Yet even within pieces composed during the 18th-century, some phrases do indeed conclude with a V–VI progression, with ramifications that deeply affect the work’s narrative structure. The concepts of Heinrich Christoph Koch provide avenues for thinking about these and other such unsettled phrase endings in a manner that is far more fluid than what is typical of modern theoretical approaches and in ways that can inform both analysis and performance.

Vocal Pitch in Rap Music
When analyzing rap music, vocal pitch is likely not the first parameter one considers. Indeed, one of the defining aspects of the rap genre is its tendency to eschew the precisely-pitched vocals heard in nearly all other popular music. However, there are countless examples of rap tracks in which MCs are consciously pitching their vocals using a variety of techniques, emphasizing pitch in a way that paradoxically seems at odds with one of the very defining characteristics of rap music.
In this presentation, I contend that pitch plays an important role in the structure and delivery of rap flows. I demonstrate the ways in which rappers manipulate pitch to create a structural parameter that can operate independently from or in tandem with rhythm and rhyme. Furthermore, I argue that pitched vocals take a wider array of forms in rap music than in other genres of popular music, ranging from carefully-pitched singing of modern rap flows to the imprecise and exaggerated declamatory features of speech that distinguished rap from other genres during its formative years. I assert that all rap flows can be classified as using pitch in one of five different ways, with each technique carrying its own unique set of analytical implications.

The "Ahhs" Have It:
Wordless Melismas and the Ineffable in Popular Music
In his 2010 <i>Popular Music</i> article, songwriter Pete Astor defends the discursive and emotive primacy of lyrics: “There is for me a greater value to those compositions with lyrics, a sense that the material that contains the greatest level of emotional commitment is always that where words are employed…” On the other hand, Johan Fornäs argues that “the text/music dichotomy is an illusion. They are not each other’s Other.” This raises a tantalizing question: What of music that is performed by the human voice, yet nonverbal?
This presentation explores such music, specifically how extended passages of nonverbal singing in popular music—“wordless melismas” (WMs)—help the voice transcend the expressive limits of the verbal and assume the apparently ineffable qualities of the instrumental. WMs are monosyllabic passages found in their own musically distinct section, usually bridges or concluding sections. Songs may have recurring or multiple different WMs. Additionally, WMs are not background elements, nor are they repeated (and often nonsensical) syllables like “na na” or “sha-la-la.” From these criteria, we have extrapolated four functions WMs fulfill within a song’s form and narrative, the details and examples of which we expound upon in greater detail in the presentation: introductory (“Welcome to the Jungle,” Guns N’ Roses), conclusive (“Criminal,” Fiona Apple), transformative (“You Oughta Know,” Alanis Morissette), and climactic (“With Or Without You,” U2). In each of these cases, the voice occupies a previously unexplored border region between the vocal and the instrumental, the verbal and the ineffable.

To Be the Music:
Mimetic Engagement with Caroline Shaw's <i>Partita for 8 Voices</i>
The program note to Caroline Shaw’s Pulitzer-prize-winning <i>Partita for 8 Voices</i> (2012) includes an unusual instruction: prompted by uproarious reaction at its premiere to an “explosive” D-major reprise in the final movement, listeners are encouraged to “holler or clap any time you feel like it.” These and other embodied reactions to the piece are a kind of mimetic engagement  (Cox 2011; 2016). The <i>Partita</i>’s invitation to mimetic engagement is made particularly strong by its unusual vocal techniques. Shaw plays with the “edges” of the voice, weaving into the music a physicality that Western classical vocal technique often diminishes. Mimetic engagement can manifest as identification with a performer (Heidemann 2016), but with multiple voices, Shaw’s <i>Partita</i> lacks this focal point. Instead, mimetic engagement informs the perceived relationship between performative action and “the music itself.” In this analysis I draw both from Cox and from Eric Clarke’s notion of a musical “virtual world” (Clarke 2005), understanding “the music” as a separable energy or plane of existence, rather than equivalent to performative action. I present two possible relationships between music and performance: performance <i>unveiling</i> the music, and music and performer mutually <i>striving </i>for each other. I focus primarily on the second movement ("Sarabande") for examples of each, and conclude with an exploration of the D-major reprise of "Passacaglia," which combines elements of both relationships.

Reinterpretation as Cultural Practice:
Sketches for a Cover Song Continuum
The website SecondHandSongs counts nearly 300,000 covers from any linguistic or cultural origin. By their own admission, this is likely a vast underestimation. If this points to anything, it is that cover songs are an unquestionably important medium of cultural expression in popular music around the globe. Yet, outside of analyses focused on individual original-cover pairings, scholarship has paid little attention to the overall cultural practice of covering.
In this paper, I suggest a possible way forward by advancing a theory that sees originals as “strategies,” or institutional forces, which artists use, adapt, and resist through the individual creative decisions—or tactics—made in the creation new versions. These decisions can be thought to lie on a continuum where similarity (isomorphism) and difference (metamorphism) are plotted against each other. Thus, they are construed as co-productive aspects of interpretation; a tactic that will always result in both likeness and contrast, albeit in differing proportions. By understanding these proportions in each tactic across the whole cover, specific observations about how the artist’s interpretation of the song can be advanced. The Eagles of Death Metal’s version of “Save A Prayer” (2015), originally by Duran Duran (1982), serves as a case study. By examining pronunciation, production, lyrics, performance, genre, register, harmony, counterpoint, and timbre, I argue that the cover band’s interpretation is deliberately resistant to the original in order to create new meanings more in line with their identity.

The <i>Techné</i> of YouTube Performance: Musical Structure, Extended Techniques, and Custom Instruments in Solo Pop Covers
They begin with a note, a chord, the tap of a button, or the triggering of a loop: through progressively layered textures, samples, and extended performance techniques, solo cover songs on YouTube often construct themselves piece by piece before the viewer’s eyes and ears. Combining virtuosity and novelty in a package ready-made for viral online popularity, this recent and rapidly growing internet phenomenon draws together traditions old and new, from the “one-man band” of the 19th century, to the experimental live looping of 1980s performance art, to contemporary electronic music. This presentation examines three recent popular YouTube videos in order to study the ways in which amateur musicians craft such arrangements through a combination of creativity and music-analytical understanding.
Building on a number of recent studies that examine the affordances and restrictions of writing and performing music on various instruments, I explore how these YouTube performers use theoretical and instrumental expertise to convey complex textures through a minimal collection of musical materials. In each case, the instruments themselves are arranged, modified, or even created in order to make these performances possible. The videos often incorporate looped or layered elements, arranged to take advantage of a song’s harmonic or rhythmic structures; and they frequently feature customized, self-created, or otherwise unconventional instrumentation. Through their sparse, economic construction, these intricate arrangements are each the end product of a careful analysis of each song, and they have much to teach us about the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic structures of popular music.

Amateur Music Theory as Participatory Culture
Public-facing music theory is a topic gaining steam among academic music theorists, particularly given the digital networks in which such discourse can thrive. Indeed, much public music theory is disseminated online, over social networks that blur the formal and informal. At the nexus of these blurred lines is the increasingly popular arena of educational social media channels, many of which feature music analysis of narrative screen media.
This paper focuses on online content that is advertised as a “music theory” approach to understanding media, in which amateur analysts position themselves not as authority figures but as fellow lovers and fans of the media they analyze. Following Kiri Miller’s (2012) ethnography of amateur-to-amateur online pedagogues or “A2A,” I argue that this particular practice shows evidence of an emerging participatory culture of music fans that includes amateur analysts alongside other kinds of musicians and enthusiasts.
In exploring responses to this online content, this paper also considers the discursive role of music theory in valuating popular musics as worthy of analysis for their structural complexity; music theory operates as a methodology of legitimization that uncovers the “secrets” of the music as well as the musical values of its fans. I further consider the unmarked politics of identity in this sphere, reflecting on how and why these videos are overwhelmingly produced by young white men. Examining who participates in this emergent participatory practice can shed light on why, how, and for whom music theory and analysis exists and persists.
