<p>As an academic press, our mandate is to serve the world of scholarship and culture as a professional, not-for-profit publisher. Founded in 1950, we are recognized internationally as a leading academic publisher specializing in the humanities and social sciences. We produce more than 120 new books annually, in addition to 40 journals, and maintain a backlist of some 3,500 titles. The Press emphasizes scholarship but also publishes text, trade, and reference titles.</p>
