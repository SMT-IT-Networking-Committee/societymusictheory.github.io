<p><a href="http://kingwilliamculturalartsdistrict.com/">King William Historic District</a>, sometimes referred to as South Town, is a beautiful historic neighborhood for food/drinks/historic neighborhood walking about a one-mile walk (or two-mile drive) from the conference.

<p>No visit to San Antonio is complete without seeing the <a href="http://www.thealamo.org/">Alamo</a>! It’s located about one half mile from the hotel conference. Touring the mission and its beautiful grounds are free. There are four other Missions (Concepción, San José, San Juan and Espada) south of the city.
