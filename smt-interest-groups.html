<h2>Improvisation</h2>
<p class="ig-time">Saturday, 5:45-7:45 pm, <span class="room-fullsize">Travis AB</span></p>

<p>On behalf of the SMT Interest Group on Improvisation, we are pleased
to announce that our interest group meeting will host a special panel on:
"Improvisation Studies, Do They Exist?" The panelists will be Sabine Feisst
(Arizona State University), Roger Moseley (Cornell University), and Chris
Stover (Arizona State University), followed by an open discussion with the
audience.</p>

<p>We are also holding a special joint session of the AMS/SMT, "Extemporaneous
Dialogues on Historical Improvisation: Bridging Music, Music History, and
Theory," (Thursday, Nov. 1st, 8-10PM), with short lecture-performances by
Peter Schubert (McGill University), Pamela Ruiter-Feenstra, Johnandrew
Slominski (Linfield College) &amp; Gilad Rabinovitch (Georgia State University),
with an introduction by Massimiliano Guido (University of Pavia). Our
respondent will be Anna Maria Busse Berger (UC Davis). </p>

<p>The session is built around four specific samples of improvised music that
stimulate a special interaction between a performer and a scholar in that
particular field.  Our aim is to help the audience understand the generative
process coupling music creation in a particular style to the embodied
knowledge necessary to achieve it. Each music-making situation will focus on a
possible research related issue such as: compositional rules and internalized
knowledge; relationship between instrument and performer; embodiment. This
session will also conclude with an open discussion.</p>

<p>The SMT Music and Philosophy Interest Group will be hosting a panel discussion
during its business meeting entitled "How we use philosophy for Music Theory"

discussion is to describe some of the many ways that philosophical thinking
can be used to support our work as music theorists without presuming a robust
background in any philosophical tradition. Younger scholars with an interest
in philosophy or scholars curious about how to engage philosophy in their work
are particularly encouraged to attend. Questions for the panel may be
submitted in advance to Ben Hansberry, Philosophy Interest Group Co-Chair, at
<a href="mailto:bhansber@mit.edu">bhansber@mit.edu</a>.</p>

and networking based on shared research interests. Groups are expected to be
about 7–9 members in size, based around the following topics: lyrics, timbre,
cognition, performance, tonality/modality, topic theory, corpus study, and
rhythm/meter. Discussion will be facilitated through prompts, and we will also
reconvene after approximately 50 minutes in groups to share what each group
discussed and achieved. At the end of our meeting, we will also announce the
winners of our two publication awards.</p>
