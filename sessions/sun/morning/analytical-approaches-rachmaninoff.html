<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>This session explores the music of Sergei Rachmaninoff from a variety of
theoretical and analytical perspectives. Rachmaninoff deserves special
attention: Despite being loved by performers and the public, his music has
been largely bypassed by analysts for decades. In the past roughly
quarter-century, however, there has been a renewed interest in his work among
English-language analysts. Of particular importance is Blair Johnston’s (2009,
3) call to put an end to the habit of viewing Rachmaninoff as a traditionalist
chained to outdated compositional methods. The function of our session is to
further this emerging interest in Rachmaninoff’s music, and thus help solidify
its legitimacy as an object of music-theoretical inquiry. Incidentally, 2019
marks a century and a year after Rachmaninoff’s permanent move to the United
States in November 1918.</p>

<p>The session brings together three scholars who explore (1) various
genres—piano, solo vocal, and choral; (2) different musical dimensions such as
tonal structures, form, and counterpoint; and (3) a multiplicity of
theoretical approaches, including the New Formenlehre and Russian theory
contemporary to Rachmaninoff. "Rotational Form in Three of Rachmaninoff's
<i>Études-tableaux</i>" explores novel approaches to form based on rotational
principles, with an emphasis on aspects of ambiguity. “Disguised Cadences in
Rachmaninoff’s Songs” discusses the composer’s experimentation with closure
that plays on common-practice conventions without abandoning them entirely.
“Horizontal-Shifting Counterpoint in Rachmaninoff” shows how the composer
advanced Taneev’s contrapuntal principles beyond the “strict” style to a new,
post-Romantic context.</p>
