<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>This special session focuses on the music of the British composer Thomas
Adès (b. 1971). A roll-call of the awards and recognition for Adès
demonstrates the global appeal of his music. Given the prominence and
unarguable success of Adès’s music, it is not surprising that he has been
subject to far greater musicological attention than many of his peers. A
positive review in <i>The New York Times</i> by Richard Taruskin of Adès’s
music became an early reference point. Taruskin argues that “for all its
precocious technical sophistication and its omnivorous range of reference […]
it does not put everything ‘in quotes.’ It has urgency and fervor, and
communicates directly” (Taruskin 1999/2000, 145).</p>

<p>In the last 15 years, there has been a growing body of articles, book
chapters, and theses and dissertations dedicated to, or featuring, Adès’s
music. The six papers in this integrated special session add to this growing
body of scholarly work. The session is timely, in that it occurs some two
decades after the publication of Taruskin’s review, enabling the contributors
to take stock of the evolving body of work dedicated to Adès, and to point to
future directions for the growing field of Adès studies. In this way, it will
be ideally positioned to make a significant contribution to the literature on
Adès’s music.</p>
