<h2>Part 1. Instrument-Making Activity (30 minutes)</h2>
<p class="sub-chair">Quintina Carter-Ényì (University of Georgia), Moderator</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ariel Alvarado (Spelman College)</li>
    <li>Donovan Polk (Morehouse College)</li>
    <li>Elaina Blake (Spelman College)</li>
    <li>Marvin Wayne Allen (Morehouse College)</li>
    <li>Ridge White (Morehouse College)</li>
    <li>Shelby Richardson (Spelman College)</li>
</ul>

<p>Workshop facilitators will lead participants in an instrument-making
activity with materials provided by Morehouse and Spelman Colleges. The
activity is linked to instructional materials for making lamellophones,
available on the
<a href="http://diversity.societymusictheory.org/SMT2019">SMT Committee on
    Race and Ethnicity’s website</a>,
with equipment commonly found on college and university campuses (e.g. laser cutters).</p>

<h2>Part 2. Lightning Talks on Diversifying Music Theory Pedagogy (120 minutes)</h2>

<p>Each talk will be followed by a 20-minute breakout discussion between the
members of the audience. Pre-assigned scribes will note these discussions, and
will share their highlights at the end of Part 2, to provide food for further
discussion, or action items that might be implemented in music theory
classrooms.</p>

<h2>Part 3. Performance Activity (30 minutes)</h2>
<p class="sub-chair">Quintina Carter-Ényì (University of Georgia), Moderator</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ariel Alvarado (Spelman College)</li>
    <li>Donovan Polk (Morehouse College)</li>
    <li>Elaina Blake (Spelman College)</li>
    <li>Marvin Wayne Allen (Morehouse College)</li>
    <li>Ridge White (Morehouse College)</li>
    <li>Shelby Richardson (Spelman College)</li>
</ul>

<p>In this last activity, the lamellophones made in Part 1 will be returned to
the audience after having been tuned. Once the instruments are returned,
workshop facilitators will guide groups of participants through performance
activities responding to the three topics of the lightning talks.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Learning a transcription of a cyclical process from Balinese Gamelan music</li>
    <li>Studying and practicing a new composition by Emily Koh (University of Georgia)</li>
    <li>Aural training exercises using lamellophones</li>
</ol>

<p>These performance activities will demonstrate multi-sensory learning
strategies for the classroom, and tools that may be used to implement the
action items discussed in Part 2 without significant cost to a department or
school of music.</p>
