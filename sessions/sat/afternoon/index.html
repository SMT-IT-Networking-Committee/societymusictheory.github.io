<h2>Reframing Music Theory</h2>
<p class="chair">Elizabeth Marvin (Eastman School of Music), Moderator</p>

<h2>Abstracts</h2>

<p>The field of music theory has been shaped by intersecting systems of knowledge
and power that involve race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability/disability,
culture, and nationality.  These four papers critique the confining frames
within which our field has been operating and explore ways in which to reframe
what constitutes music theory.</p>
