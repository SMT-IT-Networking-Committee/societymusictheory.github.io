<h1>Visiting Arlington, VA and the Greater Washington Area</h1>

<p>We look forward to welcoming you to our nation’s capital! Visitors will find that they will have to ration their time
as there are weeks’ worth of museums, parks, and other attractions in the Washington, D.C. area. And of course,
Americans frequently come to Washington to watch our government at work and to voice our opinions in person about how
that work is proceeding.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://renaissance-hotels.marriott.com/renaissance-arlington-capital-view-hotel" title="Renaissance Arlington home web page">Renaissance Arlington Capital View Hotel</a>
is located in Crystal City, Virginia, right across the Potomac River from downtown Washington. Numerous restaurants at
various price points may be found on Crystal Drive three blocks north of the hotel. Arlington Cemetery is a few stops
north of Crystal City on the Metro’s Blue line, and the bustling shops, restaurants, and historical sites of Old Town
Alexandria are a few stops south (on the Yellow or Blue lines). In Old Town, we recommend a tour of the <a
    href="https://gwmemorial.org" title="George Washington National Masonic Memorial web page">George Washington Masonic
    National Memorial</a>, which is very close to the King Street Metro stop.</p>

<p>Another appealing way to explore Arlington and Alexandria is on the bike path which borders the Potomac in both
directions. (See below for more information on renting a bike.) If you head north along the river, you will pass Reagan
National Airport and then find lovely views of the various monuments across the river. If you head south on the path,
you will reach Old Town in two-and-a-half miles. If you are really feeling ambitious, you can follow the bike path ten
more miles to George Washington’s home, <a href="http://www.mountvernon.org" title="Mount Vernon home web page">Mount
Vernon</a>.</p>

<p>Farther afield, the Smithsonian Institution comprises free museums of every description. Highlights on the National
Mall include the <a href="https://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/home/" title="Hirshhorn Museum home page">Hirshhorn
useum</a> (for modern art), the <a href="http://www.nmai.si.edu" title="National Museum of the American Indian home
page">American Indian Museum</a>, and the <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu" title="National Museum of African-American
HIstory and CUlture home page">African American Museum</a> (for which prearranged tickets will probably still be highly
advisable). Families with children will want to visit the <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu" title="National Air and
Space Museum home page">Air and Space Museum</a>, <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu" title="National Museum of
Natural History home page">Natural History Museum</a>, and the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu" title="National Zoo
home page">National Zoo</a>. The <a href="http://americanart.si.edu" title="American Art Museum home page">American Art
Museum and Portrait Gallery</a> are housed in a single building a few blocks north of the mall. Several justly famous
museums are not associated with the Smithsonian—the amazing <a href="https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb.html"
title="National Gallery of Art home page">National Gallery of Art</a> (which is on the National Mall), the <a
href="https://www.ushmm.org" title="US Holocaust Memorial Museum home page">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> (just south
of the Mall), and the <a href="http://www.phillipscollection.org" title="Phillips Collection home page">Phillips
Collection,</a>a</a> small jewel near Dupont Circle.


SMT members may be especially interested in the Performing Arts Reading Room at the James Madison Memorial Building of
the <a href="https://www.loc.gov" title="The Library of Congress home page">Library of Congress</a>. But we also highly
recommend a guided tour of the architecturally spectacular Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress, the site of
the Library’s Main Reading Room. The usical Instrument Collection at the <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu"
title="National Museum of American History home page">National Museum of American History</a> contains priceless
instruments from Europe as well as the Americas. The weekend of our conference will be an exciting one at the <a
href="http://www.kennedy-center.org" title="Kennedy Center home page">Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a>:
Leonard Slatkin will be leading the National Symphony Orchestra in <i>The Rite of Spring</i> and Angela Meade will be
singing Handel’s <i>Alcina</i> with the Washington National Opera.

Foodies are in for a treat. The burgeoning D.C. region food scene was recently recognized as the subject of a Michelin
Guide. The city and suburbs are particularly rich in excellent Chinese, Ethiopian, Korean, Mexican, and Vietnamese food.
Finally, we want to recommend a favorite Washington activity: strolling around three storied, beautiful neighborhoods:
Georgetown, Embassy Row, and the Capitol Hill neighborhood, just east of the Capitol.


<h2>Getting Around Arlington and DC</h2>



<p><a href="http://www.wmata.com" title="Metro home page">Metro</a>’s system of subway and surface trains is
almost certainly the easiest way to get around the DC area for visitors. All riders must have a plastic “Smarttrip”
card: note that these cards are personal, so cannot be used to pay more than one fare per trip.  These cards can be
bought at station vending machines, or online in advance of your trip. The fare system is arcane and convoluted, but if
you maintain $10 on your card, you will be good to go pretty much anywhere.  The large white “M” signs identify metro
stations.  In the downtown area most stations are underground; however all stations have elevator access and cars are
designed to be accessible. Smarttrip cards are also accepted on the <a href="https://www.wmata.com">Metrobus system</a>,
as well as on <a href="http://www.arlingtontransit.com" title="Arlington Transit home page"><b>Arlington Transit</b></a>
buses.</p>


<p>If you plan to use two wheels to get around, you’ll find that Arlington is a bike-friendly city and
Washington DC is regularly selected among the nation’s best cities for bikers. The conference hotel has complimentary
bike rental for guests, and <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com" title="Capital Bikeshare home page">Capital
    Bikeshare</a> offers its distinctive red bikes at over 400 stations around the metro area.  You can pay by the hour
or purchase a 24-hour or 3-day pass.  Bring your own helmet!</p>


<p>The DC area is well served with traditional taxis and with drivers for TNCs (transportation network companies). If
you require a wheelchair accessible cab, call Royal Taxi at 202-398-0500 or Yellow Paratransit at 202-544-1213. Note
that the metro region is regularly quoted as having the second-worst traffic in the nation, so driving is not
recommended to visitors as a mode of getting around, unless you must.
